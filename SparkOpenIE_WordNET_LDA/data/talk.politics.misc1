Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim
Perot was investigating him.  If you will state that you were in error
on this point, provided I produce the source, I'll go dig it up.

Now give me one reason why I should go to the trouble if you won't
agree to this?  It is simple enough you know.  But I don't have time
to waste if you'll just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually
post.

Which makes it legally unsound.  If I were representing Mr. Teel,
I'd try a procedural approach if I could find one, or recommend
he plea-bargain.  He's setting himself up to be in hot water.

How can you lie about something that no one knows for sure.  I am the first
to state that the 10% figure may be too high- but it may just be too low,
depending on what you are talking about.

Keep in mind that there are 'practicing' heterosexuals that are actually
gay.  These people chose to take a road that avoids being harassed and
they wanted to 'fit-in' with everyone other 'normal' person.

But let's get off of this irrational behavior of calling everyone a liar,
you cannot even start to support such claims.

This sure sounds definitive.  How do you label Kinsey's work like this,

This is an interesting statement.  Do you realize how many things you do

required on occasion that all parties may not be mutually consenting?

Oh I did not know that Le JoJo is a typical homosexual.

Stop making statements about something you know nothing about, that is
gay people.  You make your sweeping generalizations with no grounding
in reality.


What I hope is not true- That you are a typical heterosexual.  Anyone want
to comment on this?

And if you are typical then I can start extrapolating a lot of interesting
conjectures about heterosexuals.

Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things
Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those
who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their
claim, and (2) those who lose.

Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen
cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.
Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that
an individual has to file a return.

Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer
for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and
so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.

Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a
claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with
the tax code.

Unless I've got my notes mixed up, 939 F.2d 499 comes close to this.
Regular guy.  Blue-collar worker at a regular company.  Hauled into
court.  Convicted.  Appeals to 7th circuit.  Makes all the right
arguments (his brief is cited by Mr. Teel as an example of a
"winning" brief).  Shot down, 3-zip by the 7th circuit.  Appeals to
the Supreme Court.  And...

...Certiorari denied.  Defendant goes to jail.  Oh well.

Nice dodge. I give it a 9.2.

I've answered your question. Would you now answer mine.

The tax protesters are legally correct, but they are put in jail anyway.

The weakness of the governments legal position is shown by the fact that when
someone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial
(very rare) the feds blatantly stack the jury, with the same old faces turning
up time after time.

However Teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound, if
you follow it you will probably wind up in jail.

Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.
What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent
increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit
(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.
Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps
growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each
president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.
Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.

As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....

During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an
"economist" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his
arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know
with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government
policy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause"
economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and
create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is.

Undoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and
undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.

>Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price
>machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges.

Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.
Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred.

Can you spell "loss leader?"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader
for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.

But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide
comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had
risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.

There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD
substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction
of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears
that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers
are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.
(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to
Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)

The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government
intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial
results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that "government
bureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
should take such such cases into account.

Replying to A.J. Teel:

	Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
	stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a
	while now.

Humbug.  Those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.

Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This
issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of
federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).

Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material
"concrete proof".

	There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers
	finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their
	reasons for disbelief at this point.

Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've
posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I
feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such
strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the Supreme Court.

Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay
his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-
sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court
with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why
not; why haven't you?

	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the
	opposition has forfeited the field?

With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,
for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.

For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you
told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing.
Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?

Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?
Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US
officials to classify you as a "14th Amendment federal citizen"?  When
the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell
them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,
D.C., where they belong?

Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.
If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just
declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).

Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this
garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-
ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.

Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to
care too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a "14th Amend-
ment federal citizen", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep
on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably
not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
and/or the foreign tax credit).

this demolition--forced breeding programs or something?

Now let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how
people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)
are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that
works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
for themselves?

There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
support systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I
don't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any
sane person's list.

You want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for
a lasting change for the worse, try so-called "relevant" or "values"
education.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  How were
we to know you needed a real education first--I mean, we took that
for granted.

I"M CHANGING MY NAME TO CHRYSLER
(Tom Paxton, 1980)

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us
Now won't buy a head of lettus
No the economic forecast isn't right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I caneven glimpse a new and better way
And I've devised a plan of action
Worked it down to the last fraction
And I'm going into action here today.

Chorus:

  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am going down to Washington D.C.
  I will tell some power broker
  What they did for Iacoca
  Will be perfectly acceptable to me.
  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am heading for that great receiving line
  So when they hand a million grand out
  I'll be standing with my hand out
  Yes sir I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can go
They won'y have to scream and holler
They'll all be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seam to flow
I'll be glad to tell them all what they can do
Its just a matter of a simple form or two
It's not renumeration it's a liberal education
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you

Chorus

Since the first first amphibians crawled out of the slime
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And it's sad failure is an awful crime
It's been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems there's a different point of view
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down in congress there is a safety net for you.

Chorus...



Perhaps Steven Jobs should take Paxton's advice and change his name to
Chrysler, or perhaps set himself up as an S&L, maybe Neil Bush could
give him a hand?

I followed up without a thought of double-checking...if I double-checked

Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around.

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with
free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic
competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution
was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.

So the only people who are citizens of a state are ones who don't live

There is nothing crystal clear about YOU PEOPLE other than a term
that includes those people defined by the statement that anyone who
believes that the behavior is justifiable is a bigoted, racist pig and
YOU PEOPLE know who you are.

                 1993 LIBERTARIAN PARTY NATIONAL CONVENTION
                             AND POLITICAL EXPO

                   THE MARRIOTT HOTEL AND THE SALT PALACE
                            SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH

                   INCLUDES INFORMATION ON DELEGATE DEALS!

The convention will be held at the Salt Palace Convention Center and the
Marriott Hotel, Salt Lake City, Utah.  The business sessions, Karl Hess
Institute, and Political Expo are at the Salt Palace; breakfasts, parties, and
banquet are at the Marriott Hotel.

Marriott Hotel room rates are $79.00 night, plus 10.5% tax ($87.17 total).
This rate is good for one to four persons room occupancy.  Double is one
or two beds; 3 or 4 people is 2 beds.  You can make your reservations
direct with the hotel (801-531-0800), or you can purchase your room
through one of MGP's payment plans.  MGP will provide assistance in

August 30, 31, Sept. 1:           Everything You Always Wanted to
                                  Know About Winning Elections, but
                                  Didn't Know Where to Ask!

Three days of intensive campaign training conducted by Sal Guzzetta, a
25 year veteran of more than 200 campaigns.  Students receive 990 pages
of professional campaign manuals.  Everything from strategy and
targeting to opposition research, fundraising, and field operations.

Price:           $150 if purchased by May 1, 1993
                 $175 thereafter

August 31 and Sept. 1:            Platform, Bylaws, Credentials and
                                  National committee meetings.

Shoot out in Salt Lake!  PLEDGE versus Committee for a Libertarian
Majority.  Will the party's membership and platform definitions change?
Is compromise possible?  The Platform and Bylaws committees are
responsible for making recommendations to the convention concerning
changes in those documents.  At this convention, the party will only
consider deletions to the platform.  The Convention Rules would have to
be amended by a 2/3 vote to change this rule.

The meetings are open to the public.  There is no charge for attending.

The key word is `spilled'.  If semen was spilled anywhere where there
was a chance of procreation it was OK.  If it was spilt on the ground or
in to a man it was a big sin, ditto with animals. The jews said sex=pro-
creation.

Homosexuals didn't breed, there fore they are evil and should be stoned
to death.

GOT HIM!  Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation
rather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  This changes the whole
argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all
of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  Peds are peds who
may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though
most do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic
ped nature.

Cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different
orientations.  All we need now is to get him to admit that
the apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions.

Who gave you the authority to create and enforce this rather

we don't need to stick to it or stick up for it unless we so

If I have confused two different stories, it was an honest mistake but I do

Very simple.  An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator.
It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot
make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say
scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have
to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For
the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative
bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all
know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.
along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So
Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance
of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam
companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to
have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.

Last night I heard something about Bill Clinton's sister being
involved in a marijuana bust, and the news being suppressed. I also
heard something about her being an "ex-con". This source is not
reliable, though. (It was a collage/booklet advertising a local band.)

Can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details? I'm
surprised I haven't seen anything about this in this newsgroup.

Also, does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a
regular pot smoker when she was in college? This ghastly accusation
was reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated, then I
never heard anything about it again.

It's almost enough to make me want to start an Act-Up type campaign
to invade the privacy of closet smokers! (If only this type of
publicity didn't violate people's rights. . . .)

I can only say that those people are wrong. The word harass means to
irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but
the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to
make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.

The number of people who participate in "victimless" crimes notwithstanding,
the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume
that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face.

Enemy?  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked
conservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  I suggest you
listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying
and compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his
opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.

Oh, BTW, Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII,
hasn't it?

Better to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those
nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not
be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if
they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large
parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot
imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.

How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if
vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something.
A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is
bound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the
humanitarian argument that democracies should help other
democracies (or struggling democracies).)

Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid.
My two "causes" are aid to Russia and a strong space program.
Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies
of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a
true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we
only have gridlock on a congressional scale.

BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who
want to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of
thing I thought Libertarians were against.

Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue
and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems
that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and
let it sink or swim.  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.
Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and
global decision making.

Sorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys
from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex
(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least
some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the
children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a
practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them. By working together "with good will on both sides", we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.

Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for
personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*
stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish
and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the
future.

I agree mostly with Chris.  It is (unfortunately, IMO) true that the *FBI*
figures for rape based on the 'uniform crime report' report only female
rapes. However, some states (such as Illinois) are not tabluated because they
refuse to comply with this sexist definition!

You mean, if a large part of the population supports discrimination

There may be some confusion here.  The Uniform Crime Reports program
run by the FBI defines rape as a female victim only crime -- even
though some states have the laws de-sexed.  I suspect that this causes
male victims of rape to be left out of the UCR data.

Yet, when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this
philosophy to cigarette smokers (so that people who smoked away
from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers),
the liberal Gov. Wilder vetoed it.  Which shows that liberals don't
give a damn about "best person for the job," it's just a power
play.

Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political

This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_

production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted
from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming?  When did this first appear?

Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as

basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same
rights as a free person, but they were never considered "not human" to

If that were the case, the slave states would not have passed so many
laws that restricted the freedom of slave owners to do as they wished
with their property.  Examples: laws prohibiting manumission without
legislative grant; laws prohibiting teaching slaves to read & write.

Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that
capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.

Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not
in 1850.

# #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's -

#
# That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because

#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have
#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come
#  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile,

#  "Cruel Hearts and Hatred for Black People" would have been driven out of
#  business. Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_
#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.

This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt
that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive
threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the
maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local
governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside
capital investment in the Southern states.

Of course, free trade and slavery don't make much sense together in
a phrase anyway.  Perhaps Mr. Depken meant, "low import tariffs," but
that is quite a bit less than "free trade."

I don't think that this is accurate. I believe, and could be wrong, that
there IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated, like the

Double jeopardy does not apply, but not for the reasons you quote. Double
jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge.
However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force
or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating
Mr. King's civil rights.

AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once,
it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states
have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states,
it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence. Also,
I think murder is against federal, but not some state laws.

    You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice,
communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_
productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of "kulaks"
in the USSR is a good instance of this.
    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder
just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would
have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed
him off, or been killed?
    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,
load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of
obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,
if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die
crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to
socialists in Chile.
    It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes
it's a sheer waste of time.

Since you asked, Article I Section 1.  Article I Section 8.  Article I
Section 10.  Article II Section 2.  Article VI.  Sixteenth Amendment.

	This is such a fine example of Jack's antisemitic bigotry that I
couldn't help but do a follow-up.

	A poster attempts to discuss an event rationally, with no indication
at all that he is identified with any specific ethnic group - he is merely
talking in terms that might apply to ANY group in similar circumstances.

	Schmidling comes back with a rabid attack against YOU PEOPLE, as if
it were crystal clear that the Jewish people as a whole were culpable for this
man's statements - even if he were not Jewish. Jack considers the Jewish people
to be responsible for all the acts of the supporters of Israel, irrespective of
their age, religion, gender, skin color, or sexual orientation.

	The .sig, please.

	My mother-in-law, who grew up in Germany, doesn't believe in
money at all. She started out as a real estate developer, and now raises
horses. She keeps telling me that inflation is coming back, and to lock
in my fixed rate mortgage as low as possible.

	The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the "B"
word, or the "H" word, or even the "N" or "W" words. It is the "L" word -
LOSER !!

	That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it
is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.

	Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail
buffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.
The eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then
(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.
No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer
(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no
holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a
few "little" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an
S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to
contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had
it so good.

	In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one
doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a "kinder and gentler
type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of
discourse about people who "don't get it". For those of us in the winning
business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no
suggestion of losing.

	But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our
"white male" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out
photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one
with a "Hail Mary" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three
yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses
in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the
weapon of choice these days.

	Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on
your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This
is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt
sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the
same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to
take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?

	What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is
the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood
used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott
declaimed, "Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will
not tolerate a loser." And so on.

	The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and
Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some
"equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a
loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian
homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined
day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)
minority.

	Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most
conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care
who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something
about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).
In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a
"neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limit
the pot.

	Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be
popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still
be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I
would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it
is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any
other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in
Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in
the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to
see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious
preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of
them be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl
someday)

   This I gotta see some authority for.

from Black's Law Dictionary, Revised 4th Ed., page 1473:

RESIDENCE.  A factual place of abode.  Living in a particular
locality.  Reese v. Reese, 179 Misc. 665, 40 N.Y.S.2d 468, 472;
Zimmerman, 175 Or. 585, 155 P.2d 293, 295.  It requires only bodily
presence as an inhabitant of a place.  In re Campbell's Guardianship,
216 Minn. 113, 11 N.W.2d 786, 789.

     As ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place,
they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are
not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as
in the city and country, but only one domicile.  Residence means
living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that
locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence
simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place,
while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an
intention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S.
209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties
than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite
period if intent to return remains.  Immigration Act 1917, sec. 3, 8
U.S.C.A. sec. 136 (e, p).  Transatlantica Italiana v. Elting,
C.C.A.N.Y., 74 F.2d 732, 733.  But see, Ward v. Ward, 115, W.Va 429,
176 S.E. 708, 709; Southwestern Greyhound Lines v. Craig, 182 Okl.
610, 80 P 2d 221, 224; holding that residence and domicile are
synonymous terms.  ``Residence'' has a meaning dependent on context
and purpose of statute.  In re Jones, 341 Pa. 329, 19 A.2d 280, 282.
Words ``residence'' and ``domicile'' may have an identical or variable
meaning depending on subject-matter and context of statute.  Kemp v.
Kemp, 16 N.Y.S.2d 26, 34, 172 Misc. 738.

     Legal residence.  See Legal.

RESIDENT.  One who has his residence in a place.  See Residence.

     Also a tenant, who was obliged to reside on his lord's land, and
not to depart from the same; called, also, ``homme levant et
couchant,'' and in Normandy, ``resseant du fief.''

And who's advocating that?  Hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations
of the acts.  Just like premeditated homicide is treated stricter than
heat-of-passion homicide.

So if I set off a bomb in the World Trade Center, I can only be charged with
more than one murder, and not the other five deaths and extensive property
damage?  After all, the bomb was a single act.

Glad to see that you agree that the current Government is reticent
about admitting the sovereignty of the people!  Speaking from personal
experience, I have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after
I demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the
DA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action
and hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 ("The judges of
the appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in
any cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it
advisable or in the public interest.").  That is reality, I agree.

Maybe we should ask the 83,103 people who were laid off this January whether
or not we're in a recession. That was a figure that was reported in the
New York Times. There is no official figure, because the Bureau of Labor
Statistics stopped government tracking of layoffs eight months ago due to
budget cuts.

Again, Mr. Frank has come to the rescue with his cool headed reason.  How
about, "One charge per victim?"  Of course I'll think about it in a few days
and find a case where this doesn't apply either.

Wasn't the beef with the English over "taxation WITHOUT REPRESENTATION",
not taxation itself?

From my admittedly dim recollection of US history, most of the problems
we Americans have had with taxes have been with unfair/unjust taxation
schemes, not with taxes themselves.  It's pretty hard to run a government
without any means of support.

Maybe because the claims deserve refute?  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung
problems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered
their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  I'm going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow.

What justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of
research?  Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not
prove anything.

Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they
effect people differently.

Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that
function just fine in society.

NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis
is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they
are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,
and that makes them stronger.

the hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as
a *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.

[...]

In general, I somewhat see what you're saying.  And people like Jack Herer
contribute to this.  This has been quite a big mind-fuck for me recently,
and I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust _ANYBODY_ by
word of mouth alone -- my attitude about the general population has
decreased significantly.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration
rate for violent crimes.

So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism
present.

There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.

Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern
United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in
the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt
blacks.

In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are
reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).

Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and
some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a
situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the
population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,
except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!

The 1960's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible.

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything -- going overboard and creating a nation of
brats.

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969.

Apollo 11 and Woodstock.

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives (defecation in public etc.).

And which group assembled, took care of itself, and dispersed with no damage,
no deaths, no large numbers of drug problems ....

--
There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster. Weird, eh?

These opinions are MINE, and you can't have 'em! (But I'll rent 'em cheap ...)

Well, the message was interesting (and long), but TWICE? Oh Well. Personally,
I loathe libertarianism, but my disagreement is philisophical, not tactical.
Election law reform is a good idea. You would not believe what kind of stunts
the creatures of the 2 party system are capable of pulling.

Boy is this guy in for a shock when he hits the real world!  Our tax rate
is incredibly high, higher than many European countries -- it is just
packaged differently (income, Social inSecurity, Medicare, payroll taxes,
property taxes, sales taxes, fees, mandatory disability insurance, state,
federal, local, etc. etc. etc.).  Other countries just haven't found as
many ways to hide "revenue enhancers" as our clever American politicians.

I hope you enjoy the $8K you actually get to spend from your first $25K
job out of school, Rob, you patriot you.

My apologies.  Your right.  I wasn't following the thread.  But I think
most women are tougher than that.  I am suprised that someone would
insinuate that women are in some way so vunerable.

  Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds

  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency
  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel
  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato
  Institute points out.

    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,
  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10
  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of
  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as
  dramatically.

    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial
  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy
  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group
  of Seven nations.

    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil
  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the
  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,
  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the
  overall U.S. economy.

    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per
  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.

    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side
  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource
  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not
  reduce demand.

    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes
  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that
  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,
  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood
  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state
  at the expense of the individual.

    "Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion" is no.

                        The Cato Institute

    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research
  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate
  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the
  traditional American principles of limited government, individual
  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve
  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in
  questions of policy and the proper role of government.
    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets
  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th
  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation
  of the American Revolution.
    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually
  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive
  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary
  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for
  civil liberties.
    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive
  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy
  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned
  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military
  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy
  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are
  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.
    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts
  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,
  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from
  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,
  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue
  Code.

This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,
DC  20006.

   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,
1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.

  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South
Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute
between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept
Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far
more than that.

   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a
giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,
fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South
Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the
hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on
all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the
Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.

   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of
the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a
counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.

   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of
time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is
coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are
overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot
simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time
without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British
will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no
matter how risky they may be.

   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no
choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That
reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered
losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will
be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by
the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts
will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle
losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice
but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking
even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,
my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.

   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,
ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing
countless commentators referring to the British task force as an
"armada" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very
uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400
years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,
but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it
changed the course of history--and it was none other than the
English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.

   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the
reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion
fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.
They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake
and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada
by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped
with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of
reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered
the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely
half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's
defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened
the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its
expansion into a truly global empire.

   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full
circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the
world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now
the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in
confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for
invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four
hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;
today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.

   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake
Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of
the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's
naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may
well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal
Navy.

   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:

Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND
Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.

Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month
it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and
a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great
Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the
Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been
countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it
calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing
in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about
them.

   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba
is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.
After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer
than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the
remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,
and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are
watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.

   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all
about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's
doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's
got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,
submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have
even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.
Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated
and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and
submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and
sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has
grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada
numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has
already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.

   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this
fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the
major media is "oil."  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist
under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,
but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it
explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina
this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine
seizure of South Georgia Island.

   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with
no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South
Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia
Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,
glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.
On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or
historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it
stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.

   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by
Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took
over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,
Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,
not Britain.

   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It
has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or
Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even
more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's
leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They
were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island
could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were
setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island
was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's
military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia
Island at all?

   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,
not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an
enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation
buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.
The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret
installation, together with two other similar installations which
I will describe shortly.

   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many
years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear
war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in
Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the
details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain
and verify them.

   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of
this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat
that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.

   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of
the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The
mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the
Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are
behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of
the "PROJECT Z" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase
is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both
Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR
ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the
existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around
the world.

   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are
working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of
other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to
ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in
Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie
smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered
remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the
secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the
open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining
fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using
that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of
the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to
pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off
NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel
and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a
race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.

   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are
benefitting from war preparations which were started by the
Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since
the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United
States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United
States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal
power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.
But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades
both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller
Brothers.

   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world
domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half
secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.
It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret
while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the
details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By
deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United
States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.
Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be
unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.

   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the
Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the
late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that
the war being planned would have very different effects on the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United
States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern
Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great
Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the
strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are
relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected
that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern
Hemisphere war.

   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious
radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas
not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the
war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is
very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from
the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then
it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image
of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.
Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,
but very little of the air changes places.

   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming
nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for
generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the
Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.
This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A
quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller
cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I
discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson
Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during
the war.  He accomplished this as so-called "Coordinator of
Hemispheric Defense" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
So that takes care of the South American continent and its
natural resources.

   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller
control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,
especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the
efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER
No. 36.

   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land
masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and
New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the
Rockefellers.

   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military
installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming
war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the
surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern
Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually
recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire
would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third
generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to
inherit the Earth.

   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after
the war, some means would have to be available to project
military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against
Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the
beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar
military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A
minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based
in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the
reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the
Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in
existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built
and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no
small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was
essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.
The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and
naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the
secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear
attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered
prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.

   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection
against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all
these plans were still in the early stages of development, the
answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to
Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden
naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs
which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is
a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off
with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water
a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.

   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided
that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the
Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of
candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered
coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas
were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.
Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the
equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too
many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy
impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for
the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.

   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were
selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was
selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71
three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme
importance in the coming war.

   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand
naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located
close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South
Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes
down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the
installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,
which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island
facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.

   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since
World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even
closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location
is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep
under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also
too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New
Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South
Pacific.

   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.
That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located
perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The
tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret
installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.
It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of
New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island
was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the
northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from
the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain
took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.
Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia
Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.

   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New
Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.
The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build
other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD
installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these
techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve
construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.
In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in
appearance both during and after construction.

   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let
ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well
camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the
entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When
sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you
know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction
projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying
around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house
the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and
debris was disposed of at sea.

   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be
outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake
disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed
greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal
role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara
presided over the public paring back of America's visible
military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling
of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that
shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,
was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in
New Zealand and South Georgia Island!

   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication
facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and
built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two
ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is
an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true
in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing
techniques.

   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret
installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of
certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear
powered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;
and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin
was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and
for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been
financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we
constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three
carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft
whose manufacture was financed the same way!

   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are
all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the
secret naval ships possess one key difference.

   Last month I revealed that the so-called "Stealth Program" has
succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility
shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance
by distorting light waves in its vicinity.

   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into
crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of
the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been
outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth
principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes
because there is more room for the powerful equipment that
generates the field.

   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American
Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on
earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world
domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my
friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United
States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in
control, and they are bent on war.

   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is
being called the "Falklands crisis."

Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described
"PROJECT Z", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR
WAR ONE.

   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here
are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in
Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike
the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war
with Russia.

   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in
certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable
war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in
stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United
States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand
strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially
their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and
rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it
will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks
themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.

   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two
months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for
nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is
fast running out.

   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward
war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in
this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are
equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the
Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the
new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two
mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in
certain ways.

   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a
limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between
the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting
between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning
point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,
and is responsible for the so-called "Falkland crisis" now
dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new
relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far
short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be
settled between them, but for the time being they have called a
truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly
enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.

   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to
slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.
If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller
cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last
summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war
timetable will also give more breathing space for additional
anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.

   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February
that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very
quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect
fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.

   The exact details of the "PROJECT Z" war plan are not known to
either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines
are known to be as I described last month.

   It was decided that military action should be devised that
would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the
Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the
Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working
together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to
devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.
The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these
bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to
attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine
provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.

   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both
secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be
attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the
Bolshevik war plan still workable.

   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault
on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was
no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force
which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside
world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the
very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.

   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different
matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was
also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected
the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military
assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her
long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.

   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has
dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives
were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government
military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland
Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to
enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine
generals were not told everything about the situation by any
means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to
do.

   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were
promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the
shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine
hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military
assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the
troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller
cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With
these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,
the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.

   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack
plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,
landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia
Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old
buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they
also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,
always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as
expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship "Endurance" put 22
Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down
the Argentine flag.

   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine
Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a
boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that
South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered
that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now
came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from
Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.

   During late March, Argentine military forces started
assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  "Nothing new",
thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out
threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed
that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine
forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this
time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine
public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims
to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next
day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia
Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance
initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of
view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were
overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13
alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint
Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.

   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine
forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.
Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the
team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the
cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was
set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian
members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,
April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what
was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under
attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint
Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the
mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a
matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling
of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next
step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a
weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it
would be a nerve gas.

   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the
British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be
described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the
so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik
controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, "Me, too"
any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against
Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war
plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective
countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered
that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.

   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval
armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of
the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding
around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling
would break through into the roof of the naval base in about
three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South
Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The
forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend
themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships
were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to
sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with
tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance
doors would be suicide.

   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was
seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.
The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He
was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the
Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack
preparations.

   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other
secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.
The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on "Red
Alert."  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin
base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at
sea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) major
ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the
nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.

   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,
Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was
alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.
Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from
certain officials.  He got them!

   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories
about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while
negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.
The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as
possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived
in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The
official stories about "slow movement" of the British armada were
intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,
the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,
then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the
announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South
Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.

   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British
fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two
weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint
Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it
was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a
shambles of the plan.

   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent
left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was
announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into
trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on
a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on
South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and
combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In
moments the ship was without any command, its communications and
radar silenced.  Then a Russian "sub" closed in and quickly
finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke
apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is
known, there were no survivors.

   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two
results, both important:

First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic
by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a
configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost
valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the
progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for
arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching
out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint
commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.

The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was
flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible
action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting
involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could
be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the
seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in
southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational
headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast
of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to
provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible
to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I
explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the
Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded
communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes
headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South
Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of
South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the
South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint
Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been
flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in
New Zealand!

   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by
other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out
of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos
Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he
was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top
Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have
revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did
not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four
days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded
his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, "Time is running out."
And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.

   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the
hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military
analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed
until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was
still out of range.

   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the
long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was
detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the
effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed
everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the
bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside
sufficiently to badly disable them.

   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging
on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands
awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to
the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect
against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the
tactics which the Russians employed.

   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships
using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.
As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which
PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations
of the ships to the attack submarines.  The "subs" were armed
with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to
explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been
thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective
shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right
through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.
Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik
Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went
their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from
around the world.

   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local
time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.
That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public
with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was
wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught
always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning
from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian
military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret
Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,
bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific
fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By
working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won
the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.

Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression
that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real
war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are
watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That
aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been
promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.

   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing
for a public announcement that the United States will side with
Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat
up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to
fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be
explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the
Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and
tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.

   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now
concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On
all sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freeze
movement."  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all
kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent
months, there have even been referenda popping up on election
ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are
banding together to warn the public about what would happen if
there were a nuclear war.

   We are being told that all this is just popping up
spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and
nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet
now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have
spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you
believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,
and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and
money--and plenty of it.

   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations
machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller
cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it
does, they will lose everything because they are not in a
position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the
Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is
a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in
its power to prevent a nuclear war.

   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller
cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them
and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does
not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity
right now for the Rockefellers.

   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and
they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with
the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of
the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear
war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of
reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.

   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective
with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is
renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old
dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly
provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar
campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan
Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.
The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on
that latent fear as a tool of power.

   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands
crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller
propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that
surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new
super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the
bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new
organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working
name, though this may be changed, is the "World Nonproliferation
Council."  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of
nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be
to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.

                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY

   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO
LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called
Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret
Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern
Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the
Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down
the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the
results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal
Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea
may well be at hand.

   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our
United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They
differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we
are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the
power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture
tells us, our Lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; but
of power, of love, and of a sound mind."  We must learn to wage
peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, "Blessed are the
peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."

   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,
and may God bless each and every one of you.

If the free market places an attractive price on the screwing in of a

most certainly get screwed in -- and most promptly at that, too.

Insofar as several "liberal" jurisdictions are concerned, the essential
elements of rape are gender neutral. Nonetheless, I decided to provide
a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law
Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful
sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful
knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model
Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners
of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures)
defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife
is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of
imminent death.... (MPC @213.1(1)(a))

Indeed the following jurisdictions/states have statutes similar to the MPC:

Alabama-- Code of Ala. @13A-6-61 (1992)
Arkansas--Ark.Stat.Ann. @5-14-103 (1993)
District of Columbia--D.C. Code @22-2801 (1992)
Georgia--O.F.G.A. @16-6-1 (1992)
Idaho--Idaho Code @18-6101 (1992)

                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS

                           Canada Place
                   Vancouver, British Columbia



2:46 P.M. PDT


	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you
could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll
give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)

	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the
Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government
money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the
government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going
to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian
businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What
are the priorities, because there are several association of
Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to
participate in setting up priorities for investment?

	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know
that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls
say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times
published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;
42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent
if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to
sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not
very enthusiastic?  Thank you.

	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going
to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the
answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be
good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will
be used to support the privatization of existing public
enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the
Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have
some influence over the distribution of.

	     With regard to your second question, let me say that
I would think that there would be people in both countries who
would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government
giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to
that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That
is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole
history of America, any kind of aid program has always been
unpopular.

	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is
this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that
this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --
trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments
because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in
Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies
going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the
economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and
investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on
our side and on the Russian side.

	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an
investment for the United States.  This is very much in the
interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the
second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next
week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for
the taxpayers and workers of my country.

	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some
partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share
her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not
what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful
investment.

	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than
the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier
of the Cold War.

	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very
much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory
of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American
President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind
of a very measured breakthrough.

	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory
remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief
that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you
tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to
what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification
of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how
confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager
to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions
inherited from the Cold War?

	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of
Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent
states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States
develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing
that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of
the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for
Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out
on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed
off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and
we agreed to continue to press that.

	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to
reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the
Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the
United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,
but that, in order to do what we need to do together to
strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States
be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join
the NPT regime is critical.

	     What was the second question?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and
COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,
as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other
restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on
relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies
of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of
them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the
leadership of the Congress.

	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be
an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there
are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to
emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there
is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed
to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be
much less.

	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing
more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my
own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement
out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to
begin it in the fairly near future.

	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in
Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely
different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not
political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of
Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the
difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the
difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of
Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the
last part of your speech?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to
compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say
what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a
boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the
music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been
thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music
for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know
as much as I could about your history.

	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then
the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last
presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone
in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.
Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day
when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a
personal feeling about Russia.

	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like
music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a
musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York
Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony
to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically
so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it
occurred.

	     These are things that have always had a big impact
on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever
had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two
countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)

	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.
	First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike
bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that
cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are
afraid to be associated with something negative.

On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is
because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is
going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.
If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might
all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people
for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had
conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any
better/worse than the whites did.
	The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of
the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done
(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the
present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do
any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped
hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.
	My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change
them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle
anything anyway.

That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because
they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and
after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make
you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only
a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not
to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care
how you appear (ie. a Winner).

	If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


 10:10 A.M. EDT

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon
to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out
the first pitch.

	     Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not
Amtrack.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's
going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.

	     Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to
break the logjam with  ??? Senate?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point
that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs
to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for
summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the
important programs that will put people back to work right away this
summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be
passed.

	     Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and
Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President
believes his jobs program should go forward.

	     Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8
billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise
being offered by --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being
offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right
now, let's see what happens today.

	     Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the
Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per
year?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his
program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to
come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's
see what happens.

	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order
to get a vote?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more
intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in
doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the
President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,
real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no
question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative
activity over the last few days.

	     Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package
through?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.

	     Q	     prepared to compromise --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting
with Senator Dole.

	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.

	     Q	  How?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record
time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by
$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for
important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong
passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock
and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that
he is not succeeding overall.

	     Q	  He can't beat this, can he?

	     Q	  The fact is they can do that?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop
action.  There's no question about that.

	     Q	  What are you going to do about it?

	     Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that
when they say yes they mean no?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete
misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese
were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.

	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when
the Japanese say yes they mean no?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.

	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and
there appears to be --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It
does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of
view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up
but I'm not positive.

	     Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general
observation on Japanese etiquette?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --

	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the
Japanese say yes they mean no."

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean
I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific
comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.

	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual
observation.

	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to
clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President
spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but
I'm not sure exactly how many.

	     Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure
there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is
on.

	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they
may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two
days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.
position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the
Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's
commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a
constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to
hear that.

	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq
for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.
policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary
Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have
reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance
with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.

	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,
Saddam can't stay in office?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with
the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that
we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will
continue to demand it.

	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the
dominant power in the area --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also
spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect
full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping
support of terrorism.

	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in
power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you
base that?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not
complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the
rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding
armaments.

	     Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he
would be out of power?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on
the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make
it more difficult for him to stay in power.

	     Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure
politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical
difference with you that's in good faith?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times
in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the
fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now
seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.

	     Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to
them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had
one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate
Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -
-

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true
that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the
introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate
Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who
have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in
what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is
important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.

	     Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats
alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it
through?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can
frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.
You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going
and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.

	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of
the summer?

	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some
Republicans into your camp?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the
President's intiatives?

	     Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and
could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for
particular votes?  When you have to go through --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and
understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the
President's going to continue to reach out when he can.

	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this
experience?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue
to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,
there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.

	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of
putting their proposals forward.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --

	     Q	     any ideas.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being
defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.

	     Q	     to present them.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean
they get the votes --

	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the
parliamentary rules under which they're playing.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in
support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.

	     Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration
backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?

	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for
Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of
grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at
some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about
anything recently.

	     Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the
President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be
some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the
President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider
something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a
special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around
the California economic situation, including the situation in Los
Angeles.

	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles
by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,
Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD
Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to
California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities
which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to
watch it.

	     Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also
supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball
management.  Does the President have a position on that?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received
correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.
He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in
baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the
President intends to continue to go to the ball game.

	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see
Reverend Jackson while he's out there?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see
them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has
raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,
even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.

	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball
game?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an
informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to
the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the
President read it.

	     Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the
managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be
there, and is he going to meet with the President?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.

	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a
lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice
President Gore.

	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,
yes.

	     Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did
warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist
activities?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,
I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been
general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a
long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I
mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.
The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.

	     Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,
apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,
forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at
the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in
their attempts to get some kind of action.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate
action.  But there was no specific information on this specific
operation at all.

	     Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in
not pursuing some kind of --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.

	     Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing
mention in the news conference yesterday --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your
question.

	     Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted
action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what
does the U.S. do next?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going
to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an
agreement.

	     Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an
option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any
time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When
does no mean no and you have to do something different?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something
different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the
U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to
try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.

	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something
that is under consideration.

	     Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's
condition, how he's doing?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.

	     Q	  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think
we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning
after the Mubarak visit.

	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.

	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with
the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their
delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the
next several weeks.

	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude
of the one announced Sunday?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the
magnitude.

	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where
do you stand on that --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,
he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week
and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this
week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a
hard look at it.

	     Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White
House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the
congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll
be able to get our own researchers working as well.

	     Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a
probability than a possibility?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under
discussion.

	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter
of time and -- for months before that happens.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's
something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working
with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll
continue to review other matters.

	     Q	  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule
this week?  Any travel?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I
don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right
now.

	     Q	  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish
American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference
of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National
Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.
We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate
discussions.

	     Thanks.

____________________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                                  April 5, 1993

                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
        EN ROUTE TO CAMDEN YARDS FOR ORIOLES OPENING DAY GAME

                              MARC Train
                       En Route to Camden Yards



11:45 A.M. EDT

	     Q	  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's
protest today?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.
I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,
which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase
minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we
should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.
And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's
a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an
informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to
the game.  So, I think it's good.

	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first
step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an
issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to
give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will
highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.

	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate
on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break
that and get cloture?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I
mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one
of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you
know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate
the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not
like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they
can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a
lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote
for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political
pressure not to do it.

	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when
no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an
economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're
willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston
and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very
sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in
a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans
had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the
program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots
level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they
have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep
Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Why all the quote marks, Roy?  I can see that they might be appropriate where
there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context,
or that they have been appropriated Newspeak-style, but, reading your comments above,
one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that "child abuse",
"forced" sexual activity, and "damage" caused by this is non-existant or
greatly overblown.

"Positive experiences", indeed!

Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means
third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting
a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at
21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are
wrong.

By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was
terribly upset about this.

I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
doesn't have a grain of truth to it.

Perhaps, though the exclusion of the Gay Perotistas in the

clue in this regard.  Dozens of examples?  I don't know...

Thank you for correcting the error in my post to the net.
This information came from a newspaper article that was
fuzzy in my mind.  I can only wonder if there have been
similar outcries about NAMBLA's presence in the parades
of New York and Boston.

And I was pointing out that legal precedent defines a human being as

There is a confusion here about what "bodily resources" constitutes.  Blood
transfusions and organ donations involve bodily resources; your examples
do not.

OK, I should have said "former" enemy.  I was being sarcastic about what

Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a
gun?

Have you considered a non-interventionist policy?  If market reform does
happen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to
help their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same
reason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably
consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help
them.

Then their's the ideological point.  We want to "win" Russia over to
our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit
over everyone's finances?

It seems instead of gridlock on any scale, we have aid to Russia,
expensive space programs, national charity that doesn't help the poor,
and probably, studies of drunken goldfish.  I think *limited* government
is more key than how democratic it is.

If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should
be VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money would
your fellow Russia-aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose
weren't using the same government machine to steal money from you

   An addition to anti-discrimination laws which includes homo and bisexuality
? One would assume it would be because politicians were listening to the people
coming up with rational arguments rather than variations on bigotry. Logic
sometimes prevails.
   BTW, glad to see that you've admitted sexual attraction to children is a
seperate sexual orientation. Didn't think you had that much honesty.

But you still get into trouble. For example - how often are crimes
of violence not "hate crimes"? The question is then who are you
hating? If its another gang member, then its better than if
the person you hate is of a differnt color?

Also, is it realistic to declare that crimes of hate are worse
than crimes of gross negligence? (Like random drive by shootings
where they can't be hate crimes because the shooter doesn't know
who he is going to hit - he just shoots into the crowd).

First, I heard today that there is a good chance that the U.S. instead
of New York is going after the bombers. This means no capital punishment.

Secondly, double jepardy does help keep the government from going after
you for first one murder, then the next, etc. A "sovereign" has essentially
one chance with a single fact pattern (such as the World Trade Center bombing).
That is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the
deaths, as well as the property damages, as well as conspiracy, at once.
Of course, as we discovered in the Rodney King case, there are two
"sovereigns", neither of which can try you twice for the same crime.

Why don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes?
Blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal
system, blacks would be disproportionately represented.

(Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.  It's probably
an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks
are more likely to be poor.  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities
in prison is to increase the wealth of minorities.)

{Interesting that you would respond "emotionally" in defense of the
government. Maybe there is a beating heart there.}

For the record though, the biggest-baddest goverment on earth claims
the most sovereignty over man. Best I can tell God allows anyone to
go to hell who wants to. Omnipotency logically determines that "allowing"
and "sending" mean the same thing.  (Mere human concepts of course.)

So come on WDS. Why bother to try some flimsy facade of logic. Waco
proves it's not needed -- the demonstration that government can walk
over it's own rules in the name of justice has been made. No problem
by me. Noted and announced -- for the record. Just giving the govern-
ment it's due, and getting back to more worthwhile non-government
concerns.

                  Office of the Press Secretary
                 (Vancouver, British Columbia)
______________________________________________________________


                       BACKGROUND BRIEFING
                               BY
                 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS


                          April 4, 1993

                          Canada Place
                  Vancouver, British Columbia


9:40 A.M. PST


	     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING
on the aid package.

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The
President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed
yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic
and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.

	     Before taking your questions and running through the
basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.
First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do
with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds
have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is
no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund
any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently
are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin
tomorrow.

	     The second point is that this package is designed to
support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package
are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have
been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian
government.

	     Third, the President is determined that we will
deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed
to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we
wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we
feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in
front of you.

	     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of
trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's
capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend
well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of
governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do
so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make
trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.

	     They also agreed that there would be a new joint
commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by
Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister
Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through
the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote
a vastly expanded relationship.

	     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down
the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just
give you some general background on what these programs are.
I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.

	     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food
and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has
been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian
grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure
there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the
major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food
for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also
be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and
pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.

	     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you
know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship
with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia
that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the
Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.
The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are
concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,
but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on
principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates
thereafter for the life of the deal.

	     The third program is a collection of private sector
support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're
going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses
is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.
And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American
enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the
goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in
Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.

	     The President has also decided to create a
privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian
government in its priority objective of trying to convert state
enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has
also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a
Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by
prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.

	     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary
page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that
this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of
pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total
of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed
tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're
launching.

	     The President is also calling for the development of
a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to
try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public
efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in
Russia.

	     The fifth program you see is Russian office of
resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and
conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration
project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military
to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic
states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to
make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's
with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American
construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration
basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working
very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say
that we have a long-term commitment to this project.

	     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They
are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our
initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the
possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and
gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in
the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much
environmental damage.

	     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,
about the new group being created that the Vice President will
chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing
with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development
committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,
to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede
trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time
investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this
problem full-time.

	     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and
investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an
analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we
just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a
commitment within our own government to have people work on it --
senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly
important.

	     You'll notice that the United States is going to
support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer
status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested
our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the
long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is
paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are
supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting
their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.

	     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in
credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended
$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil
project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an
agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion
framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance
Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.
We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll
get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo
conference, the G-7 conference.

	     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to
defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance
objectives with you.

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major
unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts
in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and
secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory
under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.
Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important
agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding
to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130
million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement
program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for
bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.

	     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for
the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed
from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially
contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the
construction of that storage facility.

	     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help
in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear
materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we
add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance
which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall
safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety
measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the
last couple of years.

	     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more
work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,
and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last
couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for
safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian
territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of
START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.

	     So we are working very hard with all the parties to
the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with
them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia
as a very important step in that process.

	     Q	  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in
Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with
Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the
same one, why do you feel it's necessary?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same
deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil
field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights
oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced
today.  So it's completely new.

	     Q	  Can you tell us more about what's involved?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like
other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do
two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west
Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating
oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.
The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the
natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which
will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what
Russia needs.

	     So we think this deal is very, very good development
for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an
American company.  And the American government has played a
leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility
in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.

	     Q	  So it's to search and also to renovate fields
that are already there?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.

	     Q	  On that point, should other American companies
expect to get administration support for such deals, or should
they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2
billion?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,
Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the
U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department
and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we
think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,
there will be $2 billion in financing available for American
companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.

	     Q	  That should take up all of the rest of the
deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be
support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a
tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas
companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and
gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will
soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may
even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.

	     Q	  What's the current year budget costs of that
$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any
current year budget costs --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer
you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.

	     Q	  The concessional food sales -- is there any
current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in
which the payments are due?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional
food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.
USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to
expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd
refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.

	     Q	  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?

	     Q	     and the private sector -- how many folks are
going to be involved in that?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start
with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt
coming into office that there were literally thousands of
organization, private organizations in the United States that in
one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve
democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.
And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that
had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the
administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try
to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give
some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the
efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.

	     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will
soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in
the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might
use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of
our own government, but the resources of the American private
sector and schools and communities across the nation.

	     Q	     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word
yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated
besides the $300 million the President talked about?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration
is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What
the President has done this weekend is to consult really
intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional
measures the United States could take in some of these areas to
support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he
returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other
ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.

	     Q	  Two questions about the $700 billion
agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of
consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.
So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you
explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans
for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit
into that situation?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the
United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains
and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think
between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history
here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through
the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle
to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of
last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on
that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and
therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that
program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and
other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we
could promote American grain sales.

	     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've
announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the
Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient
authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked
for a concessional loan program.

	     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a
short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but
a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what
this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are
worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of
principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the
life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of
interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we
believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal
for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments
and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this
very important grain relationship, which is important for them,
and it's important for the American farm community.

	     Q	  I gather from what you say that this could make
it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC
loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,
is that right?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit
about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing
the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program
because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you
know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around
$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having
taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American
market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to
respond to a specific request from the Russian government for
major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the
grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,
we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to
great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with
the Russian government and arrived at this solution.

	     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides
them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on
the short-term payments.

	     Q	  Where do those funds actually come from?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the
Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's
authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do
not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want
to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,
the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been
allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration
can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very
important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,
that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be
able to do so.

	     Q	  How did you arrive at the figure of $700
million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually
have a range from 0 to --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason
for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us
that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and
harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the
shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the
harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the
same level of food imports from the West.

	     Q	  I would imagine there's going to be some
considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other
republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.
Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for
the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with
some of the other republics?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very
conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending
American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet
Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the
area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that
you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and
roughly 50 percent to the other countries.

	     In the area of food sales, we have been active with
Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We
will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this
summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the
other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are
productive and they're hard-hitting.

	     Q	  Has anything happened at the summit to lead
American energy companies and other companies to believe that
Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of
taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our
primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not
only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd
like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're
convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to
support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of
Western governments have the financial resources over the next
decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private
sector can do that.

	     We look at our own society and we see tremendous
capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very
good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial
investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new
technology and new capital to finance new production.

	     That's what the Russian government has told us it
wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis
on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on
the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently
last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President
Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong
signal to the American business community that we support their
efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-
Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to
support them.

	     Q	  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to
deliver on making Russia a more --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I
would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.
Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas
sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice
President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the
barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil
and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that
committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to
the work.

	     Q	  What type of mechanism is already in place to
administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will
the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of
the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the
Russian government for distribution at their will?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking
about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the
program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working
through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure
that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to
the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the
Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can
account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of
months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of
these programs.

	     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in
the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it
is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of
the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working
through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the
housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,
we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the
democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian
private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with
journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have
noticed.

	     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different
activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be
carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the
Russian government, some with Russian citizens.

	     Q	  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and
on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the
President has to do on that?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George
noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in
the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's
fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we
return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and
we'll get back to the Russian government.

	     Q	  You were not prepared for these questions when
you got here?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared
for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not
prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --
let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require
consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with
the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those
concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before
we take any action.

	     Q	  Is this package designed so that you will not
have to go to Congress for anything at this point?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the
beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all
the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.
So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to
seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In
effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the
agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And
that's the advantage of this particular initiative.

	     Q	  If this, as the President says, is a long-term,
long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment
heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to
Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are
prepared to go to Congress for various things?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been
clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with
President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American
funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a
major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by
Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that
delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.
And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where
it stands now.

	     Q	  We've been told repeatedly that a number of
these items represent different or new ways of spending the money
already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these
items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways
that it was not previously set to be?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've
said that these are all projects that either Congress had
allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were
some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this
administration took office and had some new ideas about how the
funds might be expended.

	     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or
the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --
Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to
further our programs.

	     And example of that is the Food for Progress
concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of
funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we
looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American
market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we
found it.

	     Q	  Where, for example, are you getting the money
for this Russian officer resettlement --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the
Freedom Support Act funds.

	     Q	  In other words, all of the money is being
directly spent in new ways, so to speak --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant
projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the
second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if
you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that
total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act
funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year
'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the
legislative history of those funds.

	     Q	     cooperation --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I
don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.

	     Q	  Could you tell us please, has anything happened
here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and
Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's
happened here --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,
President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this
issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security
and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's
session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly
reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been
talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple
of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the
discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very
important negotiation that's been going on essentially between
Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially
discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute
to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.

	     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,
I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.

	     Q?	    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is
any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current
year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been
earmarked and put it into this fund?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and
mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We
could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included
out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to
many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the
privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already
talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.

	     We could have put in really big numbers and this
could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:
This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're
going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President
feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy
that the western governments, the combination of governments, put
up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not
able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is
determined, to carry out every single program in this package.
And we'll do it.

	     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's
part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking
for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively
support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment
on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.

	     Q	     taken it way from any --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.
Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;
so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in
Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.

	     Q	  In terms of funding, there is no available
monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money
somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I
don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the
example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit
guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay
back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt
problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we
looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement
for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and
also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers
have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply
look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative
authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other
areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,
but we thought we should now.

	     Q	  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package
for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by
initiatives put forward by President Bush?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think
that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were
appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This
administration took office and inherited some obligations that
the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven
week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments
that had been made by the previous administration.

	     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the
enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not
been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to
it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them
into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,
is another Clinton initiative.

	     Further, we listened to the Russian government and
listened to the Russian military who told us that the
resettlement of their officers was important to them for
political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton
has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment
that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out
a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.

	     I would also say that the President has given
impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly
about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we
have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends
itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the
creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,
we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private
sector as well as the American government, to achieve that
objective.

	     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And
as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the
last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last
administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton
assistance package for Russia.

	     Q	  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the
past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this
outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money
will not just disappear because it's being administered by the
Russian government?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I
know that the President and other senior officials of our
government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and
that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's
intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the
State Department will take great care in making sure that the
funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their
source.

	     I would not that this package is not simply a
package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of
these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are
going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,
with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another
example of that.

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add
a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one
area that we've been looking at very, very closely is
consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting
for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,
of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime
contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of
a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that
funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in
Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent
efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.

	     Q	  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly
when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President
is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think
it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over
the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties
on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over
the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach
out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us
to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said
that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate
in a much more effective way the activities of our own
government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in
Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw
them together and to focus their efforts.

	     Q	  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will
actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any
figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something
up in the next couple of days on that.

	     Q	  This figure is larger than the figure that has
been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result
of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --
unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and
I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put
us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was
briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the
intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of
the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we
had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have
been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week
going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in
Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.
And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been
together for about two weeks.

	     Q	  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There
was so much talk before about the President wanted to get
Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.
Is that in the out years?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.
President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,
that support for the creation of private businesses is important
to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is
important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize
the state industries is important to them.

	     And so what we did was to try to make those the
centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We
listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been
working with the Russian government for months on this trying to
work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of
these programs was involved every step of the way.

	     But let me get at the other part of your question.
The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader
set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking
for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the
table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in
housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to
consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other
allied governments that are also active.

	     Q	  There's essentially nothing that happened in
the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that
you came in with?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular
package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks
ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on
the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've
primarily talked about future, about what more the United States
and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,
which is our base objective here.

	     Q	  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated
to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me
what about job training for workers who are displaced by
privatization?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we
have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and
financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing
initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain
Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.

	     Q	     money for job training for workers whose
jobs are disappearing because of privatization --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet
allocated any money for that.

	     Q	  Why not?

	     Q	     of the $6 million is going to build 450
housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the
Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do
housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework
of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've
got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think
about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also
retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming
out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.
We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers
as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian
government.

	     Q	     of the $6 million will go to retrain --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.

	     Q	  Are you talking about apartment buildings or
single --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about
single, individual dwellings.

	     Q	  You're saying that only 450 families will be
served by this?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I
thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.
What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the
Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building
housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with
a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next
couple of months and try to figure out with American
organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job
done.

	     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.
And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into
this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to
spend the money wisely.

	     Q	  What is it about this program that convinces
you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be
in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,
especially considering their other debt problem?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think
it's important to note that the United States on its own does not
have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.
It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to
our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what
the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We
can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do
so, which is consistent with our national interests.

	     Q	  Did the President say that the value of the
U.S. contribution was that it would create security and
prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this
program that does this?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to
go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,
and that is we want to do everything we can to support the
continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay
in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear
forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,
which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in
Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that
this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we
have to make a long-term commitment to it.

	     Q	  And then on the question of Russia's ability to
repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15
years from now?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian
government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping
is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve
their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency
revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years
from now to pay back those loans.

	     Q	     substantial government-to-government loan
we've ever gotten into with the Russians?

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to
answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years
on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because
the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to
just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of
effort.

	     Q	     government loans in any other sector that
you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair
to say this is a new and unique effort.

Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the
details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls
were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds
did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush
and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced
Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush
"consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
increases.

As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps
on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as
President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
increases).

The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level
ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.

Chew on that awhile.

   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling
himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first
in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term
but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations
are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the
eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar
Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the
Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is
synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who
originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans
and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word
by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is
nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim
to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-
shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.

  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In
search of the Indo-Europeans" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.
The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature
as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and
for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible
things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have
no clear claim.

If a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will
do it again and it may be funny. Then they may repeat it over and over
again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any
more. Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing
the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.

Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does not
make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule
their target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put
on a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the
spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the
user couldn't think of anything original to say.


In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner
guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns. Ed is clearly one
of this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent.

Note that the laws that don't agree with you were passed to protect
a class of people who couldn't get justice from the state courts;
specifically civil rights workers in Missisippi in the 60's. The
federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance
of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well

As Anatole France said; "The law in its impartial majesty forbids the
rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges."

Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example
the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not
punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have
a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define
equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance
for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed
toward poorer people.

In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal
protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a
motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its
impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.
I'm sure that's a great relief to Douglas Meier.

To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,
but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject
the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could
be "Is a polydactyl person a human being?"  You still have not
answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.

You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.
If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,
provide it for me.

More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does
not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,
brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant
difference.

What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,
changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,
why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations, e.g. "It really doesn't matter to you..."
If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek
some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words.

As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy
fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.
A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?

You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on
for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.
But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The
systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.

Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total
failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in
reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,
that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,
you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than
a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,
there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to
its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?

You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.

Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and
it is not as slow as you seem to think.

Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that
he was murdered by a religious, "pro-life" fanatic.  Please do

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?
Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What
is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a
healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as
she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at
parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and
the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.

Cite one of these conflicting statutes.  You keep making
these assertions, but you haven't supported any of them yet.
I am speaking of statutes that conflict with the definition
Larry posted.

Why did you delete the code that Larry posted?

Also, the Model Penal Code made perfect sense to me.  Were you,
perhaps, confused by it?

Also, I am still looking for your definition.  The one you used
clearly indicates that a fetus is not a human being.

Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit
your needs.  The principle of protecting life is abandoned based
on "action versus inaction."  Not much of a principle.  Suddenly
you recognize that the claim on bodily resources is dependent
on circumstances other than this principle of life.  That's
a very conevnient principle you have there, Matt.

Yes because it has always had that power. The constitution limits the areas
in which the government can exercise power. The constitution can be changed
however and has been frequently. For example during prohibition the
government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state had
the capacity to change the constitution to enable this.

The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictate
the manner in which power is exercised. No piece of paper can prevent
abuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidate
for opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,

The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful arms
control measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who could
prevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the power
of the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. This
is the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern because
the people with the guns think that they have the right to decide the
law.

The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is which
date from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countries
were much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN - organisations
where individual members had significant powers in their own right and
did not derive their power from a central authority.

|>arbitration business.

But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rules
and regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state
was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectively
made in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which is
a non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so however
within the framework laid down by the government.

In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. If
you were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw the
monarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very short
time. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit Royal
Charters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required
authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authority
to be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case of
misbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to remove
privillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently established
through a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favours
without recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolish
the house of lords for example.

Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the
"common law" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is law
made by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else is
common law.


Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. For
example a judgment in common law made in England can effect the
interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once in
the Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example a
lot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevance
to UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning that
lies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus if
a judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law in
one jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with no
guiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime which
they might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The law
should be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions without
precedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is
superior in UK law.

     In case you missed it on the news....the first 16 Haitians
of many that tested positive for HIV and were being held on a
base in Cuba have been flown to the U.S.
     Further a U.S. judge has ruled that they must receive
medical treatment or be returned to a place where they could
receive same.

      So guess what folks, we taxpayers get to pick up the tab
(just as you might have expected) for people who have never
contributed a dime to the U.S. society.

      I think this government has its priorities ALL SCREWED UP.
If they want to help Haitians....how about removing the illegal
government, how about giving them development aid?
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE to waste resources on dying non-citizens
who will never be productive in either this country or their own.
It does not make sense when the same resources applied or even
just plain given to poor people in Haiti could significantly
help 100 people in Haiti per 1 AIDS-infected non-citizen immigrant.

He is claiming that what the Indonesians are up to in East Timor is genocide.

Certainly what is going on is serious enough that it is way above the threshold
where it should be brought to attention. Pol Pot did not kill nearly as many
people as Hitler but he is most certainly as evil.

He fully accepts the differences in the intentions and situations. What he
is saying is that the effect in both cases has been mass murder only we
only get to hear about the one that supports the red scare merchants and the
behaviour of our allies is conveniently ignored.

A starker comparison is in El Salvador where the allegations that the left
were repeatedly making throughout the 1980s have been proven with the
discovery of mass graves. There was evidence enough at the time that Duarte
and his gang of thugs were mass murderers but Regan and Bush ignored it
and gave them arms to repress the opposition. This must be contrasted with
the events in Nica<ragua where no evidence of Sandinista attrocities such
as mass murder of political opponents has come to light since they lost
the democratic elections that they held. Despite this the Nicaraguan regime
was held to justify the funding of a terrorist war fought mainly against
civillians by the infamous contras.

In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and
(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand? :-)

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which
allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about
classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question
from scratch.

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.

Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus
crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.
This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
"contribution to society."  I view that doctrine as being both (a)
personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the 14th Amendment.

Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

And when controlled for usage of oil, gas, etc. energy efficiency in
all countries turns out to be identical :-)

To take population density as an example, one way to reduce energy
used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in
dense urban areas (though this might, of course, have other
disadvantages, possibly even relating to energy use).  The fact that
Japan is forced to do this by the nature of the country, while the US
is not, does not mean that people in the US would be unable to do this
if given sufficient motive to conserve energy.

Both events took place, but not as you described them. It feels trivial to
nit-pick about details like this, and insulting to everyone involved.
But I feel that the truth is more damning than an exaggeration, and
much more likely to cause people to think when they read it.

In general, when I read an argument that uses inaccurate and inflamatory
statements (honest mistake or not), I tend to dismiss the entire argument
because of those errors.

The entire situation in the Middle East is too important to reduce to
back-and-forth propaganda -- it is precisely this reduction that further
polarizes the situation and makes peace, understanding, and reconcilliation
impossible.

it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriate
board but along with all of the so called great things the white male has done they have also contributed to society by means of mass genocide, the theft of
ideas and cultures, creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities.
but every culture has its upside and its downside.  it seems to me that the
white male (must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following - if
you're not disregard) and western culture are the only things that look to
actively classify things as good or bad, worthy or unworthy (ya dig)
it can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the
american indians civilization.  nothing but selfish acts that benefit one
group of people (and not even their women get or got respected or regarded as
equal - ain't that some stuff)

white men - not being specific - but in a lot of cases are just wack or have
wack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose.

just look at david koresh - throughout history (i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance) only white men associate themselves withbeing GOD.  no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a
position.  and then to manipulate and mislead all those people.

hmmm...  i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history
has been written to glorify the exploits of white men you'd only find lies.

Which, considering the amount Bush&congress added to it, would be a
not-inconsiderable achievement.

While we're on the subject, I also believe that the supply-side claim that
reducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in
SocSec taxes, which were *raised* a considerable amount, at the same time that
income taxes were cut.  If you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after
after the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. By then, record
deficits were well entrenched.

	Ok, as far as that goes I agree.  The situatio in E. Timor does deserve
the attention that Bosnia, Angola, etc. get.  But...I also think that the
"press" can't be forced to print articles, air shows about it, etc.
	The religious right got tired of the mainstream media and started
buying their own stations/papers.  The left should do the same thing instead of
relying on NPR and public stations.

	I wouldn't venture that far (to say the situation in E. Timor is
genocide).  The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who
doesn't get in their way: which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do.
Virtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the "killing fields".

	I don't agree.  Right now Australia is the most effective lever against
Indonesia.  They are negotiating for oil drilling rights off Timor, and
stopping that process would go a long way towards making Indonesia realize that
people don't want to see the situation swept under the rug.

	Would you please define "nth derivative of debt"?  Last time I asked
you seem to have disappeared....

	And it's the deficits themselves that came down to 2.9% of GNP.  The
numbers are posted in the previous posting.

	Not in terms of GNP, the one universally accepted measure of deficits
(at least among rigorous economists :)

Carlos,

   Why not check out some of the scientific research that has been
done in this area and convince yourself.

   Research around the world indicates that the issue of coercion is
the critical factor.

For those interested in research on the topic I can suggest, Li et al
(England), Constantine (United States), and Sandfort (The Netherlands).
I especially like Sandfort's research for he actually quotes what the
boys who are involved in the relationships have to say.

If time is really hard, can a bank selectively call in some mortgage
loans early?  What if the bank folds, can its creditors call in the
loans?

...His account that is.

Many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here
on the net on a daily basis.  I have just been informed of what I feel is
one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The
out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people
don't like what he says or thinks.

We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have
not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least
somewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)
in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.
If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,
unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel
an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that
Mr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif
net police, Ted Frank.


PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE.

                      ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?
                      ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?
                        IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?
         HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?

I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!


Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that
you may understand this vial act for what it is...

Well, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and
thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.
I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult
for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my
sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his
defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has
been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed
at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding
via netmail...)

While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin
to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post
I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I
AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him
axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentum
ad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).

The issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?"
Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...

1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken
	*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article
	constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post
	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one
	had posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek",
	would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.
2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
	"proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains
	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and
	behold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had an
	address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!

If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE
ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get
"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they
only get "I don't like what that user is doing because...".
Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.

In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks for
the info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts are
very interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But,
I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted and
and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...")
NWO Indeed!

Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.
I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!
Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post
to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.
Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.
Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I
was just getting started.

It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40
times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?
We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seems
to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does
he work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is well
known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...

And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here
in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the
process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe
a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I
am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY
soon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:

[Editor's Note: The reason for posting the header lines from the bounced
messages was to show what the problem was and hopefully correct it.]

[Ted Frank] It's inexcusable to post 150 lines of bounced mail headers to four
newsgroups.
    A simple four-line post would have been sufficient.

yes i agree. BUT our policy is to not watch everypost someone  here
makes.
we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings
by flaming the user into shape (which i assume this is ment to be).
we (CS operations) don't like to get involved in this stuff (unless
its illegal, repetitive posts of 1gig gifs, harassment, or something
else that offends the community in general). my suggestion is that
you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look
like or tell him to RTFM

OK, I admit I have no hard data on this. Why don't you help me with this?
If you would compile a commented list of all grants, un-repaid loans (if any),
and direct aid, I'd be very interested to see it. If you could give me
references from, for example, Congressional Budget Authorization Hearings,
I could look them up here and I'd be happy to post a verification of your
data.

Otherwise, I'll try my hand at this, but unfortunately I won't have sufficient
time available until the end of this month, so the results would be delayed.

Let me know if you're interested in doing this.

And, as has been noted more times than we care to count, about as
likely to stand up in court as the twenty-seven eight by ten
color glossy pictures the Stockbridge, Mass., police, took for
use as evidence against Arlo Guthrie.  (As anyone who knows
Alice's Restaurant is aware, he pleaded guilty to littering, was
fined $50, and told to pick up the garbage.)

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

   Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation I've posted.
   Teel, it's bad enough you post this bs, it's even worse that you don't
   even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting
   that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
   contrary point to a severely deluded mind.

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the
6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that
these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?)
they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought
one of his deductions.   Defending your deductions seems puny when
you believe that there is no need to file in the first place!

Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the
German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the
largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and
generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective
majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to
the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false
as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January
1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by
Hitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election
for President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg
49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election
in April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.
So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of
German voters.

Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in
Reichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election
the Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of
the 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the
Communists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National
party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million
of the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large
party was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but
I think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.
Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed
Chancellor.

What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for
Hitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to
put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government
for the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and
their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the
interests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a
number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific
objectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the
democratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other
parties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also
out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and
generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.

Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition
for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and
there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.
If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed
to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had
begun to decline.

Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his
second choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After
the November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed
on von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back
and support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,
who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold
together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to
participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of
the Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the
party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,
knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain
power lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country
was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though
the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to
achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition
parties to work together.

Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:

   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their
   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,
   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of
   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their
   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine
   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm
   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.

True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But
that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him
*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to
take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties
(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.
Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see
the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.

This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'.  You are making claims about what

The fact is that Primetime (TM of ABC) has had numberous reposts on such waste

There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs
from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed
that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by
changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).

True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.

Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class
to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not
specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.

Tsk. Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country
just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather
a petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way
to the U.S. Senate, I've noticed...)

While Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. I
couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might
not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for
suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should
be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain
he won't.

If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the
problem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy
and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.

Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his
Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress
and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through
and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the
anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in
hiding.

If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However,

Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting
farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if
we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the
problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.

Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.
There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy
Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to
help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles.
Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to
tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.

Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due
to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform
a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that
even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government
is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be
painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to
help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never
get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.

As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*.
A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.
I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and
society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible
self-sufficient populace.

Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers
do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of
every person on the planet.

There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when
it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of
bounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market
is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of
government.

Wait a minute.  You've been claiming for quite a while now that
pedophilia, according to CA state law, is a sexual orientation.  Now
your position is that the law doesn't specifically exclude it?

You know damn well what's going to happen.  Some guy in a NAMBLA
T-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down,
he's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that
sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or
bisexuality.

Unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual
orientation, you have no business saying so.

There's no "for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will

And that's good enough for the law, Mark. So why do you keep whining that
viability "isn't defined"? What purpose does your whining serve?

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary.
Price controls and government intervention.  The surest route to
disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or
common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have
thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to
dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for
government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what
the are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with
horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.
We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about
how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that
should come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all
of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to
the rescue.  Simply amazing.

Some of the footage shown on "Street Stories" the other night
showed an ATF agent screaming at the cameraman to "get that
camera out of here" while they were in retreat from the "compound".
I think the same person may have also said to "turn the camera off".
Anyway, it was clear from the comments that the safety of the
cameraman wasn't their paramount concern.

If the heading is true, Mr. Frank should be ashamed of himself.

Nothing makes me gag more than people who don't respect the
rights of others to voice their opinions.  My idol Lenny Bruce
once commented about "that asshole Time Magazine" when they
advocated censorship of his material.  Time actually sided
with the cops' and their arresting of Bruce at his shows,
whereby he routinely would say "cocksucker", then the cops
would rush the stage to arrest him.  My, how the times haven't
changed...

I can't help but think of how Lenny would be received in today's
politically correct arena.  Heck, I even support the right of
neo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets.

And before Mr. Frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about
anti-Semitism...I'm Jewish, a longtime member of AIPAC and the JNF,
and have contributed over $1000 apiece to these fine groups.  I'm
a regular contributor to every pro-Israel group I can find, but I
still support the right of people like Arf to speak up and vomit
his propaganda.

I want to know just WHO these people are !!!

I'm basing all this on the assumption that Mr. Frank did indeed
write to some sysadmin requesting Mr. Teel to be admonished.  If
this is not the case, I hereby retract these nasties directed
toward him.  If not, I stand against Mr. Frank and his trashing
of the First Amendment.

Once more around the racetrack. See the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality. I simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or I more moral people. They may make us act in a moral
manner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment. They say nothing about whether we have become more
moral or not. Perhaps the distinction is too fine.

I have the right to live there UNDER the established
government, right?  Exactly.  Thus, the Palestinian Arabs
should be content to live under Israeli rule, but should cease
clamoring for an independent state.  OR, they should get one in
Gaza and, if it can be worked out, part of the West Bank.  This
is what I have proposed all along, Nabil.

Yea, it turned out that Gramm-Rudman was a sham to fool the voters

					^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anyone can expand the economy by chargeing $3 trillion on their credit
cards.   Big deal.  Deficit spending only expands the economy in the short
term.  In the long term it shrinks the economy for numerous reasons. I would
have MUCH preferred that the taxpayers had that $3 trillion instead.

If Reagan had kept his campaign PROMISE to balance the budget by 1983,
there would have been no need for Bush or Clinton to raise taxes.  And
all Reagan had to do was balance that puny Carter deficit.

Chew on that awhile.

------------------------------
Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight
bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody
fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws
that exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is
his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The
national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to
sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights
until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!
The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their
sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights
who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right
to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even
if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go
read your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment
campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail
and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK.

----------------------------------------
This "mutation" as you call it, protects your little butt too, if you
happen to be somewhere where you're the wrong "shade" for somebody else's
taste. If it can be shown that the motive for the assault on you was
racially motivated, then the full power of these extra laws that bring more
charges and punishments will come against those who harmed you. The first
use of such laws was well over a hundred years ago, and constitutional
scholars of all conviction recognize that this right reserved to the
federal government is well established and not just some short-lived
peculiarity, too! Go read some constitutional law for awhile. Maybe you'll
get it.

---------------------------
The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in
order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people
being pissed off at each other. The federal government has an interest in
the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of
civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a
lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically.
It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid
since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was
getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being
part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south
stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally
they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were
expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try
it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under
the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent
as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to
somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did
the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the
president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the
militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the
thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey
or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god,
they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And
the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls
that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need
such an ability in federal jurisdiction.

______________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                             April 13, 1993


                      REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT,
               SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND
                   SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH  IN
                GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING

                     Chamber of Commerce Building
                           Washington, D.C.



8:30 P.M. EDT


	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you
in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking
part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.

	     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas
Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to
mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he
has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all
followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education
here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according
to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational
system.

	     His philosophy of government, his belief in the
importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest
here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us
President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in
the Chamber of Commerce studios.

	     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for
taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite
network and we welcome you here this evening.

	     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.
And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening
also.

	     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure
many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that
you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In
Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.

	     I believe the President has a few words that he might
want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that
at this time.  It's great to have you.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.

	     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob
Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the
Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,
along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine
tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people
from school to the work place.

	     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,
recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this
economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to
work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to
make things happen.

	     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that
kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home
state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart
Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing
several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I
appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all
the rest of you.

	     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward
constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about
this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson
believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in
education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,
freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and
third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.

	     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this
beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful
cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change
with changing times.

	     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit
and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we
can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --
about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless
we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in
government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase
our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the
long run.

	     We also have to have people who can carry their load.
And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven
or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system
and continues into the work force where education must go on for a
lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can
learn.

	     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing
we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership
between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the
private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're
trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that
would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many
thousands that have a strong education component so our young people
can be learning and working at the same time.

	     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good
place we can begin, I think, the discussion.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.

	     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all
citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And
tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours
can prepare students for this world of work.

	     This week, the Education Department and the Labor
Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called
Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.
The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's
proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched
jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged
areas of the country.

	     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it
somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls
for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your
words is that so important?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.
First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may
have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want
them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to
continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of
research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may
forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year
over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for
schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already
taught before.

	     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,
not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to
abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is
learning because we think that the best and most productive workers
will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience
could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to
succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are
disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go
into the next year, is really even greater.

	     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs
throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this
educational component of training.

	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.
Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer
or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with
education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,
for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning
geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or
working on something, and they can see the exact and direct
application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a
lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between
education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.
It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of
young people even beyond the summer.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.

	     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship
program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell
us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it
developing.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why
it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade
will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will
require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people
get in a high school diploma.

	     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries
of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school
education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young
people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not
go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because
they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their
employers.

	     So we think America has a big economic interest in
trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school
but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes
two years of further training either in a community college, a
vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in
this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some
funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states
and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in
a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,
based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could
revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and
the earnings of American workers.

	     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think
you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the
people watching this program -- that the business community and
educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many
of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In
fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The
people watching this program probably are the ones who are most
directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley
and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes
already out there.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight
about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning
career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal
with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of
these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?

	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and
you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much
longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business
community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're
doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The
Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these
kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've
aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.

	     The business community is going to be actively engaged
in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and
helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions
develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.

	     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is
one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these
players in a community come together and work together and cooperate
together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and
the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody
is talking, but they're not really working together in a common
strategy.

	     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,
would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic
excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a
tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to
make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be
eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year
college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're
talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation
skills for on-the-job learning.

	     And again, those are the critical components.  It's
already being done.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one
point based on my personal experience at home -- the business
community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are
the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,
but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort
of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are
going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the
second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and
influence them.  So I think that's very important.

	     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at
the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some
funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make
sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the
quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to
determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of
course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery
program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about
long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.
President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the
communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be
coming forth before too long.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I
were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public
schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that
a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.

	     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals
that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President
Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to
do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in
Congress that will actually define the things that the national
government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the
children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those
goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school
ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school
graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are
confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are
second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,
disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took
them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of
life-long learning in this country.

	     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a
state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector
role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to
introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;
and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job
is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality
that we need to meet.

	     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite
like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.
Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their
money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and
partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really
it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms
of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to
support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform
efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.

	     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to
the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of
course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and
I wonder if you would comment on that.

	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of
our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they
don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system
of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had
national skill standards to which they could aspire and which
employers would understand as a national credential, many of these
young people would actually find that they were much more eligible
for jobs.

	     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other
countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to
college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain
technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If
you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to
develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working
with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private
industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the
kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other
institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go
ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce
Todd of Austin, Texas.

	     Q	  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and
Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We
have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who
have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me
simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with
much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are
very supportive.

	     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our
summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to
have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much
as 3,500 with the federal assistance.

	     Much of the question that we had designed you have
answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But
the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day
would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round
is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal
level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-
round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the
local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's
something that we believe is very important to success in this
effort.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to
answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,
and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.
I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.

	     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can
structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer
program and that will move a lot of these young people back into
schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in
the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to
try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs
to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're
working on that.

	     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the
Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to
build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job
training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give
heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you
asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we
hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being
trained on a year-round basis.

	     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said
a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen
as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people
actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when
they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we
hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and
we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget
cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue
raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be
able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.

	     Bob, do you want to say anything?

	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out
of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,
and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high
school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in
addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of
jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.
It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the
economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything
else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I
think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I
think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or
greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going
to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything
right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000
will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into
next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it
will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working
together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And
then the state, with all the various school districts, a very
important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I
think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that
moving.

	     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.

	     Doctor?

	     Q	  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to
be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school
and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since
its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two
alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages
we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an
extremely effective learning strategy.

	     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are
several principles that are very important in bridging the school and
work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with
practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure
to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect
upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and
lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the
development of high performance competencies.

	     My question, then is:  How can the general education
faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with
transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies
can you suggest to achieve this integration?

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --
and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting
work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next
guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists
in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to
them and we can discuss it later.

	     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one
thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as
clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the
people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more
explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics
is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish
what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is
vocational learning and what is academic learning.

	     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think
we should have a strong component for people who are in the
vocational program.

	     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to
rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and
work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're
important for all students.  It's not just a special group of
students that needs them.

	     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United
States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream
experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and
12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience
and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on
to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they
can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and
career directions.

	     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often
goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-
related work within the classroom, within our schools.

	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's
going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I
think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank
you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and
your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.

                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT

The most recent reason given by the Clinton Administration for
calling for federally funded abortions is that many private
health insurance programs offer coverage for abortion.

RE: Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion.  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder.  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.

                              Sincerely,



My policy number is:

To your state and national representatives:





RE: Abortion and health coverage

Dear


It has recently come to my attention as a result of the current
abortion debate that my health insurance coverage provided by my
employer may include coverage paying for abortions.

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and am
disturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in this
manner.  However, I depend on my employers' provided health
coverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may lose
not only my coverage but even my job.

I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that health
insurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory in
their health insurance program, so that it can be declined, with
an appropriate reduction in premium.

In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in the
health benefit packages between those who would choose to have
abortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that you
include a provision in which the reduction in premium resulting
from the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to the
employee, rather than pocketed by the employer.

This second provision should serve to dissuade employers from
pressuring employees into taking one or the other stand with
regard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.  Your fellow
citizen.

                                   Sincerely,

<*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York
   State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their
   highest court "Supreme Court," "Supreme Judicial Court" or "Supreme
   Court of Appeals," Maryland and New York call theirs simply the
   "Court of Appeals."  To make matters worse, New York also calls its
   _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"...

Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):

Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's
plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to
which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he
defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course
of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the
plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the
plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked
the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.

(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned
their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.
Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)

Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court
ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided
that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In
other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the
power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment
of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is
always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a
private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.

(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if
it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks
like eminent domain...)

Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that
"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the
plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million
dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?

    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....
    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to
    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose
    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under
    extortion statutes.")

How do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the right
to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns
and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of
demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see
it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of
owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to
stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price
they wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says
that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.

You go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- the
plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,
because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to
having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less
than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."

If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from
other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those
other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice
between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,
shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_
business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_
the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was
Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type
of plant they did where and when they did.)

And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the
plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."
As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."
They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners
of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price
acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made
whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?
(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were
supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)

(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my
school.

(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for
their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first
encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal
opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get
into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick
and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional
Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly
and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously
intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly
biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors
tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is
especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are
practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_
educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat
cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)

I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons
I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can
only call "economic correctness" over justice.

(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged
right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid
losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and
the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to
not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who
own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.
(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other
branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take
other people's property by eminent domain.)

I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to
as "law and economics" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical
analysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use to
help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by
the scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by
_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics
of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.

Jobs?  What the hell have jobs to do with it?  It's another touchy-feely
program from the new, vapid administration.  The fact is, the major claim
made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" --
has absolutely no validity.  Several states already have U.I. programs, have
had these programs for _years_. The result: on average, their success rates
are no better than the national average.  It seems that the gummint hasn't
yet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in.  Yet another case
of shameless demagoguery from the "new" Democrats, the "agents of change."

	In the hopes of adding a little life to, what seems to be, the
same old debates, I would like to add a few bits of info and ask for
comments.

1) A couple days ago the headlines were splashed with stories of proof
   that the North Vietnamese had held U.S. hostages after the war ended.
	Way back in today's newspaper (Page A7 of San Francisco Chronicle)
   there is an article about the document that held the proof.
	[used without permission]

	"The document, which was discovered in the archives of the Soviet
    Communist Party in Moscow, is a Russian translation of what is described
    as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by General
    Tran Van Quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the
    North Vietnamese army."
         [later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205
           Americans in North Vietnamese prisons]
	"Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a
    fabrication is to review Quang's career. In 1972, he said, Quang was
    not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in Military Region 4
    in central Vietnam."

2) I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for
   bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat , owned by CoS, filed a
   class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues
   to become members of the Church. Anyone heard more about this?

3) Micheal Jackson went into business with Micheal Milken. No lie.

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of

the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It
is not "produced": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for
example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an
earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiian
word for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call "savages".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would
behoove you to study *all* of the facts.

You asked a question, and now you don't want people to answer?  I believe
a legitimate question was asked.  Why shouldn't cost and safety be used
(at least in part) to determine legality?

I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea.
Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that
drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as
William F. Buckley supports it.

Your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria
(safer AND cheaper).  Obviously, killing people is not "safe".  As for
prostitution, why shouldn't it be legal?

The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to "citizens",
but it makes several references to "people". For example, Article IV:
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated"; Article V: "no person shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by
a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law"; Article VIII: "excessive bail
shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
punishments inflicted".

Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens;
aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.?
Whether slaves were considered "not human" I don't know, but it seems
that a case could be made that they weren't treated as "people" as defined
in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the
Declaration of Independence which states that "all Men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness",
it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition
of humanity.

Absolutely.  If Yoni and Bibi Natanyahu are "typical jew leader"s,
then I personally am proud to aspire to such a status (disregarding
Hamaza H. Salah's negative connotation of Jews).  Yoni was a great
man and a Harvard grad who died for his country and people.  Bibi
is also a great leader who will undoubtedly be a major force in
Middle East politics for many years to come.

Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people),
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people.

The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was
an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad
precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  That principle
applies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers,
feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Why
was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
also have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than
peoples' lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals in
our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.

It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the
"Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." He
also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it.
However, I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
world had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhaps
especially, christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.  Maybe David
Koresh really was Jesus Christ (sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
new major religion to me).

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association.

 Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to
Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers
 To: National Desk, Defense Writer
 Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of
          the United States, 202-479-2258

   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers
Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base
Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give
sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close
56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.
   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of
Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list
ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior
service personnel.
   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),
suggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that they
are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve
components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of
participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future."
   He asked the commission "to remove from consideration all
locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to
warrant approval of the requested action."
   "Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve
installations on this list are large enough to have a significant
impact on the community, if closed," wrote Hultman.  "The major
issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large
percentage of the existing locations."
   Hultman reminded the commission, "The fact that the vast
majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come
close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this
process certainly supports the thesis" that these actions are
simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and
Marine Corps Reserve.
   ROA also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of
Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480
Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are
approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities."
   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging
from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval
Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to
Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve
Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,
Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.
   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El
Toro, Calif., plus six others.

       I wonder if he realizes the irony of a Federal Secretary
invoking a rabid anti-federalist in support of federal education
programs?

Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I haven't had a professor who didn't,
though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend
had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had
been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway.
He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and
finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him

At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.
Teaching is definitely more the goal, and sometimes, it actually happens.
The best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best
professors I had at UCLA and USC.

_________________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993


                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE


                            Hyatt Regency
                        Crystal City, Virginia


11:22 A.M. EDT


	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that
Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today
about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to
get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature
of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of
people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of
those who are here.

	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education
and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my
good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and
all of the business and local community leaders from the city and
county and state level from around America who are here.

	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved
hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is
their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A
year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because
I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our
country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had
too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines
of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to
take us into the future.

	     I entered with the hope that together we could create
more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of
our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of
America's community, knowing that together we could always to more
than we could individually and that we might secure our future.

	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000
jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the
commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here,
and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs
does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this
stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all
those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're
on the right track.

	     Last July when I was traveling across America's
heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in
Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business
people who were participating in the Louisville Education and
Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.
I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed
both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my
own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about
-- that for millions of American young people it is really an
impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good
workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what
is learning.

	     In the world in which we are living, the average young
person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a
lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning
world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young
people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased
here today.

	     Whether you're in business or in government or in
education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to
building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all
of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things
are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best
thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have
jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)

	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty
good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that
they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either
political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great
challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to
fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work
for them to do.

	     All the European countries have higher unemployment
rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the
unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.
They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its
most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that
I have proposed to create jobs.

	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now
about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.
It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of
pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing
their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their
people.

	     But it is especially important for America for two
reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move
aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be
competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is,
even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed
of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to
work in this country.  (Applause.)

	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some
of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and
moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We
have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big
organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they
are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working
at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to
create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the
chance to work.

	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare
reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of
months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the
end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.
(Applause.)

	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of
the American people to perform without regard to race or income or
the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that
there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their
talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.
I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if
you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more
responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this
country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you
have got to have opportunity in that mix.

	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for
every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules
and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be
something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are
basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners,
recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of
our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their
background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's
something there for them to do?

	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an
integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of
work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people
first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private
sector.

	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in
February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000
extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the
American business community to meet that target so that we can create
more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been
created before.

	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And
Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in
this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more
than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people
a work experience.  And it is terribly important.

	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is
part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the
American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their
jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving
the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to
college but do need at least two years of post-high school training
either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting,
so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more
people to go on to college who do want to go.

	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive
plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The
emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would
create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and
that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It
would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work
force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.

	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to
invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --
projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects,
new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities
-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve
the environment.

	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that
because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the
Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching
out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer
jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to
hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young
people into further educational opportunities and to further job
opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component
to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government
has never fully emphasized before.

	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because
they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in
difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building
their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other
areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who
have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what
they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next
year.

	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the
opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning
skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next
couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school
in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning
environment.

	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities
for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this
will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will
be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new
work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.

	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-
work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding
the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help
to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve
local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public
buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in
hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers,
and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while
they earn, but letting them earn.

	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people
who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should
do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the
opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing
in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't
exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare
system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people
to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the
use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if
you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to
reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.
(Applause.)

	     The young people we propose to put to work under our
program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math,
reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will
stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a
sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge,
but a challenge that will take them into a different life.

	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even
as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the
summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll
see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer
academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved
ahead.  I suspect that they will.

	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I
will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn
from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next
summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school
year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that
we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so
that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private
investments as well.

	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the
business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this
summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business
who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who
haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about
this event today, I want to implore other private employers to
stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this
summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when
we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort
them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)

	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up
here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking
about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've
done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very
foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand
and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had
ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be
worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)

	     That does not mean young people should not be
entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation
ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and
worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.
And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some
people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)

	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I
grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul
without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a
job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to
people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a
job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now
I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any
more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're
working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.
And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these
young people want.

	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:
It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration
pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private
sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn
how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created
in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done
off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a
third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do
economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of
America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just
kidding.

	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy
country in the world, including the United States, is having
difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done
I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole
deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the
answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.
(Applause.)

	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to
Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the
counties, through the Community Development Program, with the
infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an
attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the
economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little
boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a
million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.

	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in
the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government
money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American
economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind
of system we have and it works pretty well.

	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you
here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends
and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers
to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the
funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government
should create this summer, so that together we can have this
partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a
future -- a future that our young people can believe in.

	     We need to send them a message that here in America if
you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute
something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.
You can build a future from you own dreams.

	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together
that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of
the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise
has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.

	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS


                          The Briefing Room


12:40 P.M. EDT


	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take
questions today.

	     Q	  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton
administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the
United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that
the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has
said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously,
this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't
come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look
seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime,
we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in
the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the
negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something
the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the
table.

	     Q	  How much longer are you going to give them to come
to the table, George?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.

	     Q	  It's been a long time.

	     Q	  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value
added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by
reporters, he said -- quote -- "That is a radical change in the tax
system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to
look at in the years ahead."  Questioned again about it later he
says, "It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we
start considering it, I'll tell you."  It wasn't a trial balloon or
anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a
question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -
- "Certainly we're looking at a VAT."  What's gone on?

	     Q	  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is
reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.
And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not
going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.

	     Q	  But you have also said from this podium time and
time again --

	     Q	  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.

	     Q	     that that was not under consideration.

	     Q	  Yes.  Clinton says, "It is not something that is
now under consideration."  Is that no longer true?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms.
Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been
made of any kind.

	     Q	  Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if
it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he
didn't tell us about it or --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under
consideration or if it was something to be proposed?

	     Q	  "If we start considering I'll tell you."

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?

	     Q	  "If we start considering it, I'll tell you."
That's a direct quote.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a
number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.
The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the
proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and
cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform
the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have
looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of
different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.

	     Q	  Well, is the President aware of their consideration
of this option?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed
on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task
force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that
that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with
the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe
that that's been presented to him, no.

	     Q	  Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him
what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very
deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be
made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision-
making point.

	     Q	  If this is still under consideration, that's a
change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about
three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking
about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I
remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that
not the case?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has
been presented to the President as something that is being looked at
at some level in the task force.

	     Q	  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other
options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled
out.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is
being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean,
it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the
decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of
different options.

	     Q	  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out
now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?

	     Q	  When a guy says in February --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are
looking at the widest possible range of options.

	     Q	  So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it
before; they're looking at it now.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working
groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide
net.

	     Q	  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able
to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now
are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are
looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --

	     Q	  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly
ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those
are the President's words.  Those are very clear.

	     Q	  Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny
that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled
it out?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I
think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say
they stand.

	     Q	  So don't they stand any longer?

	     Q	  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five
years it was ruled out.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President
did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate
track, and as I said, I don't believe --

	     Q	  Separate from the President?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been
presented to the President.

	     Q	  Are they considering something that the President
--

	     Q	  Has ruled out?

	     Q	     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President
consider a VAT tax?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not
presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of
options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly
listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.

	     Q	  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in
Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax
system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it
might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the
case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what
you're asking.

	     Q	  He talked about the VAT in the context of a
restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health
care, for example.

	     Q	  Or anything else.

	     Q	  Or anything else.

	     Q	  It was always in the context of substituting for
other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.

	     Q	  Has that change, too?

	     Q	  Is that still his view?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those
specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the
working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes,
they have.

	     Q	  Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility
of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a
decision?  No, he has not.

	     Q	  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the
President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his
ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line
reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has
specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then
goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the
President concerned about that sort of thing?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's
concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal
possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most
thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the
different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with
something like that it's certainly something the President will
explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those
lines.

	     Q	  What does it mean exactly, though, when the
President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the
table later if a more persuasive argument is made?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably
true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He
has not made a proposal.

	     Q	  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open
to it before?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to
the argument.

	     Q	  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a
short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in
Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was
that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not
something he was proposing, not something he was floating.

	     Q	  Not something he was considering.  Those are his
words -- "It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we
start considering it, I'll tell you."  You're now acknowledging, are
you not, that it is under consideration and --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task
force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the
President has not made a decision on it.

	     Q	  But the door is open for the President to
reconsider including this as part of --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are
looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.

	     Q	  Do you know if they will make a presentation on
behalf of the VAT to him?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that
if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know
that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they
should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups
are looking at.

	     Q	  Do you understand, George, that none of us are
asking these questions in context of a decision that the President
has made, only about what the President is considering?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am
acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a
VAT.

	     Q	  And the President will consider it?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the
argument if it is presented to him.

	     Q	  Does that mean the President -- that working groups
think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working
groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.

	     Q	  George, can I ask you another question about
Bosnia?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)

	     Q	  No, he wants us to stay on this.

	     Q	  Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)

	     Q	  No, he got out of that swamp.

	     Q	  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.
Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said
that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked
out -- quote -- "We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the
arms embargo together with our allies."  That seems to go a bit
further than what you've just said --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just
said.

	     Q	  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept
what Reggie --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that
this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he
will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the
table.

	     Q	  Isn't there some kind of timetable here?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's
going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.

	     Q	  That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the
sanctions.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.
And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope
that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr.
Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also
working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to
pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option
as well.

	     Q	  The question is whether there's a timetable for
consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo,
not the sanctions.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on
sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting
the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both
internally and with our allies.

	     Q	  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the
U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is
something that's under consideration, and this is something that we
take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should
know the consequences of failing to come to the table.

	     Q	  Have they been given a deadline?

	     Q	  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing
and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why
should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo
when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the
fighting in Bosnia?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of
your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an
effect.

	     Q	  What effect?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed
our warnings, then they will face the consequences.

	     Q	  What effect has it had in Bosnia?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on
the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their
shipments through.  We can brief more fully --

	     Q	  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it
had?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's
stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to
press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we
will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.
I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't
happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can
weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come
to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.

	     Q	  Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th
-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the
United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if
the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that
we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going
to --

	     Q	  But on that deadline?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but
we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution,
by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails
to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other
actions.

	     Q	  Isn't this awfully incremental?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step
approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to
continue to do that.

	     Q	  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time
all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved
their goals and then what's the purpose?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the
Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many
different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're
pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through
tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms
embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will
continue to do that.

	     Q	  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in
getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any
campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean,
once they're entrenched --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're
going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're
going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't
see into the future.

	     Q	  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans
say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to
try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which
show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.
What's your strategy to counter that?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one
we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up
the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package
will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner
cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point
out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.
We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to
point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the
Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or
they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years.

	     Q	  Does it concern you, though, that the House now,
the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against
it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.

	     Q	  George, does it strike anybody in the
administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President
did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- "a
reaffirmation of a promise of America"?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the
promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full
potential.

	     Q	  Government-funded jobs?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?
Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.

	     Q	  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday
-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at
it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This
will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.

	     Q	  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus
package?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.

	     Q	  Where does that number come from?  Because we've
been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000
new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something
like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when
you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will
receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time
job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.

	     Q	  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --

	     Q	  One to four because it's three months.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.

	     Q	  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President
misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money
for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the
private sector?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think
that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you
pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to
the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.

	     Q	  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to
work at Time-Warner?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually
somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to
be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where
there would be grants to businesses.

	     Q	  Has the President spoken with any Senate
Republicans this week?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:
No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the
White House.

	     Q	  At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.

	     Q	  Getting any closer to get the votes?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it.

	     Q	  Anybody leaning your way?

	     Q	  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting
something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup
leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what
impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to
say yesterday in his report?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.
I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would
leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has
returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White
House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time
again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a
final resolution to a broader political settlement.

	     Q	  George, yesterday you offered some selective
breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.
Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be
impacted?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states,
yes.  And I think we can get it out.

	     Q	  Could you make that generally available?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.

	     Q	  And could you do it by the component of the
stimulus?  In other words --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know
that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how
deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into
summer jobs and other jobs.

	     Q	  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that
Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the
states?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but
they're press releases.

	     Q	  Can you describe what those press releases contain?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the
benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know
that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.
And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package
creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New
Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that
this is important.

	     Q	  Where are the releases going?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.

	     Q	  To whom?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.

	     Q	  Can we get it?

	     Q	  Why don't you put them out here as well?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.

	     Q	  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.
But as soon as we can.

	     Q	  Are you focusing these press releases on states
where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many
as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and
we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.

	     Q	  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's
schedule?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it.

	     Q	  Are press releases going along to states where he's
visiting?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that
probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)

	     Q	  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?
(Laughter.)

	     Q	  George, as the President goes about the business of
defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what
seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with
deficit spending rather than "if it's so important, why not come up
with the funding for it" seems to be the Republican argument.  And
how do you answer that?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying
for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this
package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-
start for jobs.

	     Q	  You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add
to the deficit this year?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over
time.  I didn't say that.

	     Q	  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the
beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --
deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But
over time our budget fully pays for this program.

	     Q	  What you're saying is that there are savings that
would cover this if it were this year in future years?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I
said.

	     Q	  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding
debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by
$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.

	     Q	  You mean you're reducing it below what it would
have been?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.

	     Q	  In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the
national debt over the period of --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from
what it would have been.  That's true.

	     Q	  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)

	     Q	  You're getting to be a grumpy old man.

	     Q	  George, has any decision been made about the White
House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming
up in a week and a half?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's
schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic
retreat in Jamestown that weekend.

	     Q	  Will he address it by phone?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a
little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.

	     Q	  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before
the speech?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that
at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.
I don't know the schedule on it, though.

	     Q	  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in
conjunction with the event?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.

	     Q	  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President
going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign
the biodiversity treaty that day?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on
the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but
I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around
then.

	     Q	  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie
McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't
know exactly what.

	     Q	  When is Earth Day?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.

	     Q	  Why is it you know that he is going to have a
statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a
statement on the gay rights march?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going
to meet or when he's going to meet.

	     Q	  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't
be surprised if he did, though.

	     Q	  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and
the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of
issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and
the trade issues between the two countries.

	     Q	  There was some expectations that a second aid
package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if
I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status
on that?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on
and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked
about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to
continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.

	     Q?	    We will not then make any kind of announcement
during the two-day meeting?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.

	     Q	  Is that when you're going to make one?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.

	     Q	     the President's going to announce it tomorrow.

	     Q	  Bentsen said that.

	     Q	  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.

	     Q	  So did Christopher.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I
believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of
Tokyo.

	     Q	  George, has there been further consideration here
about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's
not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.

	     Q	  George, you all have a position or do you support
Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United
States?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.

	     Q	  George, there was a report today about the --

	     Q	  Fortunately.  (Laughter.)

	     Q	     about the pace of appointments and says that
President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions
that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the
pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's
appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147
noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means --
(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's
about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along
farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a
multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect
the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously
we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.

	     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the
background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time
than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're
working on it.

	     Q	  Is that because of Nannygate?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of
it, yes.

	     Q	  In the story this morning, you were at
approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way
behind in winning confirmations.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks
comes into play.  That's the problem.

	     Q	  That's the background checks problem?  Because I
mean, you have a Democratic Senate --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the
appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all
the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where
the problem is.

	     Q	  What's the President doing this afternoon, and
what's on the plan for tomorrow?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just
office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of
issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then
he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on
the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And
Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.

	     Q	  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow,
George?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.

	     Q	  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the
Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but
we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these
visits.

	     Q	  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you
know what that was about?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group
of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.

	     Q	  Who?

	     Q	  Reverend Jackson.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty,
me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan.

	     Q	  Talking about Haiti?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban
policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from
Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going
on to Los Angeles.

	     Q	  Did he request the meeting?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual
contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of
issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.

	     Q	  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords
tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at
all on this?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact,
sure.

	     Q	  Can you tell us about the contacts?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure --

	     Q	  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to
him and they just has a general talk about the package.

	     Q	  And did he express his support for it now, or is he
--

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the
conversation, but there have been conversations.

	     Q	  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --
elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care
package.  Is this something the President is considering?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --

	     Q	  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's
been looked at, but no decisions have been made.

	     Q	  What was the question?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether
abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.

	     Q	  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your
meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice
about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of
the verdict in L.A.?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the
situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic
development and other issues.

	     Q	  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be
helpful for the President to go there or not?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of
issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.

	     Q	  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in,
I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.

	     Q	     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments
that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard
on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue
to do that.

	     Q	  Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your
talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't
have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20
people or --

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've
talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.

	     Q	  Anyone leaning your way?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just

Guido, before you have a hemmorage, maybe we can lighten up, Ok. You
have opinions as do I. Flaming at each other will not get us anywhere in
the understand of our respective positions. I offer a hand of
friendship, a truce, if it may, so that maybe we can start this
conversation like gentelmen (I am sorry if that was a mistake, from your
name I can't tell gender, you know us stupid Americans). Since you have
replied to my wife's post you must have some strong feelings about this
issue. I would like to hear them, and understand them if I can. In
return all I ask is for you to listen to me, and try to understand why I
feel the way I do.
All the yelling and all the hate about this issue just drives the sides
farther apart, till they forget why they started the fight in the first
place. If you and I can forster an understand and mutual respect for
each others views than maybe, and only then really can we come up with a
solution that is acceptable to us both.

  What, pray tell, does this mean? Just who exactly is *they*?
You mean "they" as in people who do not blindly swallow every
piece of propoganda they are given? Or "they" as in NOKD (not
our kind, dear). Or "they" as in an appeal to some audience
that is supposed to implicitly know and understand?

  From a pragmatic standpoint, there certainly is some justification
if it is a vice people will commit anyway. Shall we criminalize
alcohol again? If the re-legalization for alcohol were done from
anything other than the pragmatic standpoint, I'd be happy to hear
about it. The fact is that it wasn't.

  Only the first one make any sense. There is nothing to "legalize"
about all the rest. Just in case you haven't made the connection
(which I expect you haven't) the connecting theme in this thread is
a persons autonomy over their life and body. Vice statutes serve
only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous
for the poor, as Tim so eloquently put it. People will, however,
take autonomy over their lives, regardless of what the government
says.
  And why, pray tell, is AIDS "victim" in snear quotes? Are you of
the revisionist sort that thinks there is no such thing as the AIDS
plauge? Or do they just deserve it?

Reduced?  Abortion is a lot cheaper than pre-natal care and birth.
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term, I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money.

Fascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of
Anyone?
Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge

"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that
Hitler was original and showed initiative."
--Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,
October 27, 1992.

(NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of
Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to
Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was
independent and sharp as a scalpel.
	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At
least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the
idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for
delivery.
	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the
most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are
noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with
passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in
fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost
identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German
election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and
enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their
ideological quilt.
	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening
pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the
German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway
line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)
was "betrayed to France by a representative of his government" when
there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.
	In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as
the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost
succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic
claim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement
ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional." Of
course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of
God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is
too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.
	Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,
my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern
American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version
of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),
and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen
million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book
after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in
Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.
	Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily
three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary
propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way
Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a
translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the
printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since
radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of
luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to
spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop
$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.
	But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some
cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of
their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these
days.)
	Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf
Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of
ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio
program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk
show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows
that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the
opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh
earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a
RICO indictment.
	On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of
material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For
example:

On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society
	Hitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who
individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly
perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in
order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of
imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight
for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of
thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises"
(page 577).
	Limbaugh: "Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The
show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase "with half my
brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental
aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree
with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media
will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking
and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)

On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
	Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are
inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his
decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without
culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord
sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the
expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)
	Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...
But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or
ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a
charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools
for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of
American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)

On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
	Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...
One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and
theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...
Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays
must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the
service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)
	Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that
Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people
who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality
and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)

On the News Meida
	Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of
gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass
by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the
people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of
slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)
	Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the
bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been
replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During
the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global
network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't
realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that
therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided
and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)

*     *     *

To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but
ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.
	After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that
haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened
Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed
Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,
Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to
depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American
radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the
Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for
The Fascist States of America.
	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the
radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only
wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.

Man Heather, you are trying to make me think again. First, heart

To answer your question above, why should people who are

more time, if you are going to engage in an act (eating, watching the

responsible for your actions and the conquences of that action.

HS>Why limit yourself to just situations which are related to sexual behavior?

I'am not, it is just that babies are dieing and I need to move on that
right now. Do one thing right and do it well.

  _______________________________________________________________

  For Immediate Release	   	     	           April 14, 1993


                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE


                           April 13, 1993


  Dear Mr. Speaker:      (Dear Mr. President:)

  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully
  informed, I am providing this report, consistent with section 4
  of the War Powers Resolution, to advise you of actions that I
  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in
  Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of
  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively
  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security
  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all
  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There
  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages
  in Bosnia have been bombed.

  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided,
  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all
  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize
  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-
  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.
  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air
  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General
  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY
  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating
  allies.

  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my
  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to
  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct
  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by
  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces
  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and
  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.
  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m.
  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for
  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.

  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air
  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early
  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally
  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the
  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching
  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted,
  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these
  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such
  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by
  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved

                                more

                                  2

  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will
  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations
  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was
  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully
  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.

  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such
  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces
  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional
  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-
  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and
  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward
  toward attainment of our goals in this region.

       	    	      	   	Sincerely,




       	    	      	   	WILLIAM J. CLINTON

If you want to see environmental disasters, go to eastern Europe or some
parts of the FSU (former Soviet Union).  This is because they had no
environmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity
at any expense to justify their political systems.  Luckily for us, some
of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws.  That
isn't to say that they shouldn't be modified, but all I ever hear from
you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of
left-wing tree-huggers intent on putting us back on horseback.  Yes,
there are some of those, but a lot of us simply want to procede with
caution.

#You are making a ludicrous suggestion.

As a Latter-day Saint, I found John's statement *not at all* ludicrous...

Please allow me to explain myself.  In 1838, the governor of Missouri,
governor Boggs, issued his so-called "Mormon extermination order."  The
only crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was
their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still
allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.

I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bow
to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"
brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements...

In the 1850s, the so-called "Utah-War" was forced upon the early Mormon
settlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living as
their conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's
(or "Deseret Territory" as it was called at the time) constitutional
daily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of
the United States of America, an entire army under the command of General
Johnson (hence "Johnson's Army"), invaded the territory to "restore"
Uncle Sam's law and order...)

History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events
that might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit and
intent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found in
this user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or
"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectively
blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism
et al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a "threat" to various
establishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-
tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that those
who oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despite
their claims of adhering to a gospel of love...

In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from
being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I
may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church
leader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"
missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision from
secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off.

Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT without
questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
resolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Waco
was NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with
John, I too wonder who or what's next...

#|> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise
#|> of their rights to worship and bear arms.  Now we don't.
#
#Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing
#ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but
#Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket
#launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under
#"right to bear arms."

Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?
What REALLY caused the "murder" of the little children?  Could it be that
the ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would you
interpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,
Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.

David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the
executioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officers
may have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubious
public/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how to
sell this one to the nation...

and will undoubtedly happen again. Indeed, WHO IS NEXT.  So-called "Illegal
activities" can be twisted and bend to suit anyone's need, including the
agendas of secular authorities...

Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government
is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests.  As a
left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as
you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto
dealers.

But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,
to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,
and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a
particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
interests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly
designed to accomplish the opposite.

Larry,

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expects/fears one might need.
If one is opposed to abortion, one should not be required to pay for
"coverage" of it because one will NEVER want to use that "service" and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder.

	I have come to the conclusion that the TV stations here in LA

	In a not so subtle way they are preparing their audience for the

Phill, here in Indiana, where we not only have CCWs (permits to
carry firearms), but we also have a fairly low crime rate.  At any one
given point the occupants in my vehicles are likely to be armed.
I've never had to use my gun, but am prepared to do so if I am
attacked.  In essence, I'm quite prepared.  I also have, in the glove
box, my proof of insurance, as mandated by Indiana law.  So, if I got
into an accident and had to whip out my insurance policy to prove that
I can pay for any damages I may have caused will you "wonder why I'm
so prepared for an accident"?  Even where it not Indiana law I would
still be carrying my automobile insurance.  I also wear my seatbelt.
Does that make me bad for "preparing for an accident"?

Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land
from South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves
me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he
wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.

He died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.

Good thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south),
and the Falkland Islands.

Don't understand the concept of insurance, do you Anthony?

What is insurance for?

To spread the cost of illness/accident/etc that does occur in a small
percentage of cases, over many.  Those who do not face the accident/etc
have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did, those
who do face the accident/etc *are* not devestated (financially anyhow)
in dealing with it.

This 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances is
stupid.  Bad things happen to good people, too, you know.

Agreed.

It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just
as Marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition.

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case,
"limited" and "big" government are not defined.  I would point out that
Lebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
with "limited" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western
Europe (where "people would rather live") are often pointed out as
nations with "big government" from a libertarian point of view.

The argument is not between those who want "limited" government and those
who want "unlimited" government.  It is between those who believe
government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical
grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.

You think that you all have it bad....here at good ol' Southwest Missouri
State U., we have 2 parties running for student body president.  There's the
token sorority/fraternity faces, and then there's the president and vice
president of NORML.  They campaigned by handing out condoms and listing
their qualifications as,"I listen really well."  It makes me sick to have
a party established on many of the things that are ruining this country like
they are.  I think I'll run next year.:(

In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so.

Think about it.  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very
clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the

I think so.  And I don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol
and coffee).

	I've never seen CNN give out the poll questions on the air.
If you sent them a letter asking for them, you might get them.  Here's
my guess of how part of a session might look:

Question: Do you approve of Clinton's performance?
Answer: No
Questions: Do you disapprove due to the gays in the military issue?
Answer: Yes

Conclusion: Clinton has a low approval rating because he's not moving
fast enough on gays in the military.


	I think any group truly dedicated to reporting the news would
not use manufactured news like polls.

OOooooHhhh!  He admits it!  The infamous "first step".  Let's look at
it this way.  I have never harmed anyone with my firearms.  I have
successfully defended myself with them.  I have successfully procurred
food with them.  I have successfully had much enjoyment in target
practicing with them.

In that order firearms are important to me.  Friend, I was raped as a
child by an older child who had a knife.  That ain't never gonna
happen again.  There is no one, including yourself, who will *ever*
make me a victim again.  As long as you don't try to make me a victim,
I will leave you alone.  But if you *ever* try to make me a victim,
I'll fight you all the way, such as I'm doing now.  And I'll fight you
with a response appropriate to the situation.  Now, you aren't
advocating making me a victim are you?  Exactly what are you doing?

Fishing rights are disputed.  Between 2 nations, no matter *how*
friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.

What I was getting at was the 54 40' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute.  No one is saying 54 40' or fight
about fishing rights.  The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.

Fishing rights...small potatoes.

Summary: GM's quest for justice

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion, even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not
from the fire.

	Thoughts?

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear.

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed?
Shouldn't that be up to a jury?

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?  Shouldn't that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?

	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?

Go for it.  I have yet to see anybody justify the

This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to
fix the health care problem.  Look at the whole picture, not just
randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to
use "non-initiated force" to achieve its goals, than no special interest
can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education
monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government
reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants "embrace" libertarianism.
That's the best means I've seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]

It's amazing to me that governments around the world will try every

How about connections between BCCI and TCI?  Reference to the BCCI
money laundering appears in an insert in an article about the TCI
cable company and its sharp -- and possibly illegal -- business
practices.  The article is in the 27-Jan-92 issue of the Wall Street

  Why don't both you bigots pick up a couple of dull knives and finish this

True.  But forcing her to remain pregnant continues the violation of

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT.
Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was
never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it,
thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---
one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).

The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down
our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any
mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and
the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved
in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not
fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending,
they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by
the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years).
While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up
in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business
rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent
for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary
Clinton ...

Those areas became states.

Puerto Rico has the population needed to become a state.  But the ethnic
mix there is such that Puerto Rico will probably never become a state.

I say we cut them loose.  If they don't want to become a state, we
shouldn't continue to subsidize their existence.

Do you have a cite for the case?  You don't give enough
information to be able to compare the two situations.
If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music
into the landlord's home all day and night, then I could
see how the opinion would be justified.  But this court
order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying
pictures of dead fetuses, which doesn't disrupt the privacy
of anyone inside the clinic.

> He pointed out that

Perhaps in the privacy of their homes, but not on public
property.  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York
city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters
outside his store?  Patrons inside the store could hear the
protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how
is that different from the abortion protesters asking women
to re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?

Even if the protesters' speech could be considered
"harassment" (which it is not), hate speech laws have
generally been struck down by the courts.  I don't see
how the words ``don't kill your baby'' or ``abortion is
murder'' could be considered harassment.

Some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying
quietly on a public sidewalk.  Yeah, I could see how
that might be equivalent to "bombing" and "murder".
Uh huh.  Let us know when you get a grip on reality.

By such things, do you mean any use of military forces against US

The ultimate statement for equal rights (something many of the feminazis
have forgotten) is "I do not care if you are either a man or a woman,
I do not care if you are black or white, I do not care if you are gay
or straight." Once you can honistly say "I do not care about color,
race, or gender or sexual preference", then we will truly be on the
right track.

Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along?
Get real! So long as you try to make me care if you are black, female,
or whatever, I am going to continue to balk. It's natural human behaviour.

But the moment employers searching for employees, banks looking to lend
money, and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly
say "I do not care about your color, race, gender, or sexual preferences;
I instend instead to treat you as a human being," crap like last year's
riots will continue to happen.

>1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!

Barf.

You mean the same economic theorists who say things like "for the sake
of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is
no wealth creation" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in
real life?

Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapter
of that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right there
in chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:

	"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,
	especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently
	the province of individuals who create new inventions and
	discover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of this
	book that there is no wealth creation.

	"We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,
	however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently
	unpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assume
	no wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical
	economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid
	as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested."

So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now
assuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing an
idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simple
things.

To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experience
building bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical
physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less
position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
have "a positive view" of one's self.

This of course, is foolish.

Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a "positive
view" of themselves?

Of course not.

A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,
and IF you believe in the concept of "society", then your only choice is
to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.

Since the actual verdicts were not known by the authorities, it was
smart not to allow "Friday night for fighting" (sorry, Elton) and to
seal them for this morning.  Also, it allows for maximum daylight to
wear down and frustrate any potential troublemakers, as well as give
more preparation time.

We had cutovers to LA's KNBC on our WNBC, and I didn't recall this

>Won't the rioters have a surprise waiting for them when they wake
>up later today!

A net-contact in L.A. tells me that the alert will remain over this
weekend, as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts
on three of five charges (the aiding-and-abetting).  Those acquittals
seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind
of angel that night, speeding and fleeing et al.  However ...  Another
consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on
the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for
overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops
interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  Also, some elements
may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb
move, obviously).  And, Koreans are still scared and certain people
are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year.

A Commander from Nassau, Long Island was questioned about how his
people would have handled Rodney King, and he said "We'd have let
him roll around in the dirt 'til he got tired, then handcuff him".

Oh, no, not in this case. I've noticed that you conveniently edited out your
stupid comment that the PRC stands for Cambodia. When we're arguing the
Vietnam war and about Cambodia, and you toss in a boner like that (along
with your other boners), you are an ignorant asshole.

Oh, and even the Vietnamese agree that they did far more damage to
Cambodia than we ever did.

Uh, well, Golly Gee Whiz. Let me see, when the new President, as his first
big "policy act" tries to force homosexuals (acceptance thereof) on the
military, despite polls showing a consistent 75%+ against it, and the
minority is only 1%, well, gee, I sure think that is newsworthy.

Hmm, you still don't get it. Then again, I'm not posting from a  University

Tell me, committed any anti-semitic acts today? What kind of boots do you

And still -- Libertarians want the State out of their lives. Parents are very

There is no need to include the VAT from previous levels because
the VAT is a "difference" tax...if the VAT is X%, than the amount
of tax the government receives through all the levels is X% of
the purchase price of the end consumer.  At the intervening levels,
only the difference between the VAT paid out and the VAT received
is remitted to the government.

A VAT is infinitely preferable to a retail sails tax...

Just to follow up on Casper's posting. I have been following this business
since it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.
Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the people
next door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and never
bothered anybody.

There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within the
movement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interest
would ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesing
illegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained
(properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that an
illegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for converting
semi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.

In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch of
macho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifying
themselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is no
surprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and I
might have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house by
mistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I would
shoot first and wonder later.

So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant
(how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) and
presented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes with
the law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he was
acquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people acted
peacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks to
indicate that they were any danger to society.

NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists or
slight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to be
looney or zany.

Look and learn folks. And be VERY afraid.

In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the
scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political
implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it
is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed
followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political
lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.

Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does
this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder
because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent
supporter?

One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system
was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party
itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was
noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not
originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it
until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged
upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of
his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the
old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications
of their rhetoric.

This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must
be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race"
of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of
humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,
the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who
lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the
evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.
Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego
cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however
mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and
his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can
produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be
emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between
a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to
govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the
latter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are made
necessary by an essential weakness.

It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they
amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the
same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause
of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their
logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties
such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert
the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates
of a system that would commit genocide.

The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is
inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let
the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that
were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of
the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly
does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.

No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon
election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.
If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made
the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates
a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many
in government politics is a method of providing a justification for
their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A
rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the
continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the
essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli
which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important
to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right
and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement
of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.
In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through
their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.

It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics
of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The
leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do
so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a
task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of
ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore
in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole
before personal concerns, even of personal security.

Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred
and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit
genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of
the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility
of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to
control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot
affect the system.

What suburban kid would want to hold down a minimum wage job when there is so
much more money to be made dealing drugs?

Yet, somehow, surburban kids do hold down minimum wage jobs.  So do inner
city kids, when give the chance.  Any reason you think that inner city kids
are incapable of doing legitimate work?

No one is a "rioter" until they participate in a "riot", which is
unlikely to happen, now.

Most of the *people* in L.A. are likely to have gotten up early to
listen to the court announcement.

I don't think he was told.

       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's
violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our
non-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It
would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun
control laws.

       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and
enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then
that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.

>Given that most

       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished
because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a
crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the
question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising
gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to "magically"
keep the guns out, but now isn't.)

>It certainly makes
>sense that it would.  (Well, it makes sense to some of us, anyway.  ;-)

       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs"
are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.
I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals
have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources
(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply
see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as
well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.

        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques
of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come
to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost
entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed
for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you
compared the white majority they were virutally identical.

        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.
non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative
conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of
nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into
account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the
same conditions.

        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,
then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are
arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far
higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only
not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly
lower.

       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. "inner-city"
problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition
which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent
crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control
is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one
Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control
in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase
in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently
they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in
the early eighties.

>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already

       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where
gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that
crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.

       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high
or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact
violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it
was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by
saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted
to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you
can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of
that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control
was implemented, just as happened in Canada.

>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.

       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent
of gun control.

       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what
others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would
sell to them?

       Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the
question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal
to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written
with something else in mind and "propoganda" put out by its supporters.

       But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time
you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?

       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really*
means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.

       If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why
on earth did you make a point of calling them "propogranda?"  That
would seem to be irrelevent.

       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe

good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because
they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't
think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.

       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political
system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this
particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure
and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)

        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have

        Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While
the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although
badly) to the U.S. President.

        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives
is "in principle" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)
but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the
Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh
darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put
those extra restrictions on the Senate in?

      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell
you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of
government to "attack" which presents them with the best chance of
getting what they want.  With national "interest groups" it is simply
a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a
law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less
"contributions" to make.

      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at
the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little
state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,
medicine, and most other questions.

      Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it
should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local
interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their
rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,
only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because
it can impose its will on the lower.

      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres
of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-
and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed
to a local crime?

      The more people want the more Congress will take power to "sell"
it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of "special interests"
is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.

       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher
levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
in effectiveness.

       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I
remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable
of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if
you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that
state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power
and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get
what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.

       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off"
states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.

       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself
that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres
has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact
national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem
is significantly reduced.

>The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility
>to come to a decision.

       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable
to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering
the government the usually the institution with the sole power to
enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those
decisions a good thing.

>Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't

       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have
more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution
than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is
harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing
new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out
without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the
entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different
areas, different solutions may be called for.

       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local
and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to
the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the
majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end
up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in
Washington with half a million or more constituents.

       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels
are more corrupt.

       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were
arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators
should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was
suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was
nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.
Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders
wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,
I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,
which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for
the House.

       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration
of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other
examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the
reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)

       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something
it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering
the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying
about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which
almost necessitates its abuse.

       *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of
which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's
anything resembling a record.

       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system
against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when
dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal
power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to
got through something more than a bare majority

       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster
to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.

       Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring
60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*
argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.

       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority
for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population
groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities
should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough
about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority
being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing
the *federal* system against action.

Sigh.  It's so amusing to watch bigots point fingers at what they imagine to
be other bigots.  I do believe this person meant "bean *counting*".  And are
you trying to suggest that only Hispanics eat beans?  Or that they even have
a monopoly on eating beans?  Or that this person is seriously promoting what
is obviously a tongue-in-cheek .sig?

You must have a brain somewhere, if you can cause your fingers to type.  Use
it.

What in the Tree makes you think we queers CAN'T experience that commitment?
What's stopping us from committing to one partner for the rest of our lives?
I have every intention of doing so, once I find the right person...and
whether that person is male or female, I seriously doubt that a church
ceremony/public vow/licence will make any difference whatsoever in the sort
of commitment I experience with that person.  You have no conception of the

     I'm curious why you took a beign statement and cross-posted it to several
different news groups, including something along the lines of alt.discrimination  Look Rodney King is black and large.  I have several large black male friends,and they are referred to as being large black men ( to their faces, and by
themselves ).  You know, Ted, I have a large number of adjectives for you,
but I will spare you most of them because I try not to get into personal
flame wars.  Let me just say that I think your action of cross posting this
was total BS, and you're trying to start some crap.  Hopefully, others will
see through your trite little game and not play along.

	Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
of crimes no more represent the "Black community" than racist hateful Whites
represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities
who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe
otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.
	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the
demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,
and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're
going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic
group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors
leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than
not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.
	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few
Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime
statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then
worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable
or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
define "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous
when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
humans.
	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the
*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial
makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in
San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, we
have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs,
and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly
troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their
propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on
the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and
crime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles last
year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I
remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned
from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly
multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that
in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*
riot!
	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the
racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As
a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem
becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly
believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current
course of denial and repression.
	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,
luck in avoiding the "trap".
	Peace, my brother.

First, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana
or its derivitives.  Every other drug that I can think of can kill you if you
take to much.  (By the very nature of these drugs, your decision making skills
aren't up to par.  That is how it differs from asprin, flinstone vitamins, etc.
We don't even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter.)

Second, we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in
this country.  If marijuana were legal, undoubtedly more people would use it,
and that IS a problem.  People use it, get stupid, and hurt other people.

In regard to Woody's post, I thought I would remind him of something in
the midst of his tirade against academia:
As a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap Reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant Laffer curve (NOT!) I
think we need to look with open minds upon any ideas which will allow us
to directly address the problems of the gigantic federal deficit and debt and
continue to allow our economy to expand--and I don't remember Woody and co.
complaining about academia while Laffer implemented his policy, Stockman
approved it while being fully aware the numbers not adding up, and Reagan
completing the largest con job of the century which my generation and I will now have to pay for.

Roughly one-half of Noam Chomsky's slim volume "Pirates and Emperors" is

unjustified bombing of Libya, in just these terms.  Alas, Chomsky is too

   The same bullshit article reported that 22,5% of all the men have

Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health
insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like
socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary
insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition
has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,
including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,
you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.
With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and
be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The
public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount
for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or
according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of
French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health
costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other
taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures
for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure
for the U.S.

That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund
is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back
in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health
insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff
of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).

I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about
leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian
newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%
insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know
it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American
conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who
seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the
Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans
who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that
shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for
insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that
the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite
being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to
spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a
different culture.

"Managed Care" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western
nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France
and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says
of HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!").
Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling
doctors with budget strings.

In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France
and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public
hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions
are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked
"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by their
provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the
doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)

With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to
the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The
French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations
in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American
doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple
(early March).

Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French
and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical
monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they
must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the
U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis
E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.

Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's
health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one
small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.

Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany
case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public
sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra
insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward
accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal
benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care.

At that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.

It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when
working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only
annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda.

The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer
1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For
1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%
afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.
Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,
the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not
gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its
just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.

When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe
amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec
last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan.

that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees
were listed seperately on my pay stub.

While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ...
A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our
major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president
Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,
and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance
to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones
before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had
shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private
system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are
considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of
traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used
in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in
a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a
lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic
health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does
allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on
the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of
room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as

Please explain this one, hopefully in a way that Canadian readers
besides myself can understand and concur ...

                    INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT
                      BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF
                    KDKA-AM RADIO, PITTSBURGH

                 Pittsburgh International Airport
                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania



10:40 A.M. EDT


	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike
Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh
International Airport and with me is the President of the United
States Bill Clinton.

	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.

	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk
about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just
breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been
kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in
the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard
that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and
Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been
found not guilty.

	     It's a situation that's been building for over a
year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.
And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see
the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your
administration and what you're trying to do.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the
American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a
tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the
efforts of the federal government in developing the case.

	     The law under which the officers were tried is a
complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury
decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible
for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did
most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked
Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some
blows, and another officer who was a rookie.

	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but
it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They
acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think
that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But
I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:
first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country
together and not violate the civil rights of any American;
secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.

	     I think it's important to recognize that in the
poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this
country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're
even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our
efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police
officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a
waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some
other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to
violence and drugs.

	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to
me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic
revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed
areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles
who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many
problems as we do.

	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the
campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment
to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary,
Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies
for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest
unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the
country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to
the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several
other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with
regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.

	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the
Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a
lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.
You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you
said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break
that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to
Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that
battle?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First
of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported
me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in
economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it
gives the country a very different budget for the next five years
than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and,
at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and
health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.

	     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the
short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money
to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half;
to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also
to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The
plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the
Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a
bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come
to a vote.

	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote
for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican
leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to
stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases
the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending
targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for
this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five
years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the
economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that
are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for
billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --
much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.

	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.
I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I
think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work
right now to show that we're changing the direction of the
country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.

	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or
his office lately?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk
regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison
operation to the senators that we think are open to this --
Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords
from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six
others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and
know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life
of the budget I presented.

	     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've
got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth
is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life
of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we
have this program well below the spending targets that Congress
has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for
years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans
voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as
putting the American people back to work.

	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political
issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and
the need for jobs.

	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported
you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.
It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot
of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I
think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the
White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go
through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And
they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull
it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew
it was going to be like this.

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask
people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving
very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the
fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in
history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we
are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on
political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole
wide range of things.

	     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn
it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions
which led to the victory I received from the people in November,
and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making
real, real progress.

	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.
We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going
to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing
things.

	     Q	  Thank you very much.

	     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton,
here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely,
KDKA News.

                  RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION
                        BY THE PRESIDENT

                Pittsburgh International Airport
                    Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania


10:06 A.M. EDT


             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to
you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio
station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to
meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,
health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly
broadcast with the American people.

             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when
it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past
seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with
the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus
tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last
year's campaign.

             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with
you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and
what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting
to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.

             You sent me to Washington to get our government and
economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad
experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important
it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do
business.

             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations
rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness
of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the
cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,
labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the
industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've
made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which
our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them
have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been
falling behind.

             We have an economy today that even when it grows is
not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation
by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to
show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have
stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks
and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating
cost of health care.

             But we also know that, given the right tools, the
right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and
businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy
needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better
places to live.

             In many critical products today Americans are the
low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that
we create more of those kinds of jobs.

             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for
long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old
priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to
be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs
and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the
waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious
resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the
groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.

             These new directions passed the Congress in record
time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our
country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would
create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private
sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It
now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate.
But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the
Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know
would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.

             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people.
Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and
counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill
has been grounded by gridlock.

             I know the American people are tired of business as
usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin
or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have
taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra
mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25
percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.

             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million
Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill
languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean
hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to
act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking
this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I
think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant
portion of our original goals.

             First, we want to keep the programs as much as
possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,
including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young
people, immunization for children, construction of waste water
sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding
for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who
have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't
creating jobs.

             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs
in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40
percent.

             And third, I've recommended a new element in this
program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against
crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire
police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put
them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight
for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it
and deserve it.

             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --
the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it
increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this
year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,
doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more
than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this
budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the
Congress this year.

             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators
who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous
administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of
emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the
American people to work.

             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered
a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities
are -- on people or on politics.

             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar
for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the
soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our
children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs
and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of
us when we've helped make more American partners working to
ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.

             You know, if every American who wanted a job had
one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this
country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first
step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country
again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid
for over the life of our budget.

             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how
important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.

             Good morning, and thank you for listening.

                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT

 Not quite.  The answer is:  Many homosexuals, heterosexual, and bisexuals are,
but then, many are not.

 Or, more simply: Lots of people are.

It is a bit unfair to call blame the Clinton Administration alone...this
initiative was underway under the Bush Administration...it is basically
a bipartisan effort of the establishment Demopublicans and
Republicrats...the same bipartisan effort that brought the S&L scandal,
and BCCI, etc.

Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of
Civil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings
attached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that
verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or
innocence in a traditional sense, so be it. Being subjective rather than
objective may make it harder to anticipate what is right, and you may be
sacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while, but that really is a
small price to pay for the common good don't you think?

Last I checked I was one person, I haven't even been elected

Thats the point. If there are several million queers in DC you had better
start wondering about the validity of the study.

So if this study is proved wrong then it proves that heterosexuals
are liars? Unlike the propaganda spouted by the far right the ten
percent figure was backed up by the best study available at the time.
Its hardly certain that this new study is correct since it hasn't
even been out for enough time for any double checking to happen.

Of course if they had found 10% then it would be invalid because it
was funded by planned parenthood :)

Hyperlipidemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD).
Severe CAD has been observed in patients with normal levels of total and LDL cholesterol.
Small-dense LDL particle subtypes (LDL3 and LDL4) have been observed to be more oxidizable and atherogenic.
We aimed to identify the role of cholesterol particle subtypes in predicting CAD severity.

Anyone have any info. on the video/sound card from SIGMA designs.
It is called WIN STORM PC.
They also have another card called the legend 24lx

any info would be appreciated, incuding performance, pricing and
availability.
thanks

I can't see why you would not trust it because it is safer than any previous
compression programs. It integrates into the kernal and makes it nearly
impossible to delete.

I've seen this problem several times. It was always the result of the little 
rollers inside the mouse becomming dirty- they are good at collecting grime.
the solution is simple: remove the ball to reveal the two rollers. 
Carefully clean them and the ball.

I think you would need a DOS macro program.  Superkey (by Borland?)
comes to mind.  I don't think Windows is capable of sending
keystrokes to a DOS window.

What you want to do sounds like a security problem to me, though.

Does anyone know how to configure a DOS app in Progman
so that only one instance of it can be running at a time?

I'd really appreciate some help on how to do this.  I
would prefer responses through email if it's not a big 
deal, or at least through email _as well as_ posting.

Thank you!

PS Please E-mail me


Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", with
output as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript file
to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the
document at 600 dots per inch resolution.

I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from
an image processing program that can output images in Postscript.

Here's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv)
doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driver
does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the
menu is 300!  Not a really useful menu.

Any ideas?

posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.

This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota

-- begin SLIP.TXT --
Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here
are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the
Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring your Modem:

a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)
   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use
   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program
   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit
   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.
   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.

   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a
         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.

b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done
   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of
   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the
   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and
   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with
   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver
   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a
   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.
   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and
   batch file examples.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring the SLIP drivers:

There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available
CSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver
SLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver
SLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)
ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)
UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)

Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or
ETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:

a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART
b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others
   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a
   long FTP transfer.
c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode
d) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with
   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.

Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)
a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:
   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1
   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600
b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the
   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual
   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS
   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all
   use this virtual driver at 0x60.
   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in
   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.
   pktint.com

Instructions for SLIP8250.COM:
a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern
   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware
   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.
b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a
   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.
   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600
c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x
   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM
   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM
   pktint.com

Instructions for ETHERSL.COM:
If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You
will have to DELETE the line "device=*vcd" from the [386Enh] section
of SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm
applications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped
characters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not
recommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:
   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring Windows 3.1:

a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]
   section.
   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.
       COM1Base=03F8
       COM1Irq=4
       COM2Base=02F8
       COM2Irq=3
       COM3Base=03E8
       COM3Irq=5
       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,
       but double-clicking on the "Ports" icon.
   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer
       COM1Buffer=10000
   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish
       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that
       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to
       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch
       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value
       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.
       COM1AutoAssign=0
       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.
       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under "Device Contention", set
       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to
       "Never Warn"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional notes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each
SLIP session?

I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user
a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI
each time that I establish a SLIP connection.

If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,
please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the
configuration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP
will not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a
situation such as this, you must do the following:

Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:

[net]
name=
ip=
netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)
arptime=20
packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)

Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file
"attrib +r qvtnet.ini"

Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address
that you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the
general configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and
IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],
and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not
be saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.

A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address
assignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)
Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.
Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a
file called "myip".  Another file "noip" is essentially a complete
QVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step "myip"
and "noip" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of
Victor's batch file is provided below:
=====================================================
slipper com2
pktint.com
bootpq -i "ip=\"%%s\""  >> myip
bootpq -i "My IP# is: %s"
copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini
del /q myip
@echo off
echo .
echo Ready to run WinQVTnet
=====================================================
For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor
Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)

QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?

PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes
immediately if used with ETHERSL.COM

PKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet
simulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:

The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you
use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with
applications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).

[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]

lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)
lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)
lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)
lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)
pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)

Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within
Windows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is
directed to the file "popmail.bat".  This is what popmail.bat reads
like:

pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60
cd \popmail
popmail
cd \
pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60
exit                    causes the DOS window to close

I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications
like PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS
sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example
within two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for
Gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each
instance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?

I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with
a reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these
conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and
being used as follows:
a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session
b) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session
c) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS

I get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring
compressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with
SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session
is active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session
is active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same
files.

While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,
for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the
performance hit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode

In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the
applications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications
that required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3

When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,
I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads
"IP:incorrect packet type" or "IP:bad version number".  This does not
seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on
loss of performance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with
C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?

In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with
C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --
Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him
know.  Chances are that he can fix it.

In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is
kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2

(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)

I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate
ETHERSL.COM

This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a
packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box
at a time.

So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a
medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library
of Medicine).

ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP
cd \gm6
search
cd \
termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP
exit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows

If you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have
any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing
the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no
problem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no
problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3

How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?

The quick answer -- there is no "clean" way.  Below is a batch file
hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this
example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a
batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you
plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,
port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,
CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory
or in your path ...

All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection
using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the
connection, and unload the driver when you are done ...

I am having a really bothersome problem using the MSDOS prompt in Windows 3.1
to open a dos box.  When I am done with the dos box, I cant get back to windows.
If I do Alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goes
black and I have to control-alt-delete until I kill windows.  I get a couple
of screens about app not responding.

I think things are still alive under the black screen because if I alt-tab
to cycle through the running apps, I get flashes of text but then the
black returns.

This persists even if the machine is powered on and off.

I am working with an app developed using Borland's 3.1 application frameworks
and c++.  It seems to work fine.

Hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network.  Video is a TSENG 
vga.  dos 5.0.

I reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back.  I am
using temporary swapping for virtual memory.

I would really REALLY appreciate any hints anyone might offer.

Thanks,

Jim Cant

Well, this is *only* a guess:  If it goes by the "true" meaning of "bit
map", then it holds (x,y,c) where x pixel number in th ex-direction, y:
pixel-number in the y-dir, c: colour.

        I am having something very unusual happen.  First 
some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, 
and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on 
it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician 
Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by 
having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is 
necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, 
and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard 
drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad 
sectors a week.
 
        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with 
an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this 
message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program 
and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining 
for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about 
sectors for a brief period of time.
 
        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the 
exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the 
same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went 
to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough 
there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, 
but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, 
either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the 
cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.
 
        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix 
them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are 
no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other 
files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them 
for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to 
completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through 
the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.
 
        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on 
my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in 
about every 100 files are affected.  
 
        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s 
system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about 
smartdrv to help me out.

It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important
than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it.
If someone made a voice recognition/multimedia (sound) oriented program,
it would probably been more effective.  I don't know what the original
purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question
though.

I had this problem when I initially installed my sound blaster pro and here's
what the tech support told me.

They told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from
the win31 subdirectory of the soudblaster directory. Now look in the system.ini
file and if any of them say device=xxxxxxx.386 than change it to 
device=*xxxxxxx
Thats should work. Was your system.ini file erased for some reason? That would
be the only reason that I would think that Windoes is giving you the error now.



Where can I obtain TrueType hiragana and katakana (Japanese phonetic character)

Why is Win 3.1 sometimes so finicky?
I have a new DELL 486DX2/66mhz  8 megs RAM.
Windows was working just great.  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem.
DELL replaced the mouse, gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard.  Just prior to this problem windows would
]only load up every other time.  I would get the LOGO and either it would
go on into windows or LOCK UP.  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME.

Now with the new motherboard and all, it still does the same thing.
The computer is less than one month old.  At first it worked FINE!
I can get into windows each time now with the   win/s command.
This forces Standard mode.  Things seem to run slower.  I mainly
use windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem.....
plus it is slower.

I re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing.  Should I first delete
everything in all windows dir's?  I did not because I have so much 
added in sub dir's etc.

Really puzzling why ENHANCED MODE would not load each time but consistently
every other time.  Standard mode each time......

ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ???

Lines: 18

I've been running Dos 6 for about a month.  I was generally impressed with
the improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, the
new commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow for
large data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv).

Until now.

This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper, I had to
reboot a hung Dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within Windows 3.1.
When my machine finished rebooting, I found my windows directory and about two
thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.

I cannot afford problems like this.  I'm returning to Dos 5.

mark

P.S.  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should
      exist.

I do not know of any "VGA" type cards that have BNC outputs but, EXTRON
sells a VGA to BNC cable set that works good with my 5FG.  If you are
trying to optimize the display with a good video card try contacting #9,

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and
characters on each side, which is useless.

I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.
Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however!!

Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? 

Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF?

We are using pkzip V2.04 and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these.

Which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst

Is there a full windows version that does not call the DOS

Come on fellows! The format is quite plainly explained in the manuals.
It's in the "Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures,

manuals) pages 232-241 (depending what you need).

First there is the BITMAPFILEHEADER-struct then the BITMAPINFO which
contains the BITMAPINFOHEADER and the RGBQUAD and then the bitmap
data. AND there is also a example among the example files (MS_SDK).

Hello again,

About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the
Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people
asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I
received.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have
not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so
you can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an
unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a
wide range of comments, each has its own value.  

There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its
price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability
of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new
printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around
summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first
inkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of
re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely
depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets
(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,
that's a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!

Well I bought the BJ 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebate
program on that printer (it ends 5/31), and I bought it from Computer
Discount Warehouse because their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywhere I
looked, and I think it's a HOT printer.  Just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the
output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my
BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed
how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was
several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the
HP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).

I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders
too.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY
was two days.

Good luck!

I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using
TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for
the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy
paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality
'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find
copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows
driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few
'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType
but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless
the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges
can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.

For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via
the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as
'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The
range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general.

>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.

However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
Epson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing
laser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX
- something I think?

I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The
introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.
 
===========================================================================

About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is
incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever
do stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from
Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had
are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on
cheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you
can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve
inches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The
printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other
complaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for
those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.
The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it
between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine
from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend
who has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone
has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!

Hope I helped!

(360dpi sure looks great!)

  I guess I have some experience with both: I have a BJ-300 at work and a
Deskjet 500 at home.  I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality
are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet
for home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM
Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be
the case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.

  Just my $0.02 worth..

  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not
present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the
translation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the
note.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around
the paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics
resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:
Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and
could not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.
I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no
comparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration
the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.

I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I
spent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at
work this month anyway.

===========================================================================

I spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet
BJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:

1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon
2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference
3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.

The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the
BJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.

As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything
big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I
know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the
printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with
the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one
comes from - Microsoft?)

Hope this helps.

Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-))
I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better,
but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at
least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in
other "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently
available..

I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me
Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one
with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in
printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better..

===========================================================================

When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to
inkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.
We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling
qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print
quality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end
up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are
using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out
of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and
that was taken care of very quickly by HP.

===========================================================================

Whenever I buy anything I look at what the "experts" say, pick out the top
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been
unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a
few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.

I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three
reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I
bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build
a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner
towards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I
tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the
result.

I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour
and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still
readily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my
views/experience:

	1.	I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away
		from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with
		the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.

	2.	I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the
		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes
		they have the expertise.

	3.	The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly
		acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from
		Windows.

	4.	I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured
		typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)
		and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is
		pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...

	5.	The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.

	6.	If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty
		slow with it, God knows what it's like without!

I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily
use.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and
having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.

Hope this is of use.

===========================================================================

Just bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with
$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the
DeskJet in print quality.

Speed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures).
         I don't print long docs, though.

Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is
         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up
         close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a LaserJet.
         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the
         page/print head in place, I would imagine.

Large docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...
         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.

Drivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn't want to print
         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.

Know nothing of add-on costs.

I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the
sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The
BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare
it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (
depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not
being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since
Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.

Wow, it's funny you should ask this.  I'm a little behind in news reading
so I know this may be late.

  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried
that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is
fantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it
printed DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless you
get 2 inches from the page.

  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette
which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it
under Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to
install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them.

  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut
I felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won't
say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.  Just my
$0.02 worth.

I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most
EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA
counterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is
only about as "fast" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't
what I would call "fast."

I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the
same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits.

Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher
cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than
and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a
Diamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report,
I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's
around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow
me to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and still
have $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother-
board too...)

Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?

Yep, you can use any type of UNIX, or maybe VMS, or buy a MAC or something...
  If you want longer filenames for your documents, I heard of a wordprocessor for
windows which let you assign long names to files. Those long filenames could only be
seen from that programs open/save dialogs though... Maybe someone knows more about
this wordprocessor than I do?

Sounds like a memory conflict problem, which can cause truly weird symptoms 
like these. Call Dell tech support (or better, post to them on CSERVE if you
have an account) and get the memory range(s) used by video RAM on your
machine. The block windows from using those ranges with an
EMMEXCLUDE= statement in the 386Enh section of SYSTEM.INI. You probably
should include a statement excluding the same range from EMM386 or whatever
memory manager you use in CONFIG.SYS.

Dell "installs" Windows on the machines they ship, but the installation doesn't
consist of much more than  copying the files to a hard disk. You still have
to do the work. And the fact that you have the problem in Enhanced
mode but not standard strongly suggests a high memory conflict.

Seriously, add program manager to your startup group and define a
shortcut for it. Works.

Hi,

I use a PC with a screen access program (IBM Screen Reader) and a
speech synthesizer. (Accent SA).

I would like to find out about screen access programs for the windows
platform.  I heard that were a couple of them out now under beta
testing, I would like to find out addresses/prices etc.

Thanks,

I am getting desperate. I have a report that must be finished by midnight,
and W4W doesn't seem to have what appears to be a MUST! I use the autonum
field for numbering chapters, but my document is distributed amongst
several files. I just can't find a way to make Word start the numbering
at something else than 0 or 1. Of course, everything is fine in the first
file, but it's pretty stupid when ALL chapters are numbered as 1 !!!!!!!!

Please, if you have ANY solution to this (except from putting it all in
one 10M document ...) e-mail me immediately !
As I am working on th report I hardly have any time to read News, so
please e-mail me. All answers will be heartly welcome ...

In advance, thanx a lot !!!!!!

Title says it all: I'm in need of a Truetype OEM character set font - ie
one that contains the line drawing and other characters in the PC 
character set similar to those you get when running a text mode application.

If anyone could point me at such a thing, I'd be grateful.

[The only OEM fonts included with Windows are not Truetype.]

Regards,

You CAN print to a file from an HP (or any other printer).  Just go into
the Printers section of your Control Panel.  Select the printer you want
to re-direct to a file, and click on Connect.  Then choose :FILE as the
port to connect the printer to.

When you print from any application to that printer, Windows will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the
printout.

It's pretty easy.

Good luck!

Dos 5 never used the area $E000 - $EFFF, as well as some others. If you have 
any cards that use this are (such as a LAN card), you might get this 
problem.

Use the X=$E000-$EFFF in your EMM386.EXE line in config.sys. If you run 
MemMaker then instruct it retain inclusions and exclusions.

   Anyone know of a good software package that will allow us to keep track of
who is printing what and when?  Is there any way to get Print Manager to keep
a log?  Is there a Print Manager replacement that will do this?  How about a
package that will only allow access to the system for people in a password 
file?  I looked at Chastity, but it will let you log in without a password,
and doesn't keep tabs of who got on and when.  
   Any help will be greatly appreciated.

This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago. My HD was stacked
with Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of
the HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with
'funny' names). In other words: it is probably just the doubledisk part of
Dos6 that is troublesome. 

I now use Stacker v 3.0, and so far I have had no trouble.

Hi everybody out there,
I just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of WindowsNT
and still am not able to boot up that system. The final step
achieved is the display of IO-error 0x0069. But, since this is
the beta release of the SDK for NT and not of NT, Microsoft does
not include a manual on the OS itself, explaining what this
error means of what I can do to get rid of. My configuration
is: 
Mainboard     Hauppauge 4860-25, rev. A7 (a 486 with socket for i860)
              28megs of memory (512k*36,1M*36,2M*36)
AMI EISA SCSI controller (15series), latest bios, 16MB cache 
              ST41200N hard disk
              Syquest 555 removable disk
              Toshiba 3301 CD ROM drive
ProAudio Spectrum Plus 16
Longshine Ethernet card LCS8634 (NE2000 comp.)
ET4000 graphics card, 1Meg (ColorImage5)
The system is running fine under DOS and Windows 3.1 etc, but
trying to do the setup for NT,
- automatic setup does not recognize controller (AHA1542-compat.)
  when adding manually, NT complains not finging any CD-ROM drive
- the manual setup (WINNT) does not copy everything from CD to HD,
  does not recognize controller, but takes it manually.
  Setup continues until it tries to boot. Then it starts loading
  several stuff from disk (seems to fing the HD), but messing up
  with that damned IO-Error 69.
I took away all IO cards not essential, but that did not make any
effect.
Anybody got any ideas? Help would be greatly appreciated.

Here is another hint:

	I have a really jumping mouse (ps2 type), and finally the mouse
stops jump changing HIMEM.SYS (yes, himem!), is you use:

DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS /M:x

x can be 1,2,...,8 (Of course my computer DON'T appear on the list for
these parameter)

 And maybe, your mouse can stop jump... (But your problem looks more
like a dirty mouse ;)...

	Hope it help (to anybody!)

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS
6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out
that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a
number of folks problems.

MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).

Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned
on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50, 
for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  I want to see
the MS spin doctors explain this.

This pretty much confirms my original impression after reading
through the documentation on dos-6.  The double space sounds nice,
but NOT on your primary disk!!  I'll probably wind up making a
disk partition d: and doublespacing *it*, using it as an archive.
Probably would be useful on floppy disks as well.  But on c:?  Uh, uh...

[I particularly disliked the note that said something like "double
space is irreversible"].

I recently set Windows 3.1 up on my 486DX-33 VLB system, and I didn't
notice until last night that I don't have the 386 icon in my control
panel.  I don't remember Windows setup asking me about 386 enhanced
mode (whether I wanted it or not).  Now I've got a program that I 
just bought (Aldus Freehand 3.1) that is telling me that I should be
running Windows in enhanced mode (looks like I'm running in standard
mode).

How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie?  Are
there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows
to not want to give you enhanced mode? 

Thanks for any help!!

 I thought I'd reply to this, though I ain't brad.  AT any case, a lot
of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to
.bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop
(shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think,
where VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I"ll
post a corection).


This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you
have to rename it.

NOW, another thing....
this is from the windows' FAQ:

your file has to be less than 64 K
( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than
about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know).

Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size
is.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a
way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,
such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about
this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the
filename). 

ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.

These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory.

Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your
new win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from a
directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of
the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.


Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).

Well, I got  WINZIP from cica (don't know which version, but I think
it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and I was initially imressed.
But here's the low-down:

WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you
vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a
/checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you want
to check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on
exit, if you didn;t like the program.

*HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't
konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I
"zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something
or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit
all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know
(as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do,
now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd)
but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip
file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.
I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.

Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful "unzip"ing
functions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new
ver.  (as for now, a good old, "run-->unzip *.zip" will work.

(PS> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).

peace,
Mickey

Speaking of that.....
My comp has "emmexclude=$e000-$efff" or something of that nature in the
system.ini file.  Or some system file for *windows*.

I was just wondering if having that line in a *windows* startup file is
better, as it will give some more memory on dos apps., but disable it
when you run windows?

(Actually, I *do* think that that line is also in the system.1 file)

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but I've used the
shareware program, PaintShop, to convert between the two.  You can download
it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called
or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try
scanning the index files).

To convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a
"Save as..."  Select "Windows bitmap" and "Compressed" (or is it "RLE"?)
Whatever it is, it's fairly intuitive...

Sorry I don't have all the details, but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb
terminal and can't do much researching...Good luck!

    This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help.

    I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.

    When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many
    of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT
    2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when
    I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under
    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than
    my shell running.

    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some
    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  

    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are
    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at
    plugging this leak?

    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?

    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with
    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.

    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was
    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different
    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)

    5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less
    likely my code will eat resources?

    6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for
    specifically?

    Thanks for your help.  As this is a common problem and I have seen only
    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
    me email.

I'm new to the MS-Windows world, and while a fairly competent
Sparc/Nextstep programmer, I have no idea which development kit
to purchase.  I have heard good things about Borland C++ with
Application Frameworks and Microsoft's Visual C++ with SDK (?)

What I would like is peoples comments on which package or set
of tools they find useful or productive and why.  There are a
plethora of other kits such as GUI toolkits available and I'm
wondering which of these are best in terms of reliability, plug
and go type operation, readability and so on.  I'd be interested
in comments on these or anything else you may find useful.

I will summarize to the net if there is enough interest.

Hello.
      I have Windows 3.1 and I was wondering what is necessary to change the
default system font to something else.  I have just obtained MSC/C++ 7.0 with
SDK, so I'd really like to get my feet wet with doing my first windows pro-
gram to change the system font.

Ok, I just got a new 486/66 16 Mb, with a ATI Ultra pro and I can't get
into windows. It says that I need more memory available, but I have 15mb
ogf extended mem & 512k of conventionnal. I have disabled my memory aperture
because it didn't find any "FREE" memory, but it still gave me a message that
the memory aperture will conflict with system memory. I think that's why
it want to get in Windows.

Any help will greatly be appriciated.

Hi, folks,

I have a question:

        How can I generate a PCX file using Word for Windows (2.0) ?

I know I can select a Postscript printer driver to get a PS file, but how
can I generate a PCX file ? Is there a printer capture utility for windows
that ever exists ? Or a utility to transfer PS format to PCX format, or
TIFF format?

Please reply by E-MAIL, I will give a summary. Thanks.

I saw an ad for this and it basically is an advanced print manager...
it lets you monitor your printing more closely and comes with a bunch of

Recently, Windows has starting giving me the error "Sound Blaster Pro:
Requires newer version of Windows 3.1."  It has worked correctly for a long
time, and don't know what the problem could be.  Thanks!

I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows
from a Novell administrator's point of view.
 
I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they
(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,
the LOCAL setup (described below) as the "most advantageous installation".
If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.
 
The LOCAL Windows Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the
resources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation,
he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.
Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers
are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.
 
Advantages:
- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to
  the local access of main Windows files.
- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point
  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing
  and reduce the cost of down-time.
- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard
  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network
  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster
  access than local ones.
- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about
  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the
  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.
 
Disadvantages:
- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk
  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can
  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.
- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to
administer.
  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of
  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.
- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system
  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for
  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.
- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup
  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.
  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be
  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable
  applications and *not* user data.
 
The SHARED Windows Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure
described above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of
files to individual "user" directories.  These directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network "home" directory.  The bulk of the
Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory
(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout
their Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include
group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.
 
Advantages:
- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As
  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this
  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.
- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,
  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct
  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.
- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files
  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with
  all driver updates.
 
Disadvantages:
- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network
  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the
  speed of Windows.
- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's
  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs
  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will
  usually not be able to save their work.
- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files
  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a
  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows
  files alone.
- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation
  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being
  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).
  
The Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows
userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have
setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money.
 
I would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should
apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how
Windows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy
backup and administration but this is "putting all eggs in one basket";
if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.
 
Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to
hear from people with "actual" working experience with users and network
administration.

	Path of least resistance (TM) :) :
Get WinGIF 1.4 from cica (ftp.cica.indiana.edu pub/pc/win3/(desktop?) )
It will save to native .rle format unlike PSP (an otherwise fine, fine prog)
Make a file using anything that has to be less than 30k, as Michael said,
and less than 16 colors... Import it to WinGIF as gif, pcx or bmp and
save it in you windows/system subdir as vgalogo.rle (NOT .lgo). Exit Win,
and run setup in the windows subdir. Reselect your _current_ config. Run
Win. Voila'
(minor correction: the .rle file has to be <30k. that means ~15k gif ?)
Hope it helps... (and please, please someone put this in the group's FAQ)

	WinZip 4.0 (ftp.cica.indiana.edu:pub/pc/win3/(util?) ). It is
a shell (it DOES call DOS ), but a very, very good one. It will also
do arc, arj and lzh. It fully supports PKZIP 2.04 . Try using it...
It might be a shell --very unobtrusive--, but that also means you dont
need to update it with every every-other-letter-of-the-alphabet version
of PKZIP... :)
Hope it helps....

Subject: TCP/IP through Windows 3.1
Lines: 52

I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question:

CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the
         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my
         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it
         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone
         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that
         I type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the DOS
         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then
         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon
         screen. "TELNET" and "TN3270" are the names of batch files in my SLIP
         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the
         session.

PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I
         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I
         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that
         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me
         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to
         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)
         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP
         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP
         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-
         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when
         that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often
         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center
         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to
         them with more questions.

QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows
         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too
         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that
         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost
         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:

         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1
         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation
         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the
            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp
            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about
            that.

         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true
         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under
         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently
         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet
         session and other applications.

Any information received is appreciated.

Yes Russ, there is. 
QuinZip is a Windows version but I don't think it handles
all the functions available in the DOS version.

Last I looked QuinZip could be found on the Monash University (Australia)
mirror site of Cica, so I'd assume it's still on Cica itself
and other mirrors.

Have a look in the /util(s?) directory for a file called
qzip21.zip.

I am interested to know if there is know procedure/document to
configure an IBM Musci Feature (IMF) card to work as the sound device
with MS-Windows 3.1.  I believe the IMF uses the same FM synth chip as
the Soun Blaster, but didn't know what driver to use or how to
configure the MIDI-mapper.

Any help, past success, suggestions?

Thanks,

I believe you have the correct files. I think what you'll have to
do is go back into Setup and choose change video adapter or
whatever it is called. Then the trick is choose the same adaptor
you currently have. What Setup does is it actually changes the
file WIN.COM whenever you go into it and change the video
hardware selection. It incorporates the contents of VGALOGO.RLE
into WIN.COM when you do this. This trick can also be used to
change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be.

Has anyone observed this?  If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP
file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5") under MS Windows 3.1 via either
Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell 
has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not.

The corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip -t b:\file.zip" after 
both copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption.


Now here's the kicker:


I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps.
Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the 
DOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).


So, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running,
and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this 
scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows
apps and one slice for the running DOS app.  

When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks
are essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and
95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = 
.72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. 

When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell
(no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task
manager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice
(assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: 
(1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time.

So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU
time?  Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy 
copy?  It must be!

Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane!

I have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears
to be memory-related.  It's actually not limited to windows, but
that's where it causes most of my problems.  Ths machine's 486DX33,
8Meg RAM, 256Kcache, TRIDENT TVGA card, PAS-16 soundcard.

1)  Windows runs REALLY, REALLY slow most of the time.  Slower than
on my old 386SX16.  Graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow,
applications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear.
(Note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things that
appear to be related.  Several run slow, my .mod player crashes the
system etc..)

2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other
programs)  COMPLETELY fixes the problem.  Windows will run as fast as
I've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than
when I don't run BC beforehand.

3)  I don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys.  Installing
emm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse.  After emm386 is
installed, running BC will not fix the problem anymore.

This problem is driving me nuts.  If you think you can help,
please reply through the mail.
Thanks,
Evan

Do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the DOS display and then back or 
create a temp. DOS window?

If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  I'm afraid 
I don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it.

It's fully compatible with ver. 2.04g and very functional.

I've had the same problem with a Maxtor 7213A.  Turned off
smartdrive, 32 bit disk access, etc.  This same disk aborts
Norton Speed Disk (NU 4.5), up to 8 times, requesting NDD to be
run when attempting to defrag drive.  At Some peoples' suggestion
I reformatted my drive and reloaded DOS 5.0, Win 3.1 from
scratch.  A few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1
beta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem, So I tried this
drastic solution.  When the problem reoccurred, I didn't have the
brains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive.

I get arround the annoyance by copying my *.grp files to *.gro.
when I get the message, I run file manager and copy the
offeniding group files from *.gro ove rthe *.grp.  Then I quit
and restart windows(If the group is an often used important one.)

This really sucks.  But I'm pretty sure that the problem is the
drive (especially with the NSD problem).  I will be going with
out over 66% of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks, while
the guy I bought the disk and system from, goes over it and
either fixes it or replaces the drive.  I can't wait to have a
system that will run consistently with all hte goodies!

It's the applications that do this.  Unfortunately, even the applets
that ship with Win31 seem to have this problem (I've seen it in
Solitaire, for example).

None that I know of.  If an application doesn't give back the
resources, they are lost and gone forever, pending a restart of
Windows.

If the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them
don't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do
about it.

No.  This is a problem with the applications, usually.

There are books written on this one.  In general, just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit.  Unfortunately, I
understand that VB will *internally* lose resources for you, so
there's no way to avoid this entirely.

There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages
to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on
the resource pool.

When I use File Manager's disk copy, I find that
Windows (3.1) can read the whole 1.2MB disk at one time, 
but only 98% of a 1.44 disk. It looks like a problem
of memory. However, The PC has 4MB RAM. There should be some 
way to allocat more extended memory for disk copy. 
Please advise me on this matter. Thanks in advance.

Could you add some information to 'Non it does not'.
Say for instance your source of information.

Thanks.

You bet your bippy it's built like a tank.. and not just mechanically either!

This past weekend we had a nasty thunderstorm and the impossible (*&^%)
happened - I got a direct lightning strike on my house - and to the second
floor outlet box into which my faithful DeskJet 500C was connected. There
was a .303-bullet-sized hole in the aluminum siding with some solidified
aluminum slag dripping from it. You could actually see the electrical box
through the hole! The outlet itself was fried and I'm still amazed the
whole damn house didn't burn down.

I lost 2 electric garage door openers,  2 vcr's, 2 telephones (all of which
were on the opposite side of the house), a ZyXEL U-1496E high speed modem,
a VGA monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the RS232 and parallel ports on my
X terminal and a WD LAN card in my PC. Not a good night!

But, the DeskJet ran as soon as I found a functioning serial and parallel
port to connect to it.

    Hi,
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's "Plug-in" for Program Manager.
      Its listed in most BBS'es as PLUGIN13.  Its an add-on which gives
      some needed features to Progman; such as the ability to better
      manage your groups, change your cursor and icons on the fly,
      constant status of RAM and resources, "Quick-menu" (a drop-down
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher), plus some other neat stuff.
      Used it, liked it, and even reg'd it <G>.

      If you can't find it anywhere, let me know and I'll zip it up and
      mail it to you (shareware version, of course <g>...)

Aloha...

Please do not do this!

I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I
subscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a
huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for
the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K
modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. 
Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. 
Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I
didn't want in the first place.

If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other
ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like
ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell
people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like
alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives
rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size.

The sensitivity is changed using the /S, /V, or /H parameter.  
The commands do the following:
/V - vertical sensitivity
/H - horizontal sensitivity
/S - both 

Follow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 (1 - slowest, 100-fastest).
The default is 50.  You can type the command "mouse /S75" right from the
keyboard or add it to autoexec.bat.

Hope this helps.

Does this need to have anything to do with disk compression? I have 
experienced the same thing a couple of times myself, but *without* any disk 
compression stuff installed. (For example, guess what happened when Norton 
SpeedDisk once crashed during defragmenting!)

Good question.
Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?)
        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus.
        I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.
        The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but
        they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.
        So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at
        33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.
        So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on
        a 33 mhz cpu.  EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as
        fast as ISA.

That's a very good question.  The EISA bus does have more advantages
over the ISA bus than just it's width.  For example: more/better 
interrupts and bus mastering.  But these other factors do not impact
 a video card very much.  They have more impact on file servers with 
multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.

Source for "does not" comment: the CD-ROM and manuals for the March beta
-- there *is* no X windows server there.

Will there be?  Of course.  (Even) if Microsoft supplies one with NT,
other vendors will no doubt port their's to NT.

According to a recent newsletter from Hummingbird Communications Ltd.,
they announced eXceede/NT at UNIFORUM 93.  The announcement reads like it
is "here now", but there is no order or price info.  I would guess it
must be RSN.  There is a dev kit too.

Regarding the horror stories about DOS6/DOUBLEDISK and STACKER 2.?
killing hard drives:

I was wondering if the dos 6 MIRROR command works on the doubled
drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table.
If it records the vital DoubleDisk info, then using it daily
should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the
type of catastrophic failure discussed.  If it doesn't, then
shame on Microsoft.

Hi,

	I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988
keyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching).
It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause
the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386
enhanced mode.  This occurs in Norton Desktop, File Manager, and when
trying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.

	Has anyone run into this?  Any ideas?  Much thanks appreciated.

I friend of mine installed dos6 at work and is hooked up to a Novell
network, running Netware 386 v.3.11.  The problem he's having is that the
doublespace program is using drive 'h' as the swap drive, which is
confliting with the networks mapped drives.

Is there switch to place the swap drive to someother drive?
Please e-mail....thanks a bunch!!

I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  
Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track 
Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.

First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  
are.

What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  
IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  
be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there?

Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  
got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  
why I should load this driver?

Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.

On my PC I almost exclusively run windows. The only dos based application  
I have is ProcommPlus.  In my config.sys I have emm386 loaded with the  
option noems (no expanded memory). Following a thread in one of the comp  
newsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded. Indeed,  
in the manual, it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of  
extended memory. Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the  
emm386 device is useless in my case. 

Should I use emm386 or should I remove it from my config.sys?

Thanks for your help,

	Sombody's data is wrong.  Since Mac OS, Finder, Systerm
or whatever you want to call it doesn't appear in the first 
survey, I tend to doubt their results more.  Just because
sombody wrote it doesn't mean its correct.

Keep the swap file on the IDE.  32-bit access is worth a fair amount more
than 13%.

One of our users is having an unusual problem.  If she does an Alt/Tab to
a full-screen DOS program, when she goes back to Windows her desktop fonts
have changed.  If she goes back to a full-screen DOS program and then goes
back to Windows, the font has changed back to its default font.  It's not
a major problem (everything works and the font is legible), but it is
annoying.  Does anyone have any idea why this happens.  By the way, she
has a DEC 486D2LP machine.

A friend and I have ATI Graphic Ultra display adaptors, and they have
been reasonably good performers, but we both have had irritating compatibility
problems with the ATI drivers and are ready to change to something faster
and more compatible with windows. I have heard rumblings that the new Orchid
9000 card is very fast. Anyone have experience with this card? What is
currently available that is fast, compatible, does 1280x1024x256 non-

emm386 noems enables the system to use the "upper memory" between 640 and 
1024.  That's a good place for device drivers, DOS kernal, etc.

Microsoft is the largest software company on the planet, yet I cannot think
of even *ONE* computing concept that they innovated and brought to market
before anyone else.  Xerox-PARC/Apple, Osborne, NeXT, GNU and others have 
been pioneers and led the way to the future of computing.  What has
microsoft done to be a technological leader?  I posted this question before,
but I got nary a reply.  I make the challenge now to anyone who can come up
with something-especially Microsoft employees.  I get no response this time,
I guess it pretty much assures me that there is none--which is what I
suspect anyway.

Really when you come down to it who cares. I just hope MS keeps doing

Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
config.sys  If you are using W4WW you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space.  Reboot and Novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys.  You might have to remap some
of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives.  Make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set
to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).

Hi.
I'd like to substitute the exciting win3.1 opening logo for our own
company logo at boot up time. Is this a matter of replacing the logo
file with our own logo? And what format should the company logo be
in? Thanks.

Development of what?  In-house apps?  Maybe, but  certainly not apps
to be sold on an open market.  Statistics like that are laughable,
because they may simply mean that there are not enough shrink-wrapped
usable apps for UNIX and they have to be developed disproportionately
often as compared to the installed UNIX base.

Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing
what it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright
and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and
other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to
be one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in
like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,
marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all
that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since
they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the
Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over
antitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who
have a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who
can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from
the original innovator, I feel much sympathy.

     I know that I've seen this question asked before, but I don't remember
seeing any answers..So here it is again:

     Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD90C31 driver might reside?
I've checked cica, and I'm sure it's not there (I'm refering to the new
version of the driver that came out in 2(?)/93).  I have seen it on c-serve,
but I hesitate to d/l 1 meg. at 2400 bps unless I really have to!
     Alternativly, is it possible to get Paradise (or WD) to mail me the new
drivers, or don't they do that.

     Finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is
there not much improvement over my 10/92 version?

                             Thanks for the info,
                                    Peter

Admit it BillG is a damn smart guy. How many out there can make money on 
almost useless products...Useless even if you look at the time Dos were 
written..it stinked already then..

If I could choose one marketing guy in the world, I think I would choose 
him. He's so good that almost everyone hates him, but they still use his 
stuff...

I have the text on the non-Un*x X11 servers, so I do know that there are
X11 servers available for use with MSWindows 3.1.  My question is, does
anybody have any relevant information on the usability of these servers?
Has anyone tried to use them on a Token Ring network and gotten them to
work?

The IBM XGA SVGA VESA driver is on the 2.02 reference diskette, available
from the IBM BBS.  It's also on Compu$erve, or you can bang on your sales
rep to get you a later version.

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer
to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename
that you want to create. I've found that putting a line in system.ini in the
ports section with just a path and filename works. The only problem is that
if you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.

I'm looking for a good terminal program that will connect to
TCP/IP using windows. Some basic MS-Window that is connect to
a unix host would be great.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Lets see... what MS products don't have major bugs in them?  Oh, but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up, even if their
customers must buy new "releases" from them that are little more than
bug fixes.  Anyone who buys a $2500 computer system and then runs MS
Windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.  

Oh wait! MS innovated the plastic housing on the MS mouse---didn't
they?  "Logitech Inside"

You can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company
gathers together a bunch of knock-off packages and peddles them to
neophytes.  If MS does anything, it appears someone has to do it
first.  It appears that MS is finding out that throwing money at
technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution.

I've been using Windows NT (tm) since the October release, and I have to 
say that the March release is really a big improvement.  Windows NT (tm)
is becomming usable.

There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.
First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.
What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other
resourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  
And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone
knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), 
please let me know.

The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.
For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster
(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't 
produced drivers yet.

Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and
give the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever
you wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into
Windows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.

Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows
though.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should
really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work
well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never
heard of anyone else who did either.

It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the
box, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity.

I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint
of heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta.

I have a copy.  It isn't in there.  Microsoft says it will not be in
the release version, either.  He just asked if it did or not.  I told
him.

Take a look at WinQVT/net -- the latest version is QVT/net 3.4
It comes in versions that are direct to packet driver, as well as a PC NFS 
version.

It is priced quite low; registration = $40, student registration = $20, and is 
a nice package -- comes complete with VT220 terminal emulation, FTP, POP3 
client, LPR, and NNTP client.

You can FTP it from "biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu" /pub/qvtnet/qvtnet34.zip

It was also uploaded to ftp.cica.indiana.edu recently.

The problem is that QuinZip is very very slow.  So I think that WinZip 4.0
is still the best choice to use pkzip in Windows!

COM files are limited to a total size of 64KB.  Thus, win.cfn plus vgalogo.log 
plus your RLE file must be less than 64KB.  Thus, your RLE file should be 
around 30KB.

Note that the two tables don't talk about the same population.  One is
Fortune 1000 companies favoring the platform as their primary
application platform, the other is sales (to everyone, not just
Fortune 1000).  Fortune 1000 companies don't do a lot of development
with the Mac as their top platform.  I would expect that that would
explain the discrepancy.

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board.  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I
would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  

So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
not.

Well, I thought that highmem.sys would do that too. I just took out emm386  
of my config.sys, and I'm still loading my other drivers high (mouse, vga  
shadow bios, dos-key etc.) I haven't checked mem/c, but I believe I have  
managed to load them high (ie between 640KB and 1024KB).

Also, ever since I took out emm386, windows loads slightly faster, I get  
about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows (I'm running 386 enhanced with 4  
Meg RAM, 7 Meg swap) and I got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem  
(before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl-alt-del after exiting  
windows). 

I would really like to keep emm386 out of my config.sys. Anybody else have  
info on this???

If it's any consolation, I had a similar problem. As I recall, if I exited
from a DOS session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a
scrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that). It only
started happening after I used IconTitleFaceName in WIN.INI to change the
desktop font to Arial. So I stopped exiting from DOS sessions while in
full-screen mode.

My Mac used to do something similar. Aren't computers weird?

Generally, the second or third major release usually takes care of it.
My advice, based on plenty of personal experience, is to never buy the
first version of anything from Microsoft.  This includes major version
number upgrades from previous releases, such as Microsoft C 6.00.
Always wait at least for the "a" upgrade or slipstream upgrade if
you're going to buy it.

If you think that windows is useable, you must not use it much.  Windows 
version of "crash protection" is wearing a helmet while computing.  The arir

As an alternative, try posting them at comp.binaries.ms-windows, and
just letting us know.  A good idea is to post the article number here.

There was a post about something similar a while back.  It seems windows
does *not* take it upon itself to free up any sys. resources an
applllication is using when that application is done.  That job is left
entirely to the application.  that is, the application has to clean up
after itself when it quits.

Anyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which  will
clean up sys. resources when an application quits (mother.zip???).

There has been a long running discussion over changing the Startup
logo for Windows for a few weeks here. While all the COPY methods are
great & haven't seen any mention of a program that will do it for
you..... 

Well... I found one on CICA called winlogo (Can't remember where
unfortuantely), and it seems to work real well... even comes with a
couple example .RLE files. 

What I'd really like though is a way to create .RLE files myself,
specifically the RLE4 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file. Can
anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a REAL directory
path ?? All the ones I've seen mentioned didn't pan out.....

Here's the situation:

At home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, I
have windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, I
configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use
the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,
which I then bring to work.

My question:  how do I print this postscript file through the print
manager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file
manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me
several pages of postscript gibberish.

I know that I can open a DOS window and do:

	 copy file.ps com1:

which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications
run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.

There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print
Manager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in the
documentation.

Anyone know how to do this?

EMM386 is NOT reqired to load the DOS kernal high (or else you couldn't
do it on a 286).  In a mail message I recommended that he remove it
since he only runs ProcomPlus frequently in DOS, and I suspect
EMM386 will slow down windows.

Here's an interesting table showing how much resources an application
uses and how much it gives back on shut down.  This is take from
Windows User May 1993 issue:


Application		Min. Resource Use	Resource Not Returned
			GDI	USER		GDI	USER

WinSleuth Gold v3.03	10	6		2	14
Word For Windows v2.0b	10	0		5	0
Lotus 123 v1.1		13	3		3	2
Arts and Leters v3.12	7	7		3	1
PowerPoint v3.0		9	1		3	0
Corel Draw v3.0		10	6		3	0
Micro. Designer v3.1	10	2		2	0
CrossTalk v2.0		0	0		0	0
Excel v4.0a		11	8		0	0
HiJacck v1.0		2	2		0	0
Image-In Color Pro	3	2		0	0
PIcture Publisher v3.1	21	8		0	0	
PowerLeads!-
  Executive Ed. v1.03	0	5		0	0
Adobe Type Manager v2.5	1	0		NA	NA
Skylight v2.0		1	0		0	0

*The numbers are in percentage and are in a decreasing order.

What does this table tells you, if you frequently start and exit a
program that doesn't give back all of it's resources, then you
continually lose these resouces.  Therefore, only open these programs
up once and leave them open.


BTW:  Maybe people can add to this list so we know what application to
watch out for.
 
later,
Doug

		TComboBox(AParent, ResourceId, ATextLen) {};
	virtual void WMLButtonDblClk(RTMessage Msg) = [WM_FIRST + WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK];

Anything wrong with my program? Any help would be appreciated.

It depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that
comes standard with windows, or with an icon from some other icon manager.

Well, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the 
item by clicking once on it, click on 'File' and then on 'Properties'.
You should see a box which says 'Change icon'. Click on it. You are going
to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). If you don't like
any of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file
'moricons.dll' Select it. Browse through the icons presented, and just
double click on your desired icon.

If you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager,
say iconPower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your
screen, where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace.
When you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding
the mouse button down, pull this icon over the one you wish to change.
And thats it!

regards

Danny...

While working on my shareware toolbar, I found myself 'eating' resources,
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK, and specifically the debug
kernel. Once you have all the SDK stuff installed, (this also comes with
VC++), you run 'n2d' which does a 'normal-to-debug' swap. The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower, but you then execute the command
DBWIN, and let it report to you what is going on. You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to, and possibly about other
peoples Apps (is that OPA?..I'm sorry). 

If this doesn't make sense, repost, or e-mail me

It could also be that your shell is hogging the resources.  For example,
open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources
with ndw 2.x as shell,
 
then do the same with program manager, and see if it's the shell or the
apps.

Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you
done to cure it?

One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from
other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. From then on other
workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf 
again. 

The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machine
is a 486DX/33, 8MB RAM, with Diamond Stealth video.  It behaves this
way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters, including a SMC Elite.
It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver, rather
than the Diamond drivers.

I have just upgraded from a Trident TVGA9000 to an ATI Graphics Ultra (the
old mach8 chip).  I am quite pleased with the performance so far, but have
one problem.  When using windows in 800x600, I have noticed that the 
tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when I
was using the Trident card.  Is there a setting in my .ini files that I can
change to make these smaller ?  I could not find the FAQ for this list...

Please don't post uuencoded bitmaps here.  If you want to do so, put them
in the alt.binaries.* areas.  These files are very large and may crash
some users newsfeeds.  It's also a waste of band width.  Also, we all
know how to convert .gif to .bmp with many programs so it'd really not
worth posting all of these .bmp files.

Since loading Windows, two of my DOS applications have been
acting strangely.  It appears that font changes and page
orientation changes (so far) are not being recognized in
WordPerfect/DOS and QuattroPro/DOS.  Another DOS application
does accept font and page orientation changes, so I don't
think the problem is with the printer.

I reloaded QuattroPro, and these changes are still not
accepted whether launching from Windows or the DOS prompt.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how to
correct this problem?  I've ordered QuattroPro for Windows,
but need a landscape application printed immediately.  Please e-mail.

Thanks in advance!

You must of read too many OS/2 advertisements.  "Crash Protection" is such
a marketing gimick, it isn't funny..  Out of 4 months of using Windows on my 
new machine I've only had it crash ONCE, and I don't have a "run of the mill"
configuration.

Microsoft is not a leader in innovation, but they certainly know how to 
build a better mousetrap.  Now, what's wrong with that??

Hello Cliff 

Many people on the internet (like us) have to pay for
every byte of data passed through subscribed news groups.

Bitmaps are large. Bitmaps cost us a lot of money. There are
special news-groups for bitmaps because of this. We don't
subscribe to them. Put you bitmaps in the right place.
Read one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it
will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of
establishments like mine that you have just cost money.

Some of them have very limited budgets.

Go away.

P.S. This is a flame ;-)
P.P.S You distribution of "usa" didn't work.

	I'm trying to install WordPerfect 5.2 for windows on my computer.  I'm
running a 386sx25 w/ 2meg ram and a 4meg virtual mem setting for windows.  I
keep getting errors when I try to run WP52.  It tells me that I don't have
enough memory or disk space (since I have 47megs free on the HD, I'm assuming
that I don't have enough memory).  Can anyone tell me what it takes to run
this beast?  Thanks.

Actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops
mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows.  PC
Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group
does its development under OS/2.  Another trade rag did an article
recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations
with SoftPC to test out their work.  SCO Unix is and has been a
reasonably popular development platform for DOS, Windows, and even OS/2
apps.  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for
development work, IMHO, and apparently others agree.

It does sound funny, I will admit.  But for me it is true.  Windows crashed on
all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception)
.  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  If windows works for you,
then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of 
choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each
task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the
key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it
would be more of an even fight.

Wow, what did you use it for?  Single-tasked word processing?
I have 8 files loaded right now and a 29-MB virtual machine (12MB of
RAM). My friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a
floppy in the background.  Many unix people love OS/2 because they are
used to multi-tasking systems.

Too bad they hold a gun to the mouse piper while they
throw mice at their "new" trap, trying to get it to work. :)

    OVERVIEW

    The DIB image file format is intended to be a "Device Independent  Bitmap"
    file  format.  (What Microsoft means by "Device Independent" is unclear to
    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit
    pixels.

    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.
    If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-
    swap all short and long integer values.

    By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP".   This  is  because

    they  are  a  super-set of earlier "bitmap image files".  Consequently you
    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files.

    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors"  of  DIB
    images:
	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the
	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for
	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.
	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor
	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.
	 o   Old-style Bitmap images.

    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS

    The DOS DIB images consist of:
	 1.  A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file	 as  a
	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image
	     file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A "BITMAPINFOHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,
	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows
	     RGBQUAD structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:
	 1.  The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file
	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the
	     image file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A "BITMAPCOREHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this
	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a
	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:
	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header
	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.
	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of
	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a
	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header
	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).
	 3.  The image data itself.


    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.

    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.
    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header
    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  "windows.h"	include	 file.
    Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit
    images.  The five general steps are:
	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER
	     structures the basic image information.
	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the
	     color palette of RGBQUADS.
	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in

	     the "bfSize" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the
	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  "bfOffBits"	field  of  the
	     BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER,
	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).

    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type-
    defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those
    not familiar with MicroSoft C.

    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER

    This structure is defined in "windows.h" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {
		 WORD	 bfType;
		 DWORD	 bfSize;
		 WORD	 bfReserved1;
		 WORD	 bfReserved2;
		 DWORD	 bfOffBits;
	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;

    The "bfType" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves
    to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered
    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the
    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.

    The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this
    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times
    the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the
    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be
    calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in
    later.

    Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2"  fields  are  always  set  to
    zero.

    The "bfOffBits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data
    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set
    to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times
    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written
    write after the color palette if one exists.


















			      March 15, 1991





				    - 6 -


    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER

    This structure is defined in "windows.h" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{
		 DWORD	 biSize;
		 DWORD	 biWidth;
		 DWORD	 biHeight;
		 WORD	 biPlanes;
		 WORD	 biBitCount;
		 DWORD	 biCompression;
		 DWORD	 biSizeImage;
		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biClrUsed;
		 DWORD	 biClrImportant;
	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;

    The "biSize" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure
    itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to
    determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a
    BITMAPCOREHEADER.

    The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels.

    The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines.

    The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out
    as if there was one color plane.

    The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either
    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.

    The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is
    compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.
    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how
    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the
    data is not compressed.

    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to
    zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to
    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.

    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed".
    For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the
    possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  "biClrUsed"
    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may
    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set
    this field to zero.



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 7 -


    COLOR PALETTES

    Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD
    structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as:
	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {
		 BYTE	 rgbBlue;
		 BYTE	 rgbGreen;
		 BYTE	 rgbRed;
		 BYTE	 rgbReserved;
	 } RGBQUAD;
    The "rgbReserved" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount
    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is
    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  "rgbBlue",  "rgbGreen",  or
    "rgbRed"   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not
    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these
    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color
    composition.



    IMAGE DATA

    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image
    file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and
    certainly was.

    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four
    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel
    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The
    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:

		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;

	---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---

		 bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;


    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.
    The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the
    first line of image data in the file.

    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would
    expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit
    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one
    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.
    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the
    order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in

    an "RGB" ordering, a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 "BGR"

I have a very funny yet confusing problem.  I am using Telemate within
Win 3.1.  Everytime I close dos box, my Telemate operation get affected
(Normally I am doing file transfer).  However, if I open + close windows
program everything seems running smoothly.  My file transfer operation
get affected only if I close dos box.

Can somebody please gimme some pointers on what is going on and how to
fix it??

A friend of mine uses Windows 3.1 to do most of her work.
Unfortunately, she has very bad eyesight, and we haven't
been able to figure out how to change the default font
used by the system and application menus, or the font used
by the Help program (what use is hypertext if you can't
read it?) to make it legible to her.

If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts,
of any software package that makes Windows more accessible
to visually handicapped people, please let me know.

Thanks,

	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.
	Windows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by
	an errant application (My personal favorite?  Any one of the Corel
	3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly
	a number of times, mostly just running it's own applications.

	For instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading
	with Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard
	VGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that
	I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my 
	.finger.  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless, 
	I fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download
	finished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten
	the pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop
	(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).
	
	Blam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta
	see the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session 
	and got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were
	off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).
	So I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).

	PP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer 
	"connected" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way--
	it told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it
	was _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. 
	Shutdown and reboot.

	Ok, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...

	Hm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let's see.. Ah, the 
	windows list still comes up.  OK, let's try shutdown again.

	No go.  Huh.

	Alright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow.

	Hmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again.
	Nothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.
  
	In this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but
	OS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s
	been compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_)
	use.


> OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or

	That's the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on 
	OS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that
	would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs
	that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt,
	task protection or no.  

	For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
	WP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in
	a dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run
	WP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).

>then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of

	Please explain.  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is
	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even
	then, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per 
	minute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing 
	this--I've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing).



> and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS,


	Not sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six
	of these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2). 
	Windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the
	disk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency 
	were a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the 
	Intel desktop.  


> some of the

	On the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence
	that both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to
	them.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine, 
	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows. 
	(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash 
	install).  On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive
	than Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows
	just doesn't like.

PhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group, will be holding a public  
sneak preview of NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors.

Where: David Rittenhouse Labs Room A1
       33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PA
When:  Wednesday, May 5th
       7 pm to 9 pm
			 
			 
NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,
only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue
of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a "Hot Prospect". Now, NeXT is nearing release
of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to
the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and
Motorola hardware.

NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression
486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo
in San Francisco.

The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are  
interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by!

For a brief summary of what NEXTSTEP offers, see the May 11th issue of 
PC Magazine, page 66.

The format for Word for Windows doc files is available from Microsoft.
Call their Developer Support Services number (sorry, don't have it handy)
and ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec.

Warning:  It is not terribly useful, and you will need to do a *lot* of
looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored.

General primer:

Word for Windows stores its data in two chunks.  The first chunk is the
actual text in the file.  This is all stored together and has nothing
but text and graphics.  The second chunk is the formatting information.

For general use, to read a Word for Windows file, skip the first 384 bytes
of the file (its a general header).  Then read the remaining text until you
hit binary data.

I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS
(and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.  As a programmer, I
agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things.  It's annoying, too.
But when just a Windows user, I don't think about it much.  And, I doubt many
other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document,
calcing a spreadsheet, etc...It works and they get their work done.

Just a neutral comment:
It's funny, I think, how arguments about Windows vs OS/2 sound so very
similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that.
It's somehow very personal to people.  Convictions are irrational and
there's nothing wrong with that--it's just...interesting.

I  _do_ know  that  IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in  particular, have
absolutely no  problem  with  OS/2--never had  a "random" crash  while
running any of  my programs under  OS/2.   In fact, I  don't  remember
_ever_ crashing.

Of course, I really don't run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch
of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running.

And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running
Dos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a
tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from
particularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the
problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write
buffer, everything would work fine.

FTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies
(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)

>	For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed

Yeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware.  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2...

Well,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that
under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.

I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background.

>> and not being able to address your memory better than DOS,

>	Not sure what you mean here.

The idea is  that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows
DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around
720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see
around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for
my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now
handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course,
the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply
_never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows,
so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....

If you believe that, I have a nice piece for swamp for you for RE

Nonsense.  Sorry, I make fun of Windows all the time, but the above is
simply a myth.  Tell that to Microsoft, Novell and others who dominate
the market.

I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript 
laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been 
fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do 
some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might 
not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 
2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. 

The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a 
rather important font :-) 

I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the 
[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't 
work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files 
generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I 
manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file 
everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs 
to work with. 

And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are 
listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. 
Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows 
applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. 

Has anyone encountered problems like this? 

What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1

Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?

I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats

 MIRROR is one of those DOS commands that didn't survive the change 
 from DOS 5.0.  It's been dropped, along with BACKUP, JOIN, EDLIN  
 and a couple other crummy old DOS commands.  You can still use the
 5.0 commands if you absolutely have to, but they are not included
 on the 6.0 distribution disks.

 However, in MIRROR's case, I'm 99.9% certain that it does not know
 anything about DoubleSpaced drives...

	I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell
network (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set
up to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say,
I'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network.

	Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but
several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd
mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and
perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS
apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live
without it.

	Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working
with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals
are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that
leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be
Norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself.

	As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've
read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd
like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.

	Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often.

	Thanks for any replies.

The number you gave is the Borland BBS, and darned if I can find any
stealth drivers there!

Diamond's BBS is 1-408-730-1100 - according to the manual I got with
my Stealth-24.  I have had a bunch of trouble using the RIGHT drivers
that came with the card (locking up, de-syncing, etc.) so I hope you 
do better than I do!

Sorry about confusing subject/summary/keywords!!!

I am a postgrad researcher in ESL/applied linguistics at Edith Cowan
University in Perth Western Australia...

I DESPERATELY need help!!! I need to record the results of word
processing sessions in windows - so that I can sit down and replay the
results of my research subjects' wordprocessing behaviours -
naturally, I can do this with the Windows macrorecorder - and 2 or 3
other apps in windows - BUT I CANNOT PAUSE/RESUME!!!! - i.e. all I can
do is to ctrl/break to get out - this is useless for a researcher who
needs to be able to pause the wordprocessing session he is replaying
to make notes/annotations - and then RESUME from where he left off...

I am just about to commence my research for my Masters thesis and
would be EXTREMELY grateful for any assistance - if anyone can help
could they mail me at:

You have one. Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will
print it. You need to associate file extensions with such things as the
notepad for it to do this though.

This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you
drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file
(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.

Yes it invokes the associated application. That takes but 10 seconds?

I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute
a DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the File
Manager. A message box comes up and says "This program or one of its
components is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the
file."

Now, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the program
from DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM
(yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tells
me that the file is already expanded.

All my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when trying
to execute a DOS program from Windows.

Clues anyone?  Thanks!!   Christopher Wroten, cfw@world.std.com

I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as
a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as "foo.txt ." I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
"foo.txt" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems.

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it using
the current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ."

In other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on May 1
at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and
"foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec
macro points to it.

My main question is this: 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
time/date variable in the new filename?

The May issue of PC/Computing page 246 has a Windows hint and tips for
just this thing.  You have to edit the WIN.INI file and add a couple
of lines.  I tried it and it works.  I actually made my Title bar
and iconized text, and icon text smaller.  On my monitor it works well.
You can select a larger font also.  You edit the WIN.INI file with
a font name in your system directory.  Read the article because I would
not want to retype it here in case I type errored and caused your
system problems.

  Well, I've come into some money and want to buy CD-ROM, sound board
and speakers.  I have not kept up on any material relating to sound
boards and CD-ROM's because until now I never thought I'd have enough
money.  

  So can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good
package including CD-ROM, sound, and speakers (and software I
suppose)... OR since I don't REALLY need the CD-ROM right now give me
some good ideas for sound boards and speakers.  Those I could REALLY
use now.  I have looked at SoundBlaster Pro, which costs about as much
as I think I want to spend on a board (~$120), and I've looked at the
Gravis Sound board, which is about $140 and I don't know the
adv/disadv of either of these boards.  

  Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound, and to
use in Windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  So any
concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would
be greatly appreciated.  If anyone else is interested in this info I
would be glad to summarize responses and post.  

  And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right
direction and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth.  Thanks!

Make sure you use the small fonts driver & not the large fonts driver. Check
that in your setup. That's the only explanation I would find.

Its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and "stable" in
general than serial mice.  If I remember correctly, its because
of the differences in how the interrupts are handled, as well as
the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus
as opposed to a (9600 bps?) serial connection.

Is this just a general problem, or is it associated with a specific

Basically:
Windows prefers extendend memory instead of expanded (more work to do for Win)
and if no application desperatly needs EMS, you should leave emm386
with a "REM" in your config.sys.

I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows.
Specifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports.
Since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is:

1.  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit?

As I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get
around the above problem, I am working on the following approach:

I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the
WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load
this template of mine, which will work in the following way:

It will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the
.INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file.

1.  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way
to specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file?

2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to
read more than the 32k at one time?

---
Any help will be appreciated.

I'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs.  A
couple of issues ago, PC Mag listed as Editor's Choices both Conversion
Artist and Hijaak for Windows.  Anyone have any experience with those or
some others?  I'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and
I'm not making much progress with the screen shots.  :^(
 
I'm currently using DoDot and I'm about to burn it and the disks it rode
it on.  It's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving
me crazy.  Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a
TIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left
and right sides of the picture [!].  Usually it confines itself to not
copying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for
editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.
 
The one nice thing it has, though, is it's "dither" option.  You'd think
that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,
256 colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W,
you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which
turn to white.  For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays on
buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the
3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.
 
If you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less
buggy!) program can do this as well?
 
Much thanks for any help.

I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and I've had a little bit of 
experience with it now.  In general, it feels *FAST*, although this
is the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are 
impressive.

With my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following
WinTach 1.0 results:


Card				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATI Graphics Ultra		13.5	14.5	19.1	25.0	18.0
ATI Ultra+ (no aperture)	11.2	13.8	10.7	20.9	14.1
Hercules Graphite VL		16.1	67.8	41.4	52.8	44.5

Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB
had an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as
fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.

As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-
redraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly
heavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2
seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson's
contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex
Micrografx Draw document.

So far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.
The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  And
I didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules'
software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for
just $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).  Call 800-532-0600 if you want to
give it a try -- I'm a happy customer now!

driver? Wouldn't that be _horrible_ ? :) So netlanders, I need samples of
your collective experience (sic) -- Do you proud owners of a Trident 8900C
video card w/ 1MB VRAM have tried out more than one driver fro MS Win 3.1
which? which is the fastest? Not to be selfish, and to give you a motive
for responding, I promise I am going to collect all the answers, and the
actual drivers (provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencode&mail)
get the WinMarks using PC Magazine`s WinBENCH and... post the results here...
I am interested in SVGA drivers only (plain VGA users should run the Win
driver, or this is what I 've heard -- dont flame me!) Particularly
800x600x16 and/or 800x600x256 (that should cover the majority of SVGA users)
Well, what are you waiting for? hit that r or f or whatever...
All input welcome -- so are money and Sun SPARCstations...
Thanx in advance...

But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete
a tree - it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete
some files!  It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car.

Only because its crap, which is noones fault but their own.

By deliberately crippling the product?  Surely no...

Oh, hold on, I guess you're right.  That certainly stinks of MicroSoft
marketing techniques.

But the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new
technology, and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long
before Windows was even dreamt of.

Well Amen to that, but I wish it were a damn sight deader.  For a dead
product, its used an awful lot.  And I suspect its going to carry on
twitching for a long while yet, which isn't doing anyone any good.

(And MicroSoft don't appear to have given up marketing DOS, so it is a very
unusual form of death indeed).

We all had that problem, you need to expand the fonts manually, the program
"decomp" is on disk 1 & the equations fonts are on disk 3

Seen from a typographically point of view, ATM using PostScript fonts
is better than TrueType; the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is
gorgeous.
Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in
a PS font as problematically; they may have better use of the Unicode
features of TT fonts (in Windows NT).

I've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size PS fonts;
I haven't seen those as TT fonts. Most of them are rendering quite
inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts).
Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font; the first
looks better.

I am hoping that there will be ATM/NT !

--> FTP

     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from

is given at the end of this file.

**********************************************************************

--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)

	In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  
Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working 
LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than 
Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK 
smaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported 
the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the 
COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For 
power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  
the  downside, the disadvantage of this update 
can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version. 


***********************************************************************	
--> For Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  
the directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  
the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 

**************************************************************************
	    
--> Introduction
   
    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems 
analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using 
Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. 
    
    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for 
undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems 
Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have 
also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, 
IBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.

    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  
Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks ("COSY_Notes") which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books 
listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file. The contents of the notebooks in the "COSY_Notes" directory are 
given below.

--> Compressed Files

        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9
packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:

 COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     		compressed tar file for Unix systems
	
 COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 
				format (requires the   shareware
				 Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 
	
 COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS
    
     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on 
Macintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.


--> Installation of COSY_PAK

 o In UNIX Command line type the following command:

      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -

 o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware
    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.
  
 o In IBM Command line type the following command:

      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip

NOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use 
pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC's may limit the 
directory name characters to eight. In that event type "pkunzip -o -d 
COSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any 
Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.


     Uncompressing and untarring "COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z" or unzipping 
"COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip" will create a directory called "COSY_PAK".
         	
Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
"COSY_PAK" containing the following three files, four 
sub-directories and their contents:

SUB-DIRECTORIES in "COSY_PAK":  
  COSYPAK    - contains control tool box packages 
  MANUAL     - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. 
  COSY_Notes - contains notebooks 
  For_2.0    - contains Laplace transform package from Mathematica 2.1
  		For Mathematica 2.0 users.	 
    		
FILES in directory "COSYPAK":
  chap1.m   chap2.m   chap3.m  chap4.m  chap5.m   chap6.m  chap7.m
	
FILES in directory "COSY_Notes":

	SUB-DIRECTORIES in "COSY_PAK":	Common
	FILES in directory "Common":  Support.m

********************* Important ********************	

	The notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the 
"COSY_Notes" directory.  To use the notebooks, move the directory `COSYPAK' to  
a 
directory that  Mathematica can recognize :
	
        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine,
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on an Apple Macintosh,
        c:\winmath\packages                  	on an IBM PC.

	At the beginning of the "Initialization" cell of each notebook 
in  "COSY_Notes" directory, we list the example about how to make 
Mathematica identify the directory:

--> Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in 
the directory For_2.0. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 
into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 


--> Getting started

       After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the "COSY_Notes" directory. All notebooks load their own packages. 
Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.

I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm
looking for a Windows 3.1 Driver for it.  It's based on the Cirrus Logic
CL-GD510A-32PC-B chip.  I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand
and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer.
So if there's a V3.1 driver out for this chip set I'd like to know - 
preferably by e-mail at rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz
                     
Thanks is advance

It's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was
developing it...)

I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,
but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice
before 2.0 was released).

Hmm. Are you sure?  I'm speaking from my own experience as an
OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,
research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).
Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).

Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to "sell" 
readers on our products (which would conflict with the "no-ads" 
philosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have.

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,
members of the BORG.

While the 64K limit may not be _necessary_ limitation, they probably fall
within the category of 'reasonable' limitations.  If you find yourself
trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text, it's probably
time take a good look at your program's design.

>Why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory

In what way is 8192 a 'small' number?  It seems to me that you'd hit the
wall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global
handles, unless, of course, you're abusing GlobalAlloc.


And _please_ don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the
resources available under other operating systems.  All systems have
limits.  The question is whether or not the limits are _reasonable_.  So
far, you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows'
limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems.

I would like to find a Windows 3.x driver for a video board that is
based on the Chips & Technologies chipset.  The actual board is a
Scorpion Framegrabber made by Univision.  It is based on the C&T
chipset, but only barely supports the graphics mode.  I am hoping that
any C&T driver could be used in the 640x480x256 mode.

Thanks.

You don't, and never had to.  That's what enhanced shells are for.  Remember 
4DOS and NDOS?  I mean, come on, you can't expect DOS to cover everything 
from R1.0.  Microsoft has other projects to work on.

I don't think they deliberately crippled the project.  On the other hand, it 
IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on
top of DOS.  I mean, you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC.  With 
XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna 
need a fast processor.

Except for the people who use DOS programs, which means about 75% or more of 
the business world.

It certainly smacks of that! Remember the "POLL" that you quoted saying that
you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0? Care to recall how
unbiased the sample set was? That post sure looked like FUD....and coming
from a microsoftie .... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.

Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very 
unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that
OS.

>I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,

That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more 
defensive people in my life. Moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage
this too, IMHO.

Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for
MS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing.
I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ... I have not doubts about their 
abilities, just about the ethics of their marketing practices.

If he says he knows for a fact, what more do you have to gain if he gives
his word?  Do you think he's lying right now?

Anyway, how about this: I give you my word, without naming sources, that IBM
paid companies to write applications for OS/2.  Satisfied?

I have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode.  
For bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending 
on the exact dimensions), the wallpaper display is badly corrupted.  The 
rest of the desktop is fine.  For wallpaper bitmaps smaller than this, I 
have no problem.  I have a friend who has an 800k bitmap which he has no 
problems with, so it is possible.  It is also possible to display these
bitmaps using CShow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video 
card is not at fault.

How can I remedy this?

My system:

     386DX40, 4Mb ram.
     DOS 6.0, Windows 3.1.
     Oak 1Mb 077 Video card, 1024x768x256 mode, using supplied drivers.
     Windows has a permanent 11,288kb swap file.

Please reply via e-mail, and _use the address in my .sig_, as our post 
software always seems to mangle the address in the header.

    Thanks,
          Mazz.

While I do not think he is lying, I also feel hesitant to take anybody "on their
word" unless they can attribute a source for thier claims. With all the FUD 
and misinformations and misconceptions and outright lies flying around the 
advocacy newsgroups, I do not trust any unsubstantiated rumor or claim 
- especially from any employees of IBM's OR MicroSoft, or anyone who seems to
have a vested interest.

Hello,

I want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows.
The most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing,
mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem
card on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk.

My idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All
three have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large
harddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to
the printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least:
Workgroups for Windows.

My questions:
- Is this possible?
- What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups
  for Windows?
- Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone
  is working.

Thanks,
Martijn

Last night I tried to reinstall the utilities from the Windows 3.1 Resource
Kit disk. The setup program appeared to run perfectly normally, but when it
had finished, there was no Program Group created. Now, I know I've done
this before successfully, and creating a group myself didn't exactly tax
me, but I'm curious as to what might be going on. I can only assume that
something left over from the last time I had it installed is getting in 
the way, but I can't figure out what. Any clues, anyone?

I'd like to get a system running OS/2 2.0 GA talking to a network of PCs
running Windows for Workgroups.  Acting as a server would be wonderful,
but client access would be enough.

Can I run WFW 's NET utilities in a DOS box?  Or is there a way to actually
get OS/2 to talk to WFW?  Will OS/2 LanMan clients talk to WFW?

Dazed and confused,

Following up to my own article...  I found that several people say that 
LAN Server clients can talk to WFW.  Is this, then, also true for LAN
Manager?  (Don't LAN Server and LAN Manager share common roots?)

You are pervert.. Ok vi is not CUA but it has a powerful set of commands.
One for all it has 26 separate clipboard (and not only one ofor all kind of
data like Windows does).
The only problem is to Know the commands (the keyboard shortcut).
I am quite fast with the pc keyboard... and I usually use all fingers to digit
so when I use a editor I do not want to leave the keyboard and use the mouse
every time I need a special Function on the menu or to use the arrow keys
that are away from the usual position of my hands on the keyboard......
In my situation vi is very powerful and I'm searching to a vi editor 
for Windows....

As a followup to my post let me add that:

I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance.
However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the
application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from
within an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their
site-specific "batch profile" into a dataset within our product, specifying
the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,
etc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is
written to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and
run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as
the job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the
interactive session.

As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80
characters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in
batch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a
problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.
MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single
command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is
*STANDARD* with OS/2).

The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not
within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.
Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party
companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.
And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative
script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption
that they have anything other than what comes with NT.

I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like "Is vi
available for Windows?") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and
***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is
it a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites.

One last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,
i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run
there.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific
commands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment
on these commands, I would appreciate it.

Thanks again for the help,

I am trying to define my own class derived from the Object class so
that I may insert them into a HashTable (a class provided by the
Container class library).

I have defined all of the pure virtual functions of Object, but I
still get an error when I attempt to allocate a HashEntry object:

  Cannot create instance of abstract class HashEntry

Has anyone derived from class Object before?  What have I left out?
Here are the virtual functions that I defined from Object:

virtual classType      isA()   const { return hashEntryClass; }
virtual Pchar          nameOf()const { return "HashEntry"; }

virtual hashValueType hashValue() const { return hashValue(hWindow); }
// Note: hWindow is defined in HashEntry

virtual int            isEqual (const Object _FAR &obj) const
{ return this == &(HashEntry&) obj; }

virtual void           printOn( Rostream os) const
{
 os << "[ HWindow is " << (void _FAR *) hWindow << " ]\n"; 
}

   I am setting up my DOS/UNIX box on a 116M IDE and a 412M SCSI drive
and was wondering about the use of the (MS-DOS 5.0) JOIN command.  I
like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C:

points of UNIX filesystems.  I have heard that there were problems
with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS.  Please tell!

I solved my problem.  I still do not understand why it happens ths
way; perhaps some of you C++ gurus can explain this to all of us!

For some reason when I define the following functins in the class
definition (in the .h file) the compiler thinks some pure virtual
functions are not defined.  When I placed these two in a separate
source file and compiled them, the problem went away.  Any ideas what
happen?  Are the functions that are defined in the class construct all
inline ?  Is this the problem?

virtual int            isEqual (const Object _FAR &obj) const
{ return this == &(HashEntry&) obj; }

virtual void           printOn( Rostream os) const
{
 os << "[ HWindow is " << (void _FAR *) hWindow << " ]\n"; 
}

Hiyas ALL,

Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I 
couldn't wait to install it. I had gotten an advertisement for it and put 
it aside 
with my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. 
No part of 
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.

	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty 
million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of 
the 
systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're 
willing to 
give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their 
support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings 
of 
Windows 3.1. 
	After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned 
some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop 
Animator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of 

.dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 
100K the 
other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied 

with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll  
to a 
directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll 
in my 
Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) 
When I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the 
applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. Does 
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions 

for trouble-shooting?

On a recently acquired Gateway 2000 machine, when starting Windows,
three copyright statements flash on the screen right after the MS logo

with the machine.

The system is a Gateway 2000, 4DX-33 machine.

Doesn't MS do the same? (I.e., subsidize app development)

I seem to remember someone at RPI who received an entire (expensive, to run
NT) machine to develop for NT.  Free.  And that's just the small fry...

For the most part, this newsgroup is "attack" oriented.  Microsoft has been
attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the
intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc.  ANYONE
would get defensive when being baselessly attacked.  We are human beings as
well.  You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might
feel is unwarranted is leveled.

I am using OWL and want to display the output from a stream in a popup

alternatively set up a separate stream that supports output and be
able to display the stream output in an TEdit control?

Anyone ever done something like this?

No, I'd rather not.  First of all, I don't have exact figures, and I don't
want to disclose how I know this.  However, I will say that Jim Francis
from Microsoft just posted a figure of $26 million (payment from IBM to
Borland) and that's somewhere in the range that I've heard.

It was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it.
Note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
about that, or...

>Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was? 

When I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them (having
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
has very little positive to say about the product, I figured it wasn't
from there...) so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked.
And I was told it was from a survey of registered users.  And I 
posted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came 
from.

>That post sure looked like FUD....and coming from a microsoftie 
>.... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.

Hmm. I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where
they came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is 
"fear, uncertainty & doubt".)

>Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very 
>unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success 
>of that OS.

????  I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't 
pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other
OSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary
features.  I also don't push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in
comp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a 
new os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded 
during release, unless the sales are a total bomb).

I ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. Do you *really*
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?

I just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie
cutter. We don't all think alike.  Yeah, ChuckSt and I have some "inside"
info on MSDOS - doesn't mean that everyone else does :)

I had posted that it came from a survey of registered users, I 
double-checked with a friendly neighborhood marketing type and
found there were actually two surveys. One of randomly selected
resellers, one of randomly selected users from the 6 upgrade 
registered user database. Both surveys showed a 93% positive
rating.

Is there a hot-key for the Windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  If not, is
there an easy way to create one?  The reason that I need one is that my
dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly
secure).  Also, the system manager won't let any software be added so 
another program such as LOCK32.ZIP from cica or a different screen saver
is out.

Thanks for any and all help.

Which translates to 7% not satisfied.  I don't think it's the awkward 
recursive deletion that's bugging people, it certainly isn't the nice Windows 
interfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete).

	As far as I've noticed, it's DoubleSpace crashes.

Frankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises 
me!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is 
less likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible 
anyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace isn't it?

Anyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the 
doublespace!

Hello All!

    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -
secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?

	If JD Power and Associates did the survey, I would like an

	Well, these "statistics" are to shut people up and add some

	they tell us, "In a 'random' Chrysler-conducted survey..."

	because (as the WSJ says) he couldn't wait to use what he

Yes, where commodities are concerned. Imagining that capitalist

Hello,

recently I noticed there is a directory named "DiskImage" in my disk.  I didn't
notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files.
I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of
the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

Thanks,

Anibal

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice.

First a general description of the machine as follows:
 Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache
      (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it)
 Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256)
 ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board
 primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller
 secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller
 tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller
 planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port
 Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller
  future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface.
 Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board
 (ugly dos software drives the latter)

Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken
and Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio
work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo,
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files.  Also I use
Stacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she 
won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from 
Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files.  

I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the 
shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can
hope can't I, after all, I have work to do).

The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and 
hardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the 
upgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I
still need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) 
from some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm
allergic to command lines!  I plan to run a "pure" NT system.  Also, will 
NT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite 
Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the 
system (It's cramped now).

I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT 
version?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk
will be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)
a comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask 
Chili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd
rather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without
DOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?

Any feedback or advice (including "forget NT" with good reasons) is much
appreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better
multitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),
and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe
there are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing 
about them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)

Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.

Thanks,
Nathan Gregory

Are you sure you want to do that?  If a win app locks up for some reason, 
ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.  
Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion.
I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke.  Just a 
thought.

    Face it - the .advocacy groups are _for_ the kind of things that
you're preaching against.  This is why they were created in the first
place - to filter out all the crap from the newsgroups that might
contain real information.

Aha, I think I found the problem and it isn't dirt!  Another guy here was 
using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the 
default VGA for Windows).  He has an S3 LocalBus card like I do and when I 
loaded the S3 video driver in Windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.  
Seems like it is the S3 driver!  Is there any newer one than version 1.4 
that would solve this problem?  It is really bad.  I have to use the 
keyboard instead sometimes!  The s3-w31.zip on cica is version 1.4 (which is 
the same version that came with my card).

I think it is important to clear up your first reply.  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are
correct re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,
you can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the
uncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with
Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your A,B and D drives.

I'm told that I can replace the colorful windows logo that appears as
windows invokes with a graphic of my choosing.  The challange is that the
image must be in 'RLE' format.  I've got GIF's, PIC's, JPG's, TIF's, etc...
everything but RLE's!

What's the best route to converting these things?

I've recently uploaded to cica the current (v2.8) version of the working 
model of MicroCal Origin, a scientific and technical 2D/3D graphics and data 
analysis package for Windows 3.x. The working model is 2D only and puts a
promo message on hardcopies, but is largely identical to the full version.
Saving Origin files is disabled, but you can save ASCII data sets produced
with Origin. It also says it has an expiration date of Sept. 1, 1993.

Try it. You may like it, as I do!

It's currently in /pub/pc/win3/uploads as ORIGIN.ZIP.

This is the part that usually gets me. While I am set to make money, there usually
are OTHER things to be considered and debated. That is the purpose of life.
If you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification,
usually you'll end up with Japanese (or whoever that is competitive) owing your
business - i.e. short-sighted. IMO, this is very irresponsible, narrow minded and
selfish. Henceforth, ignoring the attack is not the right approach. As a matter of
fact, I just happen to believe the willingness to debate and readjust is the
greatest assets of this society. Sales number and stock price is the short-term
result, not the cause.

Less than 1/2 of mailorder price!

I have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars
mail order.  They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just
some scans with a silly EPS wrapper!)  They are:

1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images).
   This costs a thousand bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as
   high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art,
   etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R.
   library as higher.  Totem's art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other's
   are B&W.  It's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion.

2. C.A.R. Graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can
   purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size).
   This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as
   very high quality, but it's only B&W.

3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags).  This costs
   about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as very high quality
   (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which).  Some of
   the images are color, but most are B&W.

For what it's worth, all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats.
They are readable on Mac's and PC's.  Additionally, Totem's will mount native-
NeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC
filesystems.  I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines (I've owned
all three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago).

Also, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business
(and I've seen lots).  Also, Totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color
library around, although I like 3G's color art better.

I want $850 for everything.  Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as
VISA/MC charge.  If you pay by VISA/MC, I'll ship pre-paid in the continental U.S.
If I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee.

Reason for selling: No longer have DTP business.

Please respond via email or telephone, as I rarely check these news groups.

Please research carefully.  Just because a fax modem behaves like
a printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality 
when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely
installed" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the 
fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's
peculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware
interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager
program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to
it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To
software, it appears the job was "printed".  Print Manager 
plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.

Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were
up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be
required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.

Good luck.

I have had a lot of problems with it.  I belive I have the latest drivers for it.  There are some occasions when I fire up windows it works great.  If you ever find

One way is to use a program called Iconmaster. It's shareware and If you can't

If you happen to be running the new msdos 6, you could use multi-

the machine ... power up, select your name,  the menu will use your

Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures
of success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think
in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.
I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.

I also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call
them are highly technical. Look around in the real world people don't want
to GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their 
job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need 
a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and the
multitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does
this and does it WELL. We are running 150 pc's loaded with a complete
suite of mostly MS Windows applications in an administrative business
function on a Novell network running all software off the server.
It does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick
Windows again. 
Again I repeat to MS keep doing what you are doing. You are doing a great
job.

After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos
and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a
head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have, 
however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY
do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but
OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard
that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew
where to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like, 
once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

  Hi.  One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem.  His mouse
works fine in DOS applications, if you load them from the C: prompt.
Under Windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move.  Even
if you load a DOS app under Windows, the mouse doesn't work.

  The computer is a Zeos 386SX-20 w/Diamond Speedstar VGA running MS
DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1.  Mouse driver is Microsoft's 8.2.  I've tried
switching the mouse from COM1 to COM2, I've tried a different mouse,
I've reinstalled MOUSE.DRV, and I can't get the blamed thing to work.
The only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works
perfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional
parallel and serial port.  Could that cause the problem? 

  Thanks in advance for any help.

I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good
success in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of
people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command
(a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear
people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in
Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:

  "JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if
  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for
  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives
  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use
  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1."

Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I
have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems
that have been "mounted" using join.

In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It
wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then
delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.

Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic
place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the
joined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original
*.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you
search your disk systems, the document is gone.

I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box
when JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg
ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an "ls" on the c:\temp
dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to 
reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think
this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw
DOS.

So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not
be as robust you would like.

Wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main
file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,
JOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch
to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.

It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would
avoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was
meant for casual, even ignorant users, so "mounting" all the drives in
one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry
this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant 
users -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs
a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.

I am running windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode.  The sound card I have
is the ATI Stereo F/X-CD sound card which claims Adlib and Soundblaster
compatibility.

Using Windows MediaPlayer, I can play the midi files that came with
my sound card.  However, I can't play any of the midi files that belong
to the WinJammer midi editor that I ftp'd from cica.  I also can't
play any midi files I generate with muzika (also from cica).  When I
try to play the files, a dialog box pops up saying that the music
may not play right, and it has a checkbox asking me if i wish to disable
this message in the future.

Is this normal, or do I have something set wrong?  I would really like
to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it.

I also ftp'd the game dare2dream for windows (from cica) and its music
won't play either - I get the same dialog box.

The MIDI Mappers that I have are ATI Ext MIDI, ATI OPL3 MIDI, and Vanilla.
I have tried using all three.

Any help, suggestions, shoulders to cry on, etc. would be appreciated
very much.

Shareware is available from the net, magazines, distributors, clubs,
friends, and bulletin boards. I don't think people have any problems
getting hold of it.

Fill gaps in Dos? There's no need for many people - Dos 5 provides
more services than I need as it is. I just run Windows on top of it.

BTW, my Windows must be an operating system - it provides a Disk
Operating System that Dos can't access. (NFS...) :-)

[ Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it ]

This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.

I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to
customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their 
command line.

So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them
that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has
done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception.

Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to
all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

What version of WinFAX do you have?  The newest version (3.0) has an OCR
(Optical Character Recognition) built in... what this means is that it can
take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit
the document w/o re-typing it... However, I found that the OCR that comes
packaged with WINFAX does not work as well as OMNIpage Professional (also
by Delrina software)... So, once again, WinFAX ver. 3.0 has what you are
looking for... Good luck!

	This is one of the trickiest problems w/ Win 3.1 ... Personally I run
Telix 3.2 for DOS under Windows just fine (and 've been waiting for the Win
version froever... :) ), but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule:
I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of
them w/ big problems... Some of the stuff you have to lookout for: 
1) ALWAYS run the prog thru a .PIF, never by calling its .exe, 2) In the .PIF
_always_ toggle on _lock_application_memory_ --actually this is something
MS points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading
3) Go under Ctrl Panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your COM ports 'Alway Warn'
--it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4) Check where
are u running the mouse from - com port - 5) check the com port addresses from
your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel/Ports/(Setup?)/Advanced..
These might help u... If yu still have problems, get $100 and buy Procomm+Win..,
:) Hope it helps somehow...

	I don't think the question is:
		"will OS/2 X.X run Windows Y.Y apps now?"

	A more important question is:
		"will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps
		from subsequent Windows versions in the future?"

	Can it keep up?  Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps?
	OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.
	After this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to
	view Microsoft code.  After that, the only way to maintain
	some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  Would
	you want to reverse-engineer an OLE2 application?

Excellent suggestion, Ron.  And as a further comment on DOS 6, if
you decide to install Windows standalone configuration completely,
in more than 1 directory on your hard drive, and use DOS 6 to
jump to a specific copy for each user, you could be saving yourself
many megs of disk space if you use the SETUP /N and /A technique!!

Keywords: S3, Local Bus, Microsoft Mouse
Organization: Fine Arts and Communications -- Brigham Young University

I posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy.  
Well, I think I know why, and it doesn't have anything to do with the 
mouse.  It seems to be the video driver!  Here's why I think that:

A few weeks ago I helped a guy install the driver for his S3 video card for 
windows.  He had been using the normal Windows default VGA driver.  We don't 
have the same kind of mouse (mine is microsoft serial and his is an off-
brand serial mouse).  His mouse worked fine until I installed the S3 (v1.4) 
driver on his system, then his mouse became really jumpy too!

Is there anything I can do?  I need high resolution since I display LOTS of 
stuff on my screen (AMI Pro, Pegasus Mail for Windows, WP Office 4.0 -- 
sorry, nondisclosure!, and alot more).  I noticed there are S3 drivers on 
ftp.cica, but they are the same version that I already have and they are no 
help (I already tried!).

If you wait until May the 18th you will be able to buy the new OS/2
2.1 since it will be released at Comdex that day. It will run Windows
3.1 apps and Windows enh. mode. If you can't wait, then you can ftp a
6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product.

When you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task. The real power of OS2
lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch.

Happy benchmarking.

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputes
that OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an 
individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that
question. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2
and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse
set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
work. Go to your local computer store to answer this one.
I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This
is where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won
the single user PC war the next one will be the client server
war and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0.
Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be
attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'
of the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
is fun watching and arguing about it tho.

No, but...

You can allocate real static data within code segments!
When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap.

You can forget most of what was written about memory management. Under 3.1
you have paged virtual memory. You can lock every block without hampering
the memory manager. You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock/
Unlocking the memory block.

An besides: DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's, that happen to be called
by another task.

Autodesk Animator is a good tool. The one I like is Show Partner/FX. If
you want it, I could give a copy to you. I did a lot of advertising with it -
it lets you create both graphics (ANY resolution) and text frames, run it all
as a "film", you can make choices and include music - I guess that's just
what you need. If you're really interested, email me.

Macsee.zip on ftp.cica.indiana.edu is supposed to read and write Mac disks.

I just tried it, but I can't say that it works, 'cause it doesn't read 800K
disks, it only reads 1.44Mb. If there a program that does read 800K disks,
please let me know.

You can't customize a command line interface?  Where have you been?  I
can change the prompt, I can make aliases (so someone like me who is
used to say, ls, can type it on my dos machine and still get a
directory listing), and under Unix, if I don't like the command line
interface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh,
sh, etc...)

A decent GUI for all variations of Unix? Lessee... what about Motif?
Or the stuff from MIT? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty
standard. Heck, an xwindows program runs like it likes to -- all the
end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows
with the mouse, and since it is a GUI, it's *graphical* and a bit
easier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing
down our throats for some time now...)

The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users
running windows (all flavors) and the other "power" users running Unix
and other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty
much king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo
over to my friends house, and since we both run DOS, he can enjoy it
too.

Why should he have to?  This sort of thing should be included.  How about
the millions of people who don't have access to pd libraries over networks?

Just because people can work around it, doesn't mean that something shouldn't

I am running Windows 3.1 on a 386SX-16 MHZ with Five Megs of Memory.

The motherboard came with one meg, and I added the four megs this past
weekend.  They were 1X9 70 Simms.

I had installed in the application menu MS-DOS command PARK.  Up till
today, it parked the disk from the application menu without any problem.

When attempting to park the heads today, I received the following
message:


STOP        This application has violated system integrity due to
            an invalid general protection fault and will be
            terminated.

What does this message mean?

Thanks,

I'm not sure that this is possible due to the way the Mac writes the 800k
disk.  I think the way the sectors are set up are different enough that a
PC 3.5" can't read it.  This is a hardware problem which software cannot
correct.  Hope this helps and correct me if I'm wrong.

These are perfectly valid points and I agree. I'm glad we (MS) are starting
to remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future 
releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the 
mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over
the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS
(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.
The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people
until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the 
wayside.

Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to
be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either
stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that
point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the
short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS
3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.
Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will
offer even more in terms of "real" OS features (I work on NT and have no
real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
few years ago).

	...Dave

Of course these are my opinions. If you want MS's opinions, as a PR person.

containing the table.  Other documents without tables print correctly.

Where should I look and what should I change to get the document with
the long table to use the paper drawer rather than kick into manual
feed mode? [I believe I've tried all the obvious printer manager changes
as well as replacing the hppcl.[lp]00 files with archived versions.]

Thanks for any and all help.

Hello - I am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit TIFF images, to run under
        windows (3.1 if it matters); alternatively a package to run an
        X-server on top of windows would do very well. Unfortunately the
        budget for this is limited so whatever I end up using has to be
        public domain or very inexpensive. Thanks in advance for any help,

PaintShop Pro for Windows is a fantastic product.  It can handle TIFF, GIF,
BMP, PCX, and many other formats, displaying them and converting between
them.  There is a shareware version of the program; I assume it's available
in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations (I'd try
ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  Log in as ftp, use your username as a password,
and look for a program called PSP101.exe or something like that.  I have
the registered version, and the only major difference I can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it.

Once again, FANTASTIC software.  Up to 24 bits, huge images, everything.

You're right.

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 3.5" disk or Apple II
5.25" disk without extra hardware. However, Mac 1.44MB disks can be read
and written in a PC 3.5" HD drive with software only. 

This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file. It sure gets
asked enough.

Hi,

I got a NE2100 compatible ethernet card, and I just received my copy
of Chameleon NFS. Unfortunately, it is not compatible with the NE2100
(only NE2000 or NE1000). What is the latest version number for Chameleon
NFS ? Did soemone tackle this problem ?

Thanks for help,

I don't think MS has anything to brag about when it comes to following

Many thanks to those who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I have
had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested
in geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description.  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the 
early part of the century.  This may take me some time to do (in my
limited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested, 
when it is ready.

The responses I received are summerised below:

Kevin Donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that Michael Everson
(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts
for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me.  I contacted Michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and
that he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging 
IR 100 (about $160) for each one.

pbryant@ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'.  These are "Durrow" and "American 
Uncial-Normal".  I don't know where you can get these but I don't
think that they have the effects I am looking for.

Finally, rhiannon@netcom.com (Rhia) mentioned that the "Meath" font
included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package
is very much like what I was describing.  I faxed Casady & Greene for
info but got no reply.

So that's it.  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available.

Colum Twomey.

I know that there is a list of the best shareware and public domain
programs for Windows at the cica ftp site, but unfortunately it is a
year old.  The list author made it sound like the list was going to be
updated every month.  Is it still being updated?  Does anyone else
compile a similar list?
 
Also are there any individual suggestions as to what the best
shareware/public domain programs are?  I'm interested in good software
in just about every category (please try and include the ftp site and
exact file name, if possible, in your post).

Thanks, 
Sam

Well, you can't say that it don't work.  The inability to read 800k mac
disks is not a SW problem.  Rather, it's a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs. 

I have seen a post about a program able to read non-1.44Mb Mac disks,
which comes with a watchamacalit <ma memory's faling> card, which you
just drop into a com port or something.  Don't remember specifics, tho.

In trying to use the Equation editor in Word for Windows 2.0 I get
a couple of error messages along the lines of:

>Can't find font MT Extra for default printer. Some characters my not be

Similar for the font Fences.

I know I have these fonts on my system but are unable to use them.
I have tried both of these solutions to no avail.

If anyone has had similar problems and has found a way to fix this, could 
they let me know. It is urgently required !!

A program called Mac-ette allows you to read Mac 3.5"
high-density disks on a DOS machine. You can get the program from
simtel-20. I'm not sure of the directory location.

Do you mean that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior in _some_ respects (which
is trivially true), that it is objectively inferior in _all_ respecets
(which is trivially false) or do you mean something else? What criteria
have you chosen for your objective assesment? Are you sure that these
criteria are themselves objective?

IT'S BACK!!!!!!

Congratulations, you've just discovered a very nasty, and very frequently
ecountered, bug in the Word Setup program. Once you know what is wrong, it
is quite easy to fix. Go into the Fonts dialog under Control Panel, and select
the two fonts MT Extra and Fences. Delete them, but only delete the list
entries, not the disk files. Now select Add, and add the fonts MT Extra Plain
and Fences Plain. Close the Font box, close Control Panel, and restart Word.
Everything should be alright now.

Does anyone know if Microsoft has fixed this thing yet? They HAVE to know
about it by now, it's been so frequently reported.

I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to re-install
everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't I?!).
I am using a windows-based backup program (actually Norton), and I 
began wondering about the logic of this.  Sure, if I accidentally delete
a file, I can get it from the archive.  But what if my disk crashes again?
I would not be able to start windows to run the backup program!  (Note,
by crash, I mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine
from booting properly.  I think I gave up too early, but I didn't have
the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was.  My
hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. Yeah right...)  This whole scenario
is complicated by the fact that I am using Stacker.

So I think there are 2 possibilities:

   1) I'm right.  If my disk really crashes, I would at least have to
      re-install DOS and Windows to get the backup program working.
   2) I'm wrong.  There is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk
      that can easily restore it's state from scratch.

The polls are open...

This is indeed true. I prefer Windows NT. It is certainly much better
than Microsoft Windows 3.1/DOS.

Excuse me? Are you one of those people who *enjoy* working w/win? Come talk 
to a house-mate of mine and tell him how productive his life is when he 
encountered yet another sudden appearence of the DOS-prompt while cutting 
and pasting in win! Or an empty win screen without any tasks running (i.e.
^ESC brings up an empty list, progman has done it again.)

Don't they retain Windows NT OEM status? If so, that gives them NT

On all 1.44Mb drives (both Mac and PC), the disk spins at a constant
RPM.  On 800k Mac disk drives, the spin rate of the disk is varied so 
that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed; a slower rotation
for the outer tracks, and a faster rotation for the inner tracks.  A PC
needs special controller hardware to make this happen.

In the newer versions of Norton Backup for Windows (2.0 at least)
there is an "emergency" disk, which will allow you to restore
from tape without reinstalling DOS/Windows (I understand it's sort
of cumbersome to use, but not nearly as much as reinstalling
everything!)

I think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS/2.  
Considering that OS/2 is a multi-threaded true multitasking OS and
takes the place of DOS and Windows and more, I actually think the 
requirements for OS/2 are very reasoable.  I also think that anyone
using Windows 3.1 without 8 megs of RAM, a 386-40, and 200 megs of
hard drive space, is beating their head against a wall.  Those are
also legitimate requirements for OS/2.  In fact, the requirements 
for Windows 3.1 and OS/2 are about equal.

I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my 
hands on PC-Solaris...Unix for the Intel chip!  I know that there
are many of other unix possibilities out there, but this includes
the Wabi (Windows API Binary Interface...I think) technology that wil
run Windows apps straight outta da box.  If this flies in enhanced mode,
then here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education
market.

Too big and complex for the home front...Windows 4/Mac Sys7 will take those
while Win4Wkgrps - NT - OS/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses.

However, once the PowerPC becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form)
then these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix
machine at work and yet still run Windows/Mac apps at home is going to be real
attractive to alot of people!!!

Just my predictions.

Mike

I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list.  But we have
strayed from the original topic.  Our computer environment is pretty split
between Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But
there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users
here.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter
which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there
is no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been 
inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity
in a DOS program to selectively transport the files.

The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
windows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is 
in a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite
clear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.

My Windows 3.1 installation has somehow gone awry.  Whenever I try to run
Windows now, the logo comes up OK, but when it tries to enter Windows
itself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong
graphics mode or something.  It's completely illegible although functional
as I can still exit to DOS with an ALT-E RETURN combination.

I tried to reinstall Windows again, but if you recall, halfway through the
installation process, install takes you into Windows and there my graphics
problem surfaces again so I cannot complete the re-installation.

All this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my
config.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were before
this problem cropped up.

I'm running a 486-33DX with a Diamond Stealth VRAM (I've resinstalled the
Stealth video drivers again but with no luck).  I'm also using QEMM and
Stacker 3.0 but Windows is installed on an un-stacked partition.  And of
course, it worked perfectly before.

Any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Using the software you're using, I agree with you there.  What I did:
I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same
as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the 
DOS "backup" command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the 
"system" diskette, and use DOS "restore" to read in that much, then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your
case), overwriting what I've just restored.  That allows me to keep
this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization
on the "real" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.

Seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup
utility on a "system" floppy.  Then you could restore it all on one "go".

Please....Apples to Apples.  Nt is a beta, and as such cannot be accepted as a

It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but
the only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to 
challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris
or OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level.  Everybody
would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS/2 app on
an OS/2 system, they usually just can't afford a Unix system because
of the high prices for good Unix software.

It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing
budgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that
COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who
use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they
have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked
pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually
likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  That's okay, marketing
isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's
superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot
more to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they
could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even
use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with
compatability issues and absconding with the technology.

DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch
marketing and vendor agreements.  The "mediocre" was excusable in the
early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years
to play with it.

An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in
the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and
programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least
have the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0
and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?

The easiest way to do this is if you can send the files accross the network. 
This is much easier going from a Mac to a PC because you don't have to worry
about losing the resource fork of the file, often a problem when sending binary
files from a PC to a Mac.

Cliff, do you know the difference between "Windows" and "Win-OS/2"?  Here's
a helpful hint:

Running "Windows" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS
box. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1
no longer has a "real mode".

The ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows
clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added
by IBM to "Win-OS/2".

Now, everybody who is running "Windows" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2
2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running "Win-OS/2" under OS/2,
raise YOUR hand.

Get the picture, Cliff?

Here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server.  
The WinHelp() function, as I am told by MS, does search your path so 
relocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include
the path to where you move them to, however, if an application has 
hardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it
searches the given path (i.e. WinHelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for example) then
WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory
where you have installed your software.

I tested this out on a variety of software packages.  I moved all my 
helpfiles to the drive z:\ and included this in the path statement.
Here is the results for different software packages:


Norton Desktop			Found Helpfiles
Windows V3.1 for WorkGroups	Found Helpfiles
Windows V3.1			Found Helpfiles
MS Powerpoint V3.0		Found Helpfiles
MS Word				Found Helpfiles
MS Excel V4.0a			Did Not Find Helpfiles (strange)
MS Foxpro V2.5 for Windows	Found Helpfiles
Lotus Amipro V3.0		Did Not Find Helpfiles
Procomm Plus for Windows	Did Not Find Helpfiles


I guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to 
specify a global path for helpfiles.  

If anyone has any comments or If I can help anyone or if I left something
out please let me know.

Been messin roun progman.ini have ye?  I'm gessing you've been "tuning"
the system, that's the only way I can remember getting a blank screen
from CTRL-ESC.... when one of the PROGMAN.INI parameters was twinked to
0 or 3, can't remember.  I've never seen Win 3 do something like that on 
her own, Captain.

Microsoft has a division called Microsoft Consulting that does what
IBM FEs (field engineers) do.

However, neither company just up and sends consultants to client sites. 
Both companies charge very high hourly rates for on-site consulting unless
the client has already paid an annual service contract.

Hmmm.  I gave two examples which matched your objective criteria, and your
response was some subjective claptrap about them being 'lame'.  You never
did counter the fact that those examples fit your objective criteria.

One wonders who's playing semantic games, here.

I have just added a Panasonic KP-X1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. I installed
the appropriate Windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but I'm
unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly. 
 
What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. My
experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) print
ok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write will
print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts. 
 
When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change 
the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.
 
I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates,
namely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs.
 
If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most 
chuffed.

By night I'm an Amiga user. By day I work with windows. I'd be much more 
comfortable in windows if I had Two things.

1. A good Personal information manager. You know- a calendar, address book,
reminder list etc... rolled into one clean interface.

2. A good file manager. Microsofts is very poor by my standards. How
about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations 
between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface
would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing. Those
who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm
looking for.

If anyone can steer me towards an FTP sight with these programs it would
make my transition to windows a lot easier. Please reply via email
as I rarely get to read this group. thanks so much!

Casady & Greene seems to be notoriously slow about responding, as
I've heard from others who have contacted them.  They may not reply
via fax, but via snail mail.  Give them time, or contact them again.

Lotus Organizer!!!  Quick, cheap, pretty!  And has all of those features 
you want ...

You might look at one of the shell alternatives provided by third
parties.  Norton Desktop for Windows, for instance.

Personally, I *like* File Manager, which comes with Windows.  It's much
faster than NDW's, and the File Manager that's part of Windows for
Workgroups even has a decent button bar.

That first you can do with File Manager, but the others you'll need
to look at NDW or PC Tools for Windows, etc.

I haven't yet seen a decent freeware or even shareware shell.  But
it may be just me.

(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over
a week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)

Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the
pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story
but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the
potential pitfalls of "upgrading" to DOS 6 that I have been able to
notice after only about a week of playing around with it.

My envorinment
==============

TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk
System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments
CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel
Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments
Smart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-
Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs

After "updgrading" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things
became so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the
process of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.


Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive
==================================================

While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain
applications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is
that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to
consider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)
and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).

The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from
factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" to
DOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of
more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew
that DS compression must cost something.

Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually
*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than
I/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings
in I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large
random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.

While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or
sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on
WinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.

The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv
on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective
statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or
even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and
slow disk I/O'.

This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why
'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.


Double Space and Windows
========================

DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you
wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that
matter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos box
within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you
get.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.

Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to
file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed
floppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed
floppy if you dont know how to.)


DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM
==============================================

Defragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited
patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.
This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take
no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)
but it took 12 minutes.

I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran
faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this
had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)
module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,
and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After
disabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.


Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots
====================================================================

In the readme.txt file, you can find the the following

	Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup
	for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in
	your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you
	run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.

If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it
means "disable all power saving features of your notebook".  Why would
anyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only
does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the
readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what
else) are crippled by the TI's power saver.

It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If
there indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI
programmers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have
to guess as to who are the idiots.

By the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE
in DOS6, when you check the status, it says:

	Power Management Status
	-----------------------
	Setting =  ADV: MAX
	CPU: idle 60% of time.

This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook
when I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in
iconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all
for itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is
such an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating
system or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%
idle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type
of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'
example of our times!


Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming
===================================================

I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of
addpath statements like this:

	set PATH=C:\DOS
	...
	set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN
	...
	set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS
	...
	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN
	...
	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%

Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old
one (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every
path statement, and prepends C:\DOS to its value.  As a result, my
resultant path has so many DOS's.

If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add
the new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement
containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.
(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a
directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)

Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)
decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and
prepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it
would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.

I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft
representative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he
specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the
information to him as he did not have access to internet.

Now that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement
with %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement
should not be touched for any reason?

As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to
understand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:

	set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE
	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%
	loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM

Guess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with

	LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM

Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its
parameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.


DOS 6 Software Quality
======================

DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,
you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the
commands that come with it.

I am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to
use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont
within a week, I will post how you can create this "ghost" file.

Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a
particular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)
programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find
it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft "tests the quality" of
their products.

I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to "test quality"
when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but
can only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any
form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs
that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond
repair!

Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk
is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the
defragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated
when I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive
defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and
with no new file creation since.

Microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you
admit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we
should watch out for if we have already used DS.

Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better.

1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.
   That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You
   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left
   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your "left
   and right window" as you can have as many open as you wish instead 
   of just two.

2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking
   on the executable's icon.

3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double
   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have
   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The
   "browse" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you
   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.
   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your
   requirement for "text reading and graphics viewing".

I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up
all the associations you need is the way to do it.

If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be
pretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how
some things are done.

I think somebody posted some info about a biobliography program one or 
two months ago. I don't rember the detail. What I'd like to have is one 
software to organize the literature I'm refereing for scientific 
publications. The functions I'd like would be 
a. able to do data-base managment
b. able to print with special formats for different journals
Any info would be appreciated.

I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,
show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very
convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files
I use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does
also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.
This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university. 
The drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the
program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion
sched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19
(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this
windows program start.

Very well indeed.  At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch
an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  It drops
a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
one frame update every 30 seconds.  An ISA Graphics+ was able to do "Zoom by
2" without any perceptible performance penalty.  It is the best performance
I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which
uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA
bus at any point).

Hello Netters

	I recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer.
The other day, I bought the COMPUTER SHOPPER mag.  I was looking through
printer review section and noticed the WINPRINTER800.  The machine is 
incredibly low priced for all the features it has 

			800 dpi!
			8Meg RAM
			Postscript compatable
			envelope printing

My question is does anyone have one of these or know why the price is so
cheap?  I would appricaiate it if someone would pass on their knowledge
on this subject.  Thanks alot!

: In other words, it is your *opinion* that MSW3.1 is inferior to its
: competition.  That's not the same as MSW3.1 being objectively inferior.

No.  It is technically inferior to the OS/GUIs that I listed.  I have already
described why.  To say briefly:

System 7 --easier to learn and use.  There have been independent studies to 
           that effect.
OS/2     --Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking.
NeXTSTep --easier to learn, use, and program. More stable multitasking
UNIX/X   --As easy to learn and use.  More stable multitasking.

With the prpoer setup, all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as
well as MSW machines will amongst themselves, so interoperability is not
an issue.

By this criterion, it is inferior.  If you have another, then perhaps I am
incorrect.  Do you pick up the glove?

	WinFax Pro provides you with OCR. It is the OCR from OmniPage.
	Although it is not as customizable it does the job and is auto
	matic (if you want) and much cheaper than the same package
	(Omni Page Professional = $700) sold separatly.

	Last time I check WinFax Pro was only $100 ??

Does anyone have any information or better, first-hand experience,
of the new Epson bubblejet printer - Stylus 800??

I'm particularly interested in hearing how well it works under Windows;
I presume that a special printer driver is required - is it supplied
as standard? Is it able to print everything that a standard Postscript
laserprinter could??

Many thanks for any replies - George

	Nah .... if MS Windows 3.1 were an operating system, so would be
X-windows, motif, geoworks , desqview, the shareware Win-Boss C library
and that what's-it's-name text-based windowing system written in Applesoft

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not unreasonable, since the SMARTDRV packaged with DOS 6 is version 4.1.
Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being
executed from the DOS directory.

Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not,
I don't know what might cause the startup delay.  My testbed for DBLSPACE
(which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't
eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in 
about 20 seconds from the "Starting MS-DOS" herald to the end of the
AUTOEXEC.BAT execution.  I don't have handy a system with a more
realistic volume of data to time.

Actually you fell into the above because you said "I believe"

I do not think anyone would have agrued with you.

The following three are not the competition for Windows 3.0 (IMHO of course)
System 7  -- Does not currently run on Intel boxes
NeXTSTep  -- Rather expensive should be a competitor to Windows NT not 3.x
Unix/X    --   "        "        "    " "      "     "    "     "   "   "


With the exception of OS/2 all of the above will require most users
to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that
run under these OS's. And basically money speaks louder than anything
else. You keep saying "More stable multitasking" is what you mean
"Not Multi-finder / GEM / GeoWorks co-operative multi-tasking but
real honest to goodness prioritized pre-emptive multi-tasking"?

Basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for
quite a long time, but are still to blind to know it.

Why pick it up? You stated the reasons behind your opinions. Stated them in 
a very straight-forward, though over protective, manner. And aside from
my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor, I think we are in
agreement.

Does Tim Glauert agree? Let's wait and see.

The reason for the change from Smartdrv.exe 4.0 included with
Windows 3.1 to Smartdrv.exe 4.1 included with DOS 6.0 is
COMPATABILITY WITH DBLSPACE.  Be sure you are running smartdrv from
your DOS directory.

Hmm...has anyone of us computer geeks (me included) ever consider
that inovation is not limited to software/hardware.  True, MS
products do not boast features that MS invented, but how many products
out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in
their continuing development? 

I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing.
It is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature(s) in thier GUI
that are better than MS.  But people like me can't afford them.
It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..
but they are just that...low end.  System 7 is a better operating
system, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for
my tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the common
user to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things 
do) and they either puke or faint.  

If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  But
for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware
that it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..

Oh yea, I guess the fact that the support products and applications
they have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too..

Note that the filesize .dll is a part of the Windows Resource Kit. If
you install it (and you can download it from Cica), it will make the

Sorry, I don't have the demo, but I do have the program and have been
using it for the past few weeks.  Since I now have Dos 6 as well, I
don't use many of the features of PCT4Win.  But I do so use:
	- the PCT Desktop with drag and drop printing, folders in
          folders, and multiple desktops
	- the file manager which is far superior to win 3.1's fm.

 Many thanks for the replies I received to this. A couple of people
suggested how I could get the paint package to work properly, but in the
end I took the advice of someone else to try Paintshop Pro from

I have a 486/33 VLB machine, with a Wang 96/24 fax/modem.
When using the windows terminal application, the only way
I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2,
then go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine.
(I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't have
anything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual
for all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is 
jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't
use the second serial port and the modem at the same time,
but I'm not using the second serial port anyway.
Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem
and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end
answers.  Don't know if that helps any.

Thanks,

EISA:

When I start Windows, the first 5 times I try to run an application, it does
not start. Windows will show the following error message:

   Error Executing application. There is not enough memory to run the    
   application.

After the first 5 tries, the application I want to run will start, and 
afterwards there are no more problems. When I change the Video driver from 
Mach 32 to 8514/a, this problem does not occur, so I suspect the ATI 
drivers (I tried both the build 55 and build 59 driver).

Does anyone have a clue?

OK, now you are starting to define your criteria.

I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that.  You have shown that some
aspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems.  As I said
earlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true.
But some aspects of MSW3.1 are actually technically superior to each of the
other systems (resource requirements, performace, device support, printer
support, GUI etc.)

[ BTW, I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIX/X is as easy to
  learn as Windows! ]

But I might even agree that, on balance, MSW3.1 is technically inferior to
some of the competition. This still does not prove your point.

|>  If you have another, then perhaps I am incorrect.

Range of available applications? Base OS cost? Cost of applications? Cost
of hardware? Multi-platform support?  Quality of the after-sales service?
Availability of books/training materials? Support for visual and physical
handicaps?  Suitability for use in mobile computing? Quality of
Documentation?

If you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on
an OS, or indeed the primary factor, you need to think again.

I've recently re-uploaded to cica the current (v2.8) version of the working 
model of MicroCal Origin, a scientific and technical 2D/3D graphics and data 
analysis package for Windows 3.x. The working model is 2D only and puts a
promo message on hardcopies, but is largely identical to the full version.
Saving Origin files is disabled, but you can save ASCII data sets produced
with Origin. It also says it has an expiration date of Sept. 1, 1993.

Try it. You may like it, as I do!

It's currently at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.17) in the directory
/pub/pc/win3/uploads as ORIGIN2.ZIP. The file ORIGIN.ZIP is, unfortunately,
incomplete (SORRY 'BOUT THAT!).

 I just removed an IDE drive and reformated two SCSI disk to use as boot disk 
in a system that did run Windows fine in 386 Enhanced Mode. Its a DX50 with 8 
meg RAM, and an Adaptec 1542b with bios enabled. System runs fine and runs 
Windows in standard mode fine, but it returns to the DOS prompt when trying 
to run 386 mode. I've tried EMMExclude and SysROMBreakPoint. What gives??????

Thanks in advance, Hal

	I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk.
Is it just a strip-down version of the later?

	I have both Norton Speedisk and Backup, so I was wondering 
if I need to install MS Backup?

Are you using Windows 3.0 or 3.1? If you're still on 3.0, 3.1 devotes about
twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently. If 3.1,
you might use one of the resource monitors (such as the one that comes with
the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available)
to see which programs are hogging the resources (every icon, internal
graphics brush, etc. in every program running uses a certain amount of
this limited memory area. Also, some don't give it back when they're
finished).

On ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/misc/winadv.zip is a writeup by
Steve Gibson of InfoWorld with winbench 3.11 and a number of other 
benchmark results for nine isa and four VLB video cards.  This is a 
very current upload and is likely to have any card you're currently 
giving serious consideration.  Not in XLS format.  Latest version of
WinBench that I know of is ver 3.11.  I believe they try to maintain
the same rating scale between versions, and new versions are released
to defeat the lastest coding tricks put in by driver programmers to
beat the benchmarks.  Don't know on the last one.

I got the offer to upgrade this weekend. It's $19 + $8.50 shipping and
handling. The S+H seem way too steep for just a couple of disks. Sounds
like ripoff city. Can this purchased at vendors?

Note here: the MKS toolkit (for DOS/Windows & OS/2) gives you a good
suite of standard UNIX utilities.  There are other similar systems from
other vendors as well.  The EMX system for OS/2 gives you most of the
standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under
OS/2.  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs
directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of
all, EMX is free.  :-)

There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with
Windows, as far as I know.

Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows, neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point.  Neither OS/2 nor UNIX requires
DOS.

BTW, two of the best unices I've seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare ($300
for the personal edition) and LINUX (free).  So I don't agree that "a
good one costs $400-$700."  :-)

And, if you really want to check out the various options available to
you, you should also look into DESQview and DESQview/X.

   I am looking for comments on Xtree (Pro ??) for Windows.  I am 
thinking of buying the product but I have not even seen it yet.

Thank you...

Apparently not. Many people complain about the confusion that
results from the filemanager/progman split. It's just a basic
flaw.

Besides, what about the control panel icons? Where are all those
little files?

I Have a Sound Blaster ver 1.5

When I try to install driver ver 1.5 (driver that comes with window 3.1)
It tell me to upgrade my card first!!!????

Now, I have found new drivers from Creative labs.

But I have problems installing it:

After removing the vsbd.386 (old version that come in windows)
After installing Creative Sound Blaster - MIDI Synthesizer

I try to install Creative Sound Blaster 1.5 Wave...

But when I am in the menu: Add Unlisted or Updated Driver
and double click on this driver, I have this error:

--------------------------Driver Error---------------------------

Cannot load Creative Sound Blaster 1.5 Wave and MIDI driver. The driver file
may be missing. Try installing the driver again, or contact your system
administrator.

Yes, yes, yes, I have read the README.1st and try every thing!

can somebody help me??

Nathan,
  Win31 has a fixed limit of 64K GDI memory, regardless of physical RAM
installed, this is twice that of Win30, but not nearly robust enough for
many developers and power users.
 
Using Amish Launch as your shell, you can reduce GDI memory usage by as
much as 15% over Progman, NDW 2, DAshboard, and other graphical type icon
based and other shells.  Also, nesting, and full hot-key global support
is offered, something no other shells have at this time.

Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality
at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs
related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason
for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the
market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font
vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being
hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted
TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.

TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting
of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the
Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can
be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not
just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.

> You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like.
> ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality
> and be more complete in terms of foreign characters.

Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone
converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT
allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs
in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate
for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack
2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that
if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.

     Don't bother if you have CPBackup or Fastback.  They all offer options 
not available in the stripped-down MS version (FROM CPS!).  Examples - no 
proprietary format (to save space), probably no direct DMA access, and no 
tape drive!

     You NEED MS Defrag if you use doublespace to work on the compressed 
volume.

This list appears to imply, that MS-windows that has a cost listed
above at $70, comes with a C compiler, C++ and Fortran. It does not, of
course. These are expensive add-ons that drive the price WAY beyond $70.
( I don't know if the same applies to OS/2 )

As far as unix is concerned;
There is a free unix, linux, that has cc, ~c++, fortran ( f2c ),
Xwindows and many other features besides, with a large number of utilities
that can be optionally added. And there is also a free 386BSD I believe.
Both these unix's are quite robust. You can check out comp.os.linux

If you don't want to "throw our many down the tubes", you've got to break
that list down a little more.

I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the
SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup.  It's like
it's trying to it's bit in wearing the damn drive out.  I estimate it's only
reading a Mb of programs & data, but from the performance the drive gives, it
sounds like they are scattered all over the drive (my drive is however
regularily compressed).  What is it that takes so much fuss.  Perhaps if MS 
would take the trouble to optimize this startup process, less people would 
be wanting to find a solution themselves.

i dunno about linux, but for 386bsd, don't forget networking
(well tested, at that), NFS, a fast, incredibly stable filesystem,
and the list goes on...  8-)

for us 386bsd folk, look in comp.os.386bsd.*.

I believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on 
ftp.cica.indiana.edu
in pub/pc/win3/nt called something like nwnt.zip

There is an INDEX ascii file there, which lists the programs in that directory
and what they do.

unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcp/ip over your
primary nic, so if you really want to run it, get yourself an extra nic and
bind it to that.  

Otherwise wait for next release, like I am.

Has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging
after the installation of DOS 6?  I have narrowed the
problem down to EMM386.

If if remove (or disable) EMM386, windows is ok.  If EMM386
is active, with NOEMS, windows hangs.  If I use AUTO with
EMM386, the system hangs on bootup.

Dave.

Windows Shareware Monthly (WSM) is an on-line forum for information about the
newest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software. 

WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single
Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for
entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.

WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize
their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase
their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software
will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their
fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other
relevant information.

Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the
following manner:

1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all
   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart
   from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details
   such as: the current release version, where the software is available,
   how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any
   special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the
   author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the
   summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it
   short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480
   resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.
   All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will
   be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files
   into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting 
   conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,
   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows
   NotePad to create the .TXT file. 
 
2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which
   display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases
   (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may
   submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit
   and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which
   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's
   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or
   WinGIF. 

3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs
   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be
   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.

4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  

5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional
   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).

6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:
   
   DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU

   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America
   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP
   file, then e-mail to:

   DiegoAA

7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete
   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,
   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.

All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent
edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and
we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.

WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be
devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial
software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of
the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required
(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There
is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial
product entries.  

Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may
be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of
the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first
ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent
submissions will not be included due to size constraints.

WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author
columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and
two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will
be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column
on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or
DiegoAA on America Online.
 
The first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online,
Compuserve, and the Internet.  The deadline for submissions is April 28th.
The first edition filename will be WSM-1.ZIP, with each subsequent monthly
release continuing in the series naming convention (WSM-2.ZIP, etc.).  Each
edition will be released on the first of each month, and the deadline for
submission will be at least three days before release.

	Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the 
	maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the
	characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility
	in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font
	file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters
	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.

Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters.
And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI
in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac. 
No difference there between T1 and TT!   

And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters
is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there
is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')

	For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows
	char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font
	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac
	char set. 	

Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.

The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,
you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a
font may very well have them.

ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a
new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow
you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the
`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?

Please reply via EMail...

When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINAL.EXE or 
Crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  I mean, when the software's
window size is max, it still scrolls around the 2/3 of window.  It does not
use whole window.  I set "stty rows 30", but still the same. Scrolls at 2/3
from the top of the windows.  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software
to use whole window?

Thanks in advance.

I've heard about Ottomenu which should be a good desktop
on Windows 3.0/3.1 . 
Can anybody tell me where I can get it ?
It should be on CICA in /pub/pc/win3/util but it is not.

It is also not an WUSTL,SIMTEL and a great number of other
sites.

Just post it or mail me.

This is an official RFD for the creation of a new newsgroup for the
general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS.

NAME: COMP.DATABASES.ACCESS

MODERATION: UNMODERATED. At this time, no need for a moderator has been
assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed.

PURPOSE: 
Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG
design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a
database programming language called Access Basic.
THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's 
WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
Access Basic to create complex databases.

RATIONALE:
Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical
Development enviroment and its initial low price.
Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices.
For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss 
their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.

Yes, and the idea was ripped off from Adobe, which has had a program
called  TypeAlign for a few years now.  TypeAlign does the same thing
for Adobe Type 1 fonts; *and* Adobe has said that the next version
will work with both Adobe Type 1 and TrueType.

And TypeAlign does some things that TrueEffects does not - including
some things you apparently want ...

I am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and I
have a few question about Microsoft's Office Pack.  

1)  I was wondering, are the programs that are packaged with the Office
Pack--WinWord, Power Point, Excel, and ccMail--complete and the latest
addition?

2) Are the programs "hobbled" in any way? 

3) Can we update single programs at a latter date ( i.e. from Excel 4.0 to
Excel 5) ?

4) Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation?

5) Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package
less of deal that it seems?

Sorry if I seem skeptical put the price for the Office Package--$439.39 on the
street--sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first
computer and software.  But all four complete programs for less than $450
makes me just a little suspicious.  Maybe its just me.  

Thanks for your help in advance

Just as the title suggest, is it okay to do that?
I havne't got DOS6 yet, but I heart DoubleSpace is less tight than stacker 3.0.
What are disadvantage/advantages by doing that?

Any comments will be appreciated.

Yes - ignore the manual.  Just insert the evelope - don't use the keypad
to move it up.  The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that
tells it to load the envelope - if it is already loaded, it gets ejected
and the printer tries to load another.  The instructions in the manual
are for dumb DOS apps. that don't send the "load envelople" message.

Be very careful with these results!  As I recall, numbers from Winbench
2.5 are calculated differently from 3.1, and so these figures are not
comparable.

However, to answer Stephen's question, replacing the Ahead B card with
a Diamond 24x will yield a cost-effective, dramatic speed increase for
Windows.  That or the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus....

And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want
to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his
InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually
every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the
driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the
WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to
how cards stack up on real world tasks.

In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators,
and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly,
they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt
operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other
types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least
one card was eliminated from the "Editor's Choice" because of
cheating on the benchmark.

I have one thing to say-- why does everyone say that spliting them up is
such a bad thing?  I actually like my program launcher and file manager
do be seperate.. it make things easier to figure out.. I mean, take a look 
at OS/2's wps... (no flames!).. I personally hate it cause I just
have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy..

and don't say "just drag the icon!".. Cause I hate icons in the first place.
I have too much trouble telling what all those little push buttons mean.
I want "F"ile "C"opy etc.. 

although I know I'm in the minority.

Ok, so if everyone is cheating.. is there any tests that run some 
macro (to load a huge drawing, etc...) on the SAME machine that might 
then tell us what the REAL world results are?

I mean, run the tests on the same machine with different video cards
running word, excel, or something like that to see how fast the cards are?

There you go.  COM1 and COM3 use the same IRQ, therefore you can't use
a mouse on COM3 and a modem on COM1, or vice versa.  It's a limitation
of DOS.

And in fact Windows will not see a mouse on anything other than COM1
or COM2.  Accept this fact, and either get a bus mouse, or get a new
computer.

No.  The advice above applies....

I contacted Lotus about this problem today.  It has been reported previously
and there is a fix.  Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters
are used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around when
equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one
preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where
placed w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately, once the page run-on has
occured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters
to align equation frames.

Hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this 
problem.

Yes, both dblspaced and non-dblspaced drives can be defragmented. I believe

I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem. I tried a mouse on COM3, IRQ4 (the
usual place) and it still did not like it. Simply, Windows seems to only
support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that
Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse
sitting on COM3. Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least
support COM3? :-)

I've tried this too. Actually, I wanted to be able to use my second
modem (COM3/IRQ5) from Windows. It still will not talk to that modem. I
created two profiles, AMSTRAD (for my Amstrad modem on COM1/IRQ4) and
MAESTRO (for my Maestro on COM3/IRQ5). It will not talk to the Maestro
at all.

If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ10 as well.
Finally, a board that supports IRQs >9. The only one I have (except my
IDE controller).

We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. 
For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   
always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      
filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                        

Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   
a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   
at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  
to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  
allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            

I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC 
product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                       

I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume that
ours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?  What solutions have  
you come up with?

As a beginer, I just wonder how to transfer files from the Sun 
system (which is on the network) to my PC at home (not connected
to the network). I tried to use 'COMit' to do so, but it was very
slow and it seemed that getting multiple files at the same time
was impossible. Could anybody give me some hints & infomation?

Thank you in advance.

In comp.os.ms-windows.misc you write:

>While reading through the DOS 6.0 book, it states that the Windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive.  To make things compatable,
>I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade.  However, when all the dust settled, and I go into windows, it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was, in the Windows directory.  My question is:  How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive, and the permanent one doesn't?

you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my best
explanation.  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...

The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking
directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must
use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).
Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that
points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your
disk to index to information in that file.

compressed disks are actually "logical" disks.  These disks have different
characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information
on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must
go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating
system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this "inbetween" program, windows
cannot use direct methods to read from the "logical" disk.

a permenant swap file is only there to "reserve" an area of the disk that
windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically
not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't
know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you
boot windows.)

a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows
via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded
the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in
order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)

more on permenent swap files...

i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk
has seen the message "you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested
size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this
swap file anyway" or something like that.

well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.
what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and
divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block
of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.

They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows
uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he 
said!

I call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is
available to me if it's not going to use it?

any takers?

The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hard-coded
Winbench text into the driver. Clever, no? In any case, the Winbench
results are pretty much inflated.

When and if you get one send me mail.. I might buy that ATI GU+ off

They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET.INI and QVTHOST.RC are
incorrect (see below).

>The docs said if you are running concurrent packet software you need to  
>load PKTMUX???  Does this apply to me???

No, I don't think so. You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't
you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX)
should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using
different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently.

>This is the qvthost.rc file.
>137.112.5.2
>137.112.199.50

There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses.
Your file should look like this:

137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver>
137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router>

>This is the beginning of the winqvt.ini file.
>[net]
>name=swartzjh.test.rose-hulman.edu

Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part.

>router=137.112.199.50

Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC
I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also,
but  apparently they don't.

>nameserver=137.112.5.2

Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the
IP address.

It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than
one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to
three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.

Hope it helps,
Richard

Lots of drivers are available off ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/
drivers/video. I've tried two: et4cview.zip and et4turbo.zip. These
give you a choice of turbo and non-turbo drivers. The turbo drivers
were FAST but caused mouse problems with my machine (which has a
Diamond Speedstar card). I finally got turbo drivers (wndSpeed by
Binar) from Diamond. Amazing. Blazingly fast (for a non-accelerated
card) and best of all - no GPF's for a month or so...

Hi,

I have a problem when using subscripts with MSWord.  The
problem is the subscripted characters get cut off on the display,
but print out ok.  Anyone know how to fix the subscripts so
I can see them on the screen?

Many thanks,

Help!
I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language
characters (in this case Norwegian). I have been manipulating the data
with Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable
files to an RS6000 workstation.  The Norwegian characters show up fine
under Windows, but appear as "funny" characters on the workstation.  The
workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem
entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard. 
On further investigation I found that the character codes used by
Windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the
MSDOS code page.  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the
workstation.  What gives, and how can get around it.
Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few days
and will not be reading the news.
Thanks.

Hello,
	I'm having problems printing SPANISH characters with WFW2.  I was using the Celtic True type which has the accented characters, and used insert symbol to put in in the document.  However, when I put it in the doc, I get a big square character, and then it prints out just the same (to my dismay, thinking that was just the way it worked).
Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters?  I know WP 5.1 has this built-in, but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW2.  HELP!

There's a package called Workspace on cica that has 5 desktops; I
haven't done much with it yet, but it seems to be able to do what you
want it to.

Don't have the exact archive name handy, but it's something like
wspace<blah>.zip.

general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS.

NAME: COMP.DATABASES.MS-ACCESS

MODERATION: UNMODERATED. At this time, no need for a moderator has been
assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed.

PURPOSE: 
Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG
design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a
database programming language called Access Basic.
THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's 
WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
Access Basic to create complex databases.

RATIONALE:
Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical
Development enviroment and its initial low price.
Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices.
For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss 
their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.

	I'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows
common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app.

	Basically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then
with different files.  They all accept a file as a command line 
parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this
easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so
that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type 
in the file name).  

Problems are:

	1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it
would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the
file manager.
	
    and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried 
several directory levels deep.

	If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some
other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Tim

Two-part question:

1)  What is Windows NT - a 'real' windows OS?

2)  This past weekend, a local 'hacker' radio show metioned a new product
    from Microsoft called 'Chicago' if I recall.  Anyone know what this is?

That is it -

Thanks a heap.

I tried to respond by email, but all attempts bounced.

The condition of the Ctrl key BEFORE you press the mouse button makes no
difference whatsoever.  You have to be holding the Ctrl key when you
RELEASE the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation.

Here's a simple experiment.  Select a file and begin to drag it (no Ctrl
key).  Notice that the file's icon disappears from the listing window.  Now
watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the Ctrl key
(keeping the mouse button pressed all the while).  In addition, the icon
that you are dragging will show a "+" while you are holding the Ctrl key,
indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved.

Amishware has one included in their package. They were advertising here on the

	ahh, yes, this is a fun topic.  No, once the name is incribed on the
disk, that is it, it is encoded.  Not even a HEX editor will find it.  You can
write over the "Licensed to:", but you can't change the name underneth it.  I
think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate, and we're not
going to promote that here.

Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver?
Sorry, don't know the version of the driver (no indication in the menus) but it's a recently

if anyone else had seen this.

I think it was the IIT people who make the chip the card is based on who hard-coded
the string.

One of the weeklies looked into this an came to the conclusion that the IIT chip
was still pretty fast.

Hi,
  I have normal procomm plus for dos, but I've been considering buying
the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper.
I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here
using it, but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the
modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.  I can't
see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,
but the windows just seems to always screw up....Is this common
and is there a fix?  Or is something just screwed with his machine?

Hello,
  
  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I have
come across a few that look good:

  Zapp 1.1 from Inmark
  Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software
  C++/Views from Liant
  Win++ from Blaise

Some considerations I'm using:

  Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and
intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very 
important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows
programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with
the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the
sake of changing the API, are valuable.

  Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the
memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less
important. 

  We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch
components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff
 (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.

The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two
toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if
anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).

A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:

ZApp
----
  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and
    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.
  Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.
  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)
  Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)
  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.
  Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.
 
Zinc
----
  Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)
  Comes with a interface builder tool
  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)
  Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.  
  Had a better demo :-)

Both have source code availability options
Both are lacking OLE support
Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff


Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,

Thanks,
  Brett Harper

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space
limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is
concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.
The limit that causes the message, "Windows will only use ...," is the
amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will
create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have
when Windows starts.

In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:

	PageOverCommit=multiplier

The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:

	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of
	linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is
	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to
	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value
	specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the
	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data
	structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity
	proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a
	value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,
	you must edit SYSTEM.INI.

Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1, it does not 
run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true 
multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 
programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is
primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be
economical for most users.
	Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  
It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's 
just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs, 
and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed 
on CD-ROM.

Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements, 
and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the 
main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense 
competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will 
arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the 
client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together, 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).  
(Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't
scorn the concept.)
	Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be 
released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '96.
	With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)

Well, someone at Microsoft told you wrong.  Windows will use a swap file
larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft
Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information
that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book
they handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended
swapfile".  I'll quote the information

  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you
  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything
  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we
  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount
  of RAM on your machine.

So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You
probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only
telling you what little he knew.

Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the
opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually
incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and
optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer
you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick
up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.
That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You
could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself
I sprang for Word.

Well, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone
will go to a workshop and save a little money.

And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.
I need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)

Thanks,
Brent Casavant

The latest driver release is 59 and can be found at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
in the pub/pc/win3/... directory structure as pro59.zip.  I checked with ATI's
BBS last nite and there were no releases past 59.

We have the ATI Local Bus card and I noticed that I get garbage around the

I wonder if anyone can tell me whether or not I can create a bitmap
of any size?  I followed the bitmap creation example in SDK manual
and specified a 24x24 bitmap (set the width/height to 24) and supplied
a byte string with 72 chars.  But I just cannot get the right bitmap
image.  I changed the width/height to 32x32 and used the same value
string (padded with zero byets to make up to the right size) and
got the image.

The example in the manual is 64x32 size, which are multiple of 2 bytes.
Can you define a bitmap image of any size?

Thanks very much.

When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about
20 megs of swap file space, my 120 meg HD was nearly empty at that time.
I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded, now my HD is nearly full
and windows just took 4 megs.
I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your
permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size.  I have 4 megs
of RAM and windows took 4 meg perm swap file.  Works very well.
In fact with my available HD space, about 20 megs it won't let me make
the swap file any bigger.
You should change your virtual mem swap file to 8 megs I think
that is what you said your RAM was.

Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card!  My 9600 baud
modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X. I get
about 7 million WinMarks on my 386-25 and it just about keeps up with the
modem speed (using procomm plus for windows, too).  He should get over
10 million on his machine with the same card.  Anything 10+ should yield
acceptable speed...

We have heard many bad things about the ATI Ultra Plus card (mainly having
to do with its buggy Windows drivers).

I would like to replace by ATI Graphics Ultra with a true-colour accelerated
card. I was about to buy the ATI Ultra Plus (EISA) but it has had so much
bad press that I am reconsidering.


I would like an accelerated card
             a card that does 24bit true colour at 800x600 at least
             a card that does 1024x758 at 256 colours (or more)
             a card that has fast polygon fills
             a card that has fast bit blits
             a card that has a robust windows driver
             a card that has high speed non-interlaced refresh

Any suggestions?

My app requires lots of 3d poly grahics and complexing true colour
imaging.  I would sure like a faster solution that what I have now.

Thanks,

Al

Greetings!

I am looking pro a Win 3.1 printer driver for the Panasonic laser printer
KX-P4430. (I am not sure about the order of the first letters in the
name, but the numbers are right and they are important.) I have found 
drivers for Panasonic printers 4450 and so on, but I think there should
be drivers available where the 4430 model is included. 

Grateful for any help!

It also runs OS/2 character based apps and POSIX apps.  The DOS, 16bit
and 32 bit windows apps run in a windows 32 bit subsystem.

If you consider the fact that NT has:
 the Lanman redirectors,
 built in support for TCP/IP
 built in support for NETBEUI
 comes with TCP utils like ping and an ftp client, etc
 applications like schedule+ and a 32 bit version of msmail

the storage argument isnt an issue.

I ran it on a 486 with 8MRAM and it did a ton of disk swapping, with a 19M
virtual memory paging file.  It functioned but it crawled.  (this was the OCT
build)

I upgraded the machine to 16M and the performance is good,
At that point I installed the March Build.  Consider they
are probably still working on the feature set, and havent done a lot of fine
tuning to the code yet.

I have little info on Chicago so I cant make a comparison.  Is it in Beta?  Is
there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison?
Just my $0.02

Chicago from what I have read is projected to run in 4M on 386 and higher.
It is definitely aimed at the desktop. 
It  is rumored to offer preemptive multitasking,
multithreading but will not offer multiprocessing. Is 32 bit and no reliance
on DOS. It is rumored to have an integrated file and program manager. 
DOS 7 is rumored to be similar to Chicago but without the GUI. Is also
a step towards CAIRO (the next generation OS) which is rumored to be 
object oriented.
I wonder where Windows 4.0 fits here is it a stepping stone to Chicago?
Hope this helps.
Thx Dave L

I have the ATI GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO EISA version.  I must admit it has 
received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had.  Now the 
drivers that are available for the EISA version are the same ones as the ISA 
and Local Bus (v1.5 Build 59).  Some people complained about problems they 
had with the Build 59 drivers, fortunately I couldn't duplicate them on my 
machine, but I did have one problem with Harvard Graphics that nobody else 
seemed to have.

I wouldn't recommed the ATI for 24bit colour at 800x600, at this resolution 
the display will be interlaced.  But at 16bit it isn't, I thought it was my 
monitor but it isn't, its the card (that is the only time you will get 
interlaced).  If I come up with cards more suited for your needs I'll let 
you know.

How does Chicago differ from the (sort of) announced Windows 4. My understand-
ing, at least from the InbfoWorld accound of Windows 4 is that it's sort
of NT Lite--a full-fledged operating system but lacking server and security
features that make NT such a bear. Is W4 not true multithreading?

I have no trouble running Procomm for Windows at 14.4 v.42 on a considerably 
slower 486sx. Could be a video problem but only if he has incredibly slow
video.

You can change it. As part of a continuously downsizing Government
organization, my code (branch) changes about once a year. I just
finished changing the registration information using Norton Utilities.
I sent the original requester the hex offset into USER.EXE containing
the information, and his reply indicated he got several similar answers.

And it's not encoded in any way. As for the legality, there's nothing
that keeps me from changing the information; it certainly doesn't reach
out and alter the serial number printed on the inside of my manual.

Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have
used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource
converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially
the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.
With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,
this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,
and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So 
your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the
proper resource identifier.
I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does
use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel
for anything )

But the impressive performance of the Graphite was
not its Winmark, it was its Wintach result (esp. the paint
performance). Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly
imagine that there is a cheat driver for it.

As a followup, this is a co-worker's machine.  He has the latest 2.03 drivers.
It only happens using the 1024x768x256 driver.  Sometimes it takes a minute
or so for the cursor to wig out, but it eventually does in this mode.  I
susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants.  I excluded
a000-c7ff in the EMM386 line and in system.ini  The problem persisted.
Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components.
It is a 66mhz DX/2 Eisa bus with an Ultrastore (24xx?) controller.  Ah well,
I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it
before.  Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order, but I do find folks here
usually are far more in the know.

You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than
in DOS - regardless of what communication software you are using.

Try the following:
   1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The
       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine
       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.

   2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART's (8250 or 16450)
       can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART's (16550) can
       buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.  You can run
       \windows\msd.exe to find out what UART is on the machine.

Correction:  All Billy is promising is that it will run 'most' Windows 3.1
programs and the 'major' DOS programs.  Do not expect everything you
have to run under NT unless all you have are current MS apps.

Read your hardware manual for your I/O card.  There should be jumper

I had enough problems with my ISA bus Ultra Plus that I finally returned it,
but many of the people I spoke to through the net were happy with the EISA
version of the Ultra Pro.  I kind of suspect the MACH32 chip was designed
with a 32-bit external bus in mind and the ISA version is kind of a hack, but
that's just a guess.

What files do I need to download for GhostScript 2.5.2?  I have never used
GhostScript before, so I don't have any files for it.  What I *do* have is
gs252win.zip, which I downloaded from Cica.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to
work on it's own, but needs some more files that I don't have.  I want to run
GhostScript both in Windows 3.1 and in MS-DOS on a 386 PC (I understand there's
versions for both environments).  What are all the files I need to download and
where can I get them?  Any info would be appeciated.

As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  
late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  
day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  
can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  
application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  
that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  
need to re-boot.

Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  
first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  
GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  
(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  
machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  
the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  
the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  
was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  
board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  
SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  
fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.

The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  
rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  
the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. 

I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  
these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  
day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  
in the sppace of 20 minutes?

What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  
diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  
problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  
Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  
gdi.exe.

Any help is truly appreciated.....

One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous
(non-fragmented) space.  I suspect that is more responsible for the
difference than the amount of free disk, in your case.

It depends on what you are running.  We had to increase our swap
file (I think it is now 20MB) when some applications couldn't
run without *everything* else closed.

What files do I need to download for GhostScript 2.5.2?  I have never used
GhostScript before, so I don't have any files for it.  What I *do* have is
gs252win.zip, which I downloaded from Cica.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to
work on it's own, but needs some more files that I don't have.  I want to run
GhostScript both in Windows 3.1 and in MS-DOS on a 386 PC (I understand there's
versions for both environments).  What are all the files I need to download and
where can I get them?  Any info would be appeciated.

After setting up Windows for using my Cirrus Logic 5426 VLB GraphicsCard
It moved a normal Window from one place to another. 
My Parameters where just the following : 486 DX 33 VLB 
The Card is equipped with 1 MB Dram (not Vram, there are 8 sockets for Vram) 
And the moving of the window just looked like it looked at a friends
386DX 25 (387DX) and an normal ISA ET4000

What I was wondering why is it not using the BITBLT  Engine which
is suuposed to be on the Chip.

How are the experiences here..
Have I done something wrong ?
(I installed the MSWIN 3.1 MultiResolution drivers which where supplied 
with the Card ?!)
Would be nice if somebody could tell about his experience with this card
Also if there are new(hopefully faster) drrivers around I would love to 
how to get hold of them :-) (ftp or whatsoever :-) )

re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93

This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2
or DOS apps not running under Windows.

One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that
their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost
everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)
discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept
an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry
errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or
FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer
than with the old 2400bps modem.


There are three reasons for the problem:

1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most
   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the
   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high
   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and
   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded
   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.

2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and
   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely
   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you
   are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a
   16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance
   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the
   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve
   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn't even
   know what a UART was.

3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade
   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience
   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers
   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this
   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications
   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem
   by themselves.

If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of
the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid
overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers
were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem
card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they
are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.
Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.


The Hardware Situation.

The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250
or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace
them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft
diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*
bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from
accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.

The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with
configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to
460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in
pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access
cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but
it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,
see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.

So, what UART component do you have?

Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM
board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with
the numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,
and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE
your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket
COM board.

If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in
Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several
suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin
dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550
chips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).

Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those
of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various
IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states
support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:
National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552
Chips&Technology:       82C607
Texas Instruments:      t16c550a
Silicon Systems:        73M550
VLSI                    16C550
TurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,
says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70
systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).

If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-
market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you
may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to
either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to
COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).

Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the
problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology
MCT-AIO+ card from:

JDR Microdevices
2233 Samaritan Drive
San Jose  CA  95124
(800) 538-5000 voice US
(408) 559-1200 voice other
(800) 538-5005 FAX US

The MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit
ISA card providing:

Port Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments
COM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket

Parallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7
Game       ribbon

The kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM
port, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for
the ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can
be individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,
DCD, and DSR jumpers.

JDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.

I have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards
with 16550s:

TSD Systems
(407) 331-9130
$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.

Greenfield Trading and Distributors
(518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX).
Their card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.

PHONE: (407) 331-1424
FAX: (407) 331-8606
2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39

I have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,
and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based
8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set
the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.


The Software Situation

Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun
problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the
16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1
drivers have the following limitations:
 - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.
 - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt
   rate of 10x during uploads.
 - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2
   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).
 - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.
   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1
   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would
   be effective.
 - The API won't accept rates above "CBR_128000".
 - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even
   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit
   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.
 - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.
 - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.
 - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port
   speed options above 19200 bps.

These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may
or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).
Rumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0".

You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying
a copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from:

Bio-Engineering Research
Pacific CommWare Division
180 Beacon Hill Lane
Ashland  OR   97520-9701
(503) 482-2744 voice
(503) 482-2627 FAX
(503) 482-2633 BBS
MCImail:    344-5374
CompuServe: 71521,760

Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit
cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom
but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company
per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for
an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a
market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They
recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.

I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my
datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely
see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps
when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.
Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts
are still using antique UARTs and drivers.

Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu
in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets
around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will
set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the
Windows APIs and dialog boxes.

I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you
do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is
not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)
standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another
16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving
system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough
to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm
engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all
by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above
115,200 may still be risky.

Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still
experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and
serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to
buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a
16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of
TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine.
I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with
process priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose
thrashing system still runs into comm problems.


Closing Soapbox Comments

The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across
the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,
the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be
assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer
companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years
behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation
vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the
initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was
subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the
exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent
I/O.

You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this
situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect
cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of"
work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a
hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that
use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

Hi ... can anyone tell me where I can get a copy of updated Canon BJ-200
printer driver for Windows 3.1, if any ? I have ver 1.0 which comes with
my BJ-200 printer, I just wonder if there is any newer version.

Thanks very much, please email.

This may be a simple question but:

We have a number of PC's which we use to link to a mainframe using 
Novell LAN WorkPlace for DOS (via WIndows 3.1). 
Now, to make life easier for us we are thinking of using Windows for
Workgroups to allow file sharing across our PC network. 

Now does anyone know if it is possible to use W4WG and Lan Workplace
for DOS at the same time. 

ie Can I access a file on another PC while being logged on to the
mainframe at the same time, simultaneously.

Any help well appreciated.

	Ok, then where is the info for the Licensing kept?  Which file?  In the
organization box I put my address, and when I moved, I wanted to change it, but
couldn't find it.  I could find my name, but not the organization.

You are nto alone.  I get the same problems with my Panasonic kpx 1124i (24 
pin).  Oterhwise, it's a great printer.  I just can't find a driver for it, 
only for the non-"i" version.  Anyone seen it?

That isn't enough to change your Windows startup logo.  vgalogo.rle is not 
needed after you have installed Windows.  It is incorporated as a part of 
win.com.
	To make a new win.com, you have to concatinate three files together, 
using the /b option for a binary concatonation.  I beleive it is

copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.com

Make sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this 
-- I absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall 
Windows!
	Anyway, substitute whatever .RLE file you want.  The win.cnf has the 
info needed to start Windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has 
video information.  Just make sure that the .RLE file doesn't tip the whole 
COM file size over the 64k limit of a .COM file!
	So anyway, I use mywin.com to startup MS Windows.  Now instead of that 
annoying Micro$oft advertisment, I have the Joker (yes, from Batman) taking 
yoru picture from the screen, saying "Smile!"  Also a little bit of text: 
"Micro$oft Windows: The world's first commercially sucessful virus."  I added 
that because of the frequency of crashes. <grin>

Hi...

	THe best sound conversion program I've ever seen is SoundTool, which
is shareware from Germany.  I found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edu
a long time ago, but I don't know offhand what directory it was under.  It's
GREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, and
various PC formats... It's also a great player and editor, with various
special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame.  It requires a
driver for various sound cards... The only builtin one is for the pc speaker
(and even that sounds pretty good), but if you're just using it to convert
things, you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound
Recorder.

Give it a try!

On a similar note, has anyone found out a way to do this with MS FoxPro for
Windows? My setup.ini file was modified on disk 1 (all encrypted).. Well,
of course I forgot about Microsoft's stupid arrangement when I got the 
software, and used my name (it was paid for by the company I'm doing 
consulting for. When my job is done, it's their software).. Any ideas before
I start doing dumb things to a copy of that file??

Mattias
ps NO - I don't want to pirate this software. I just want to avoid having
to buy a new copy in order to change the registration information and then
having a copy lying around I don't use...

maybe I can get a new disk 1...

Our student association runs a small Novell network which has a subnetwork
of Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft Mail. The Director of Finance, en
electrical engineering student, would like to gateway this system, either
via SLIP or not, into the University's network and thus the Internet, at
the very least to exchange e-mail, but possibly also to do ftp's etc. For
now, this would be done via a 9600 bps modem.

He would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check
mail, but would otherwise connect whenever needed.

What is the best way to do this? Gatewaying software is available, but
what works best?

Please reply to me: dkmiller@unixg.ubc.ca
 or the D of F    : dleung@ee.ubc.ca

with a cc: to the other. I don't read all of these groups regularly, so mail
is best. If this is a common question, please pot me to a FAQ or ftp site.

Somewhere in this thread, it has been said that Windows NT (tm) is a 
multi-user OS, as well as multi-threading, etc.  I certainly haven't
seen this to be the case.  There are seperate accounts for each person,
and even seperate directories if that is desired.  I don't see an 
implentation of simultaneuos use though.

Have you tried setting FILES in your config.sys file to a fairly high
number? (I've got mine set to 100; I've seen numbers from 40 to 100 
recommended). Also check your STACKS statement, STACKS=9,256 is a good
starting point. Try increasing it if it's already set there (such as
to STACKS=12,256, etc.). Both STACKS and FILES have been identified as
_one_ cause of frequent Win3.1 crashes.

I haven't seen this particular problem, but another place you might
check is if your BIOS is doing video shadowing--Diamond wants that
turned off.  That might cause a memory conflict as well.  Good
luck.  Hope this helps, Chris Loschen, Brandeis U.

Does anybody have any idea where I could find a program that can
convert a .GIF image into a .BMP image suitable for a Windows

I use the Diamond SpeedStar 24X in 1024X768X256 mode all of the time.  I 
have NOT found distortions in the cursor.  The cursor is a little jumpy 
from time to time (due to 32 bit access to the swap file), but it is never 
distorted.

Yup.  We're using both and they work just fine.  Hopefully, someday WFWG
will communicate over LWP TCPIP.  Right now we have to load NetBeui.

I use ODI with ODINSUP and all works well.

While there are too many PS clones to count, some of which are quite poor,
trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require
some patience. Three questions come to mid real quick for something like
this.

Q:	Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?
	Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released
	new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other
	software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure
	you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to
	dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to
	maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.

Q:	Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?
	From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had
	a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding
	which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.

Q:	Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?
	Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's
	PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does
	leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be
	nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two
	different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given
	an identical set of conditions.

Q:	PSCRIPT.DRV?
	Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of
	testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary
	source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,
	(1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,
	but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe
	uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its
	wrong.

Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub
of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack
of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor
because the vendors don't know what PS is.

Hi, everybody:
    I guess my subject has said it all.  It is getting boring
looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows.  So,
I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file
I can share.  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for
some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files,
etc....  I used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all.

Anyway could me give me some help, please???

thanks a lot!

  I've been told that Panasonic has uploaded some to Compu$erve, but I
don't have a CIS account.  I just use the Epson FX-80 driver myself,
and it comes out very pretty (if very slowly) on my 1080i.

look on ftp.cica.indiana.edu for gws.....zip. They embed the release
number in the name, and I'm not sure what the lates is. It is Graphics
Workshop. There is a DOS and a Windows version. Both work Great. I even
had someone bring me some images from the Amiga, and converted them to
great looking wallpaper as 256-color .BMP files

If you can't find it, repost, or let me know, and I'll dig up the archive.

But a disk compare utility (old versus new) will.  And Windows 3.1 is
also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files
onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them
less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.

No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to
corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like*
dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the
registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to
be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour
reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one
way or another.

So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the
procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:

1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want
to install it.  I've been using c:\WINSTALL myself.

2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\WINORIG.

3.  Install from c:\winstall.

4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  
    i.e., comp *.* \winorig\*.* >\report.txt

5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming
they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one
file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate
said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex
editor, and do the same for the modified one.

6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't
really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I
think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing
his copy than with "real pirates" who will probably just disassemble
the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about
any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original
floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able
to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a
compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).

As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and
don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one
directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff
I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if
they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you
could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a
disclaimer.

Have at it....

Sporadically, yes.  It seems to flicker, or change shape into snow
briefly.  Not enough to impair functionality, just call attention to
Diamond's professional sloppiness.

I have an IBM and run Windows 3.1.  A friend installed Norton Desktop For
Windows on top of this.  It loads automatically when I type "win", and
surely adds to the (already dismally slow) process of starting up.

I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program!!

I have taken it out of win.ini, but it still pops up running with windows.
I did a big search and found reference to it in ndw.ini, system.ini and
progman.ini.  Removing it here causes a failure when starting up windows
(progrman.ini has a "group 7 = ...ndw.exe..." which can't be deleted.)

Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off??

I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1
but though all the applications display the font correctly on the
screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly
(on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer).

When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assume
CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer.

But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square
boxes in place of the characters of the new font. Yet, Write does
display the font correctly on the screen.

I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere.
All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print
exactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a font
has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????

Appreciate any help....

    1. Get the friend to uninstall it.
    2. Read the manual (though from your post I infer that you are using
    pirated software.)
    3. Go into SYS.INI and change the SHELL= line to read SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE

The 5426 has its own set of drivers. You may be using the
drivers intended for the 5420 or 5422 by mistake.

Be sure you have the 5426 driver version 1.2

>(I installed the MSWIN 3.1 MultiResolution drivers which where supplied

Don't quote me on this one, but I'd steer clear of the
multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution
without exiting Windows.  I think it's buggy.

Version 1.3 drivers are due to be release by Cirrus soon.
Unfortunately, their not available via FTP, you have to dial
up their BBS in the USA.  I do this from NZ using a 14.4k modem
to cut down on phone bills.  It took me around 7 minutes to 
download the v1.2 driver.

I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550C from Word
for Windows.

History: when I had a Deskjet 500, I had to modify the macro so that
it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that
interferred with printing envelops.  That bug is still present, however...

Now: the problem I have is that my DeskJet 550 print driver (came with
the printer I bought in December) still wants to print the envelops in
PORTRAIT mode.  However, the DeskJet 550 feeds envelops the from the
narrow end (i.e. landscape mode).  How do I get the printer to print
the envelops in the correct orientation?

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not post this to the net since:
    (a) due to end of the semester cruch, I can't keep up on these groups,
and (b) I will summarize the best answer(s) to the net anyhow!

Here are some cool 3-D background patterns I made.

Edit your CONTROL.INI and add the following lines to your [Patterns] section.

Bricks=148 43 86 172 89 182 99 201
Tile=1 43 85 43 85 43 85 255
Tile (diagonal)=148 107 54 156 73 182 99 201
Slats=0 170 85 170 85 170 85 255

Make sure your desktop color is one of the standard 16 colors or the
patterns might not work.  I like dark grey the best with these.

If you have any cool one's of your own, please mail them to me.

This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft
admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver,
but I've found it to be pretty generic.

You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold
in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of
pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts
instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able
to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your
printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a
different value.

The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that
might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not
smiling.)

Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review:

1.  Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown
    by the Graphite and #9GXE's "cheating".  Can't they just admit that
    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach
    is much harder to beat...

2.  The big "cheat" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and
    PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't
    do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing
    PC Magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn't they
    at least make some comment about its real-world performance?

I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve
Gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx
Draw to benchmark).  If you believe Gibson, that is ... :)  He writes:

    "Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world
     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than
     any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it's
     just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I
     have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the
     ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB."

This kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench
or not!  :)

> When and if you get one send me mail.. I might buy that ATI GU+ off
> you.. 9-)

I already returned the ATI GU+.  My dealer had sold eight of them, and 
seven were returned to him.  I'm now (temporarily) back to running an
original ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in
my 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where
you use BitBlits).

Hercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you
can buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.  At
just $199 for Graphite or $249 for the VLB version I decided it was worth
trying (I'm supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks).  I'll post
my impressions when I get it...

I am curious:  what does the /double_buffer parameter in smartdrv actually do
for me?  I seem to have less problems in Windows when I leave it out.

Using a PS/2 with an ESDI drive, but also a PS/2 with a SCSI.

Any response is welcome.

Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELP.EXE file?

I have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran
Norton AntiVirus for WINDOWS.  It indicated a possible unknown
virus in the WINHELP.EXE file in both the MWINDOWS and WINOS2
directories.  Neither file changed since I installed my OS/2
system in January as far as I know.

Any information about this possible virus and suggestions on
remedies would be greatly appreciated.

	Hello

I have a question about the demo files for amipro v3 uploaded in cica.
I downloaded it and tryied to install it.  However, it didn't work.  
In addition, it altered or eliminated my NWRES2.dll file so that I had
to reinstall my Norton Desktop again.

Is there anything I have to know to install it or do I eventually have 
to ask Lotus to send a working model to me (I heard that they have it)?
I just want to see its look and feel before buying it.

Any pointer would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you

Hello fellow 'netters.

I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I
should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.  I
thought, rather than trust the salesperson, I would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential.  And, I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson.

Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360
dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi).
Which is faster?  Is there a noticeable print quality difference,
particularly in graphics?  Which will handle large documents better (75
pages or more) -- any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here?  Which works better under Windows 3.1 (any driver problems, etc)?
Cost of memory, font packages, toner cartridges, etc?  Basically, your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable,
both good and bad.

Advance kudos and thanks for all your input.  E-mail or news posting is
readily acceptable, but e-mail is encouraged (limits bandwidth).

To all hardware and firmware gurus:

My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a 
physically handicapped relative of mine.  My goal is for this keyboard
to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system.
This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World
at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the
hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be 
expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of
you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be 
willing to point me in the right direction. 

I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives
most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes 
and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it 
leaves a number of important questions unanswered.
1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm
    guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either
    event, how is the data framed?
2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex
    since the host can turn LEDs on and off.
3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT
    keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?

If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of
information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com.
Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in
the event of a booboo.

Thank you for your time.
Danke fuer Ihre Zeit.

The Microsoft Founation classes (afx) that come with C/C++ 7.0 (and 
Visual C++) are very good, they already have a version for NT,
it comes with source code, and is very close to the navtive API.
It also as some classes to manage data structures...

hi,
  Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x? If the answer is positive, you would
know if ms-windows is a "mature" OS.

  Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why
they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft
simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:

(1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group
    in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.)
(2) Too many system parameters to take care of. 
(3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes
    an unpredictable error.
(4) Group deleting/file deleting
    After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.
    But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full
    of nonsense files.
(5) share problem
    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some
    language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just
    can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to
    prevent from saving, but not opening.

Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make 
ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs; 
the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose
of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier 
to use.
  
  It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to
keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more
carefully before products distribute.

  No flame, please.

Jesse

you Need gs252ini.zip and 24*.zip, and 25*.zip font files. You can get these
from  wuarchive.wustl.edu /mirrors/msdos/postscript. I also advice you to get
gs252gui.zip from CICA. It is a nice interface for ghostscript. Ghostscript is
very user unfriendly. This interface makes it user friendly. For using this
interface you have to get vbrun100.dll (from risc.ua.edu /pub/network/misc)
copy this to your windows directory. Copy gui executables and other files to
your ghostscript directory. And anter the line below to your autoexec.bat.

SET GS_LIB=C:\<your ghostscript and gui directory>

Now you are ready to use it. Enjoy it.

	First of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is
a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed
to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so
much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not
 justified...
Please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time (by the way c.o.msw.misc is
OK :) ). Now as far as your problem is concerned: try playing around with
the settings in the 'Fonts..." dialog box under the window control menu (that
little square at the top left corner of the window..).

To get hierarchical icon groups in MS-Windows use Norton Desktop for Windows.

MS Windows in not mature. It's lousy. But its supposed to be lousy. It's
goal is to be ubiquitous not good. MS-Windows is the
course for the masses in IT Infrastructure 102. (DOS = 102, CP/M = 101.)

Unix was the course for the cogniscenti in IT Infrastructure 101. Together
they prove that there is good effect of good IT, and there is good effect
of ubiquitous IT. What we need, now is both at a significiantly higher
level of function. POSIX + DCE + CORBA + ????? ? See the problem?

NT may be IT Infrastructure 103, but it will also be IT Monopoly 102. (101
was IBM.)

We have a conundrum, gentlepeople. What are we going to do about it?

Dear friend,
  The RISC means "reduced instruction set computer". The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance. You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC.

Hello.

     I purchased a video card called ET-4000 true color card which
     can provide about 1700K colors. But the question is I can't find
     the corresponding drivers for windows 3.1 , I am now using 65k
     colors driver for win31. It works fine , but I think it will be
     better if I use 1700k driver. So, please tell me whether such a
     driver is available !

     Thanks in advance.

	Hmmmm, why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of
those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win" and might even end up as "OS/2 Vs Win".
Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which
case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge... 
First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try
to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and
shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself
thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace-
ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will
even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan
does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do
that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda
hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not
paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet
story ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons
not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :)..
PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your 
settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities
from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in the
discussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- they
are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writing
this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) )
By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under
the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS on
a PC !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )...
Just trying to avoid another Mac-Win war...

Microsoft Windows v3.1.  I have the SB driver set up properly to play
normal sounds (.WAV files, etc.).  I want to play midi files through the

How do I set up Windows so that I can play MIDI files?

Hi there,
I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1.  I have a 286 with
a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver
with other similarly configured computers.

I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.

The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start
changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open
a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have
any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially
return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.

Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the
design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but
the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.

The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark
purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the
screen gets refreshed again.

If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell
network, everything is fine.

I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the
other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this
machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine
and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried
reloading Windows to no avail.

Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!

Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!

It certainly is multi-user. What I have seen from the March Beta is
that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user
features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow
two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user
per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. 

I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third
party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the
net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like
csh on Unix for remote logins. 

In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to
Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being
slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems
also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was
right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing
around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using
a "business computer" from IBM or some other established vendor, I
would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much
cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides
the robustness such an application requires. 

On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget
about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats
the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a
networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your
machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32
based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.
I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32
becomes widely available.

I know you said E-mail preferred but because this is a common problem
with WPWin I'll post it here.

The screen only LOOKS like the text is gone. Usually you can just
page-up then page-down and when it does a complete refresh the
text reappears. I have had--on "rare" occasions--to completely 
exit (save first) the program. When I reopened the file, all chaos
had been resolved. I don't know WHY it does this, but it is annoying.
The graphics problems have now made me a Word for Windows user!!

  I am sorry. My card can display about 17000K colors not 1700K colors.

  I hope some one could answer my question !

Hi,

  I recently bought an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280+. It's a real nice card,
but I'm having very big problems with it.

  The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display
in windows. Something like every other line or so.
Also, when I use a DOS gif viewer, namely vpic 6.0c, in Fahrenheit 1280
mode, vertical lines are swapped. It's very strange looking.
If it uses VESA standards, however, it works great! only it thinks there's
only 512K on the card. (There's 1MB on there).

  I have contacted Orchid support, and they tried to be helpful, but didn't
have the answer. I don't think the card is the problem, since it works great
on my friend's computer.

  Here is my setup:
Fahrenheit 1280+, 1MB, bios 1.1
386-25, Opti-chipset2, AMI bios 1990, 5MB ram.
Maxtor 120MB harddrive, (slave)
Maxtor 40Mb harddrive (master)
Panasonic c1381 monitor,
version 4.6 windows drivers.
windows 3.1
I tried taking all memory managers, etc off, and took all other cards
(besides disk controller) off.

  My friend's setup is 386sx-16, shamrock monitor.

If anyone has seen anything like this, or can otherwise help, I will be very
greatful.

Please send e-mail to tdarugar@tartarus.ucsd.edu or

Tony.

Hi there,

With a 16Megs of RAM, is there a need to run/load Smartdrv for
Windows 3.1?  If yes, can I run/load Ramdrive without Smartdrv?
If I need both Ramdrive & Smartdrv, is the following Config.Sys
settings OK:  ...SMARTDRV.SYS 2048 2048
              ...RAMDRIVE.SYS 2048 /E

Thanks in advance for e-mail reply.

Does anyone know the phone and fax number of the Asymetrix
Corporation. I am also interested in their e-mail address.

I would also like to know what the current status of their product Toolbook
is. I received the last update 1.5 about 1.5 year ago. Are their any new
developments or is Toolbook slowly dying?

Regards,

Rob de Winter.

As I can recall, you can click on the upper left button of dos window, then 
choose font to change. Also there is a demo window to show you in advance how
the font you choose will affect the size of dos window. Make  a try!

I have (had) several problems with the card.
- Applications crashed when moving the mouse (VGA mode). Fixed by removing
  the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256
  does just fine.
- Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a
  256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning
  off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics
  mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.
  With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the
  window.
- The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware
  cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.
  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-
  for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-
  unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?
- The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal
  VESA drivers do not run at all).

In Windows I created a permanent Swap-file of 7771Kb as win3.1
recommended me to do that (32bit access).
If I use EMM386.EXE, after win3.1 startup I have 6689K of memory
free, if I leave EMM386.EXE out of my config.sys I have 9935K
of memory free, and windows recommends me a swap file of 11769K.

I use DOS6, with memmaker, have 4MB of internal Memory and a 486DX,

Does anybody knows why this is happening (possibly win needs
some UMB's to manage virtual memory?, If true, which UMB's, those
that EMM386 can find without including suspicious parts?)

I need an optimized DOS-environment, because i develop applications for
DOS using a windows programming environment.

I just put one in my machine last week.  I have an AST 486/66.  I was
getting ~10million winmarks with my Diamond SS24, and the #9 board is
doing ~20million winmarks.  From my brief experiences with it, i'm very
satisfied.  BTW, this is with Win 3.1.

HI there!  I have a few games that I'd like to run under Windows 3.1 and can't
get the PIFS adjusted right.   For example Wing Commander.  In my DOS Prompt, I
have more than 620K available for programs.  This is enough to run WC.
So I build a PIF giving WC a couple of megs of extended memory etc.. and run 
it.  WC prompts: "Loading Wing Commander..." and then a message about 
"Using extended memory..." etc... and then my screen goes black (just before
the opening scene-the orchestra-would have appeared.)

I also have a pool game that does almost the same thing.  It opens up and
prompts me for what kind of video driver I have.  (CGA, EGA, etc...)  I
respond EGA and the screen goes black.   

On both of these a ctrl-alt-del getss me back to Windows.  

Has ANYONE run Wing Commander under Windows?  Or has had the problems I
describe and fixed them?   HEre's the rest of my setup:

	400MB Disk Free
          8MB memory   ~5 free during WIN session
        386DX-25
       
Respond here or on E-Mail.   If anyone else needs this info, send me mail in
a couple of days, and I'll forward the replies to you.

hmm... not that I am an authority on RISC ;-) but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large.
The difference is in addressing modes - RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC.

I've been using MS Access (still available from some stores for $99.00)
and I am quite pleased with it.  It's relatively easy to learn, very easy
to use and somewhat easy to program.  I highly recomend it, particularly
at $99.00!  I have not used Paradox for Windows, but I don't expect it to
be $30.00 better than Access (IMHO).

Hello,

I have a 386sx25 notebook with windows 3.1 running fine. WINWORD 2.0 and 
QUATTRO-PRO for windows also work fine when no virtual memory is used. 
Switching on the virtual memory option these programs (probably others too) 
don't work, the system crashes. The same programs work well with arbitrary 
virtual memory on two other desktop PC's. What am I doing wrong?

If you can help, please mail to me directly, if possible.

Thank you very much in advance.

Stefan

Can someone out there tell me how to switch Window's screen resolution
quickly and easily?  I know that I can go back into install to do it,
but what I'd really like is to have is the ability to just change a
couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
changed.  I already have both video drivers that I need on my system,
so that isn't a problem.
 
Thanks,
 
Sean.

I have an Okidata 2410 printer for which I would like to have a printer driver.
Has anyone seen such a thing?  There is not one on the Microsoft BBS.
I can print to it from Windows but I have no fonts available and with

I am looking for a WIN31 driver (or set) for my Diamond 
Speedstar 1MB video card. Does anybody know of an archive
site that has these? I looked at CICA and it had drivers for
the Stealth card and for Generic ET4000 cards but not one 
specifically for the Speedstar. Is there one? Or has Diamond
dropped the Speedstar out of the driver development loop.

Thanks for any info,

Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a
fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense
of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have
to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how
things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are
taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups. 

Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and
run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI. (Yeah, I know
about X-Windows, just haven't been too impressed by it...)..

The control box of the Window itself (upper left corner of the window, single
click, am I being too simplistic?) has a font option. The 8 X 12 is about the
biggest one I can use without the characters turning funky. 

Hpoe this helps.

Windows NT or WNT can also be derived by the next letter in the alphabet
of VMS - same as HAL and IBM. You might recall that the chief architect
of VMS is also chief designer of WNT.

As far as I have read WIN NT will be supported on Intel, DEC ALPHA and the MIPS R4000
series of processors only. I do remember though reading a rumour about Sparc support
sometime in the future. I am not sure what you mean by running "unix applications".
You would have to have SAS for WIN NT (or maybe SAS for WIN16 etc). I have read 
that MS will anounce avalaibility of WIN NT by end of May 93 (Comdex Spring). Hope
this helps.

There is a way in SYS.INI to turn off RAM parity checking (unfortunately,
my good Windows references are at home, but any standard Win reference
will tell you how to do it. If not, email back to me.) That weird memory
may be producing phony parity errors. Danger is, if you turn checkling off,
you run the slight risk of data corruption due to a missed real error.

I hope this will clear it up :

(Taken from one of my lecture notes)

 " ...  The alternative approach (to CISC),
 which has been adopted by many in
 recent years, has come to be known as "RISC": the Reduced
 Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as
 "Simpler is Faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing
 the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be
 designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more
 instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,
 faster design.

 A typical RISC processor will:

    o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);

    o perform all data operations on registers;

    o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');

    o only allow load & store operations to access memory;

    o only use a few instruction formats;

    o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).

I downloaded the CompuServe GIF of the month.  A raytraced image of
a golf ball next to a hole.  Very nice, 640x480x256 bitmap, easily
converted to a Windows BMP.  If anyone wants, I could upload a copy
on Cica...

Hi all,

has anybody tried to compile CTRLTEST from the MFC/SAMPLES directory,
after compiling the MFC-libs with BWC ?

Seems to me, that BWC isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded
functions.
For example, imagine the following 2 (overloaded) functions:
void same_name ( void ) 
void same_name ( int )
 
After trying the whole day, I think, with BWC its impossible to take the
adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined
function pointer. 
Am I right ? Has anybody else had this problem ?

	thanx

John White from STAC Electronics can be reached at compuserv as 72370,1005.
For me 72370.1005@compuserve.com would as email address work from Internet.

HHHHEEEELLLLPPPP Meeeeeee!

	I installed a 256 color svga driver for my windows last week.   
This driver was downloaded from ftp.cica.indiana.edu specifically for  
Paradise svga card.  However, after I installed it and when I run windows,  
the startup screen in the beginning becomes the old windows 3.0 startup  
screen ????!!??!!

	Everything works fine except the startup screen.  I know the  
startup screen must have been changed in the system.ini file (or is it ?)  
but I couldn't figure out what to alter!   Can some one help me with this?   
Please e-mail to my address:

	thang@tree.egr.uh.edu  or  thang@jetson.uh.edu

In addition, can anyone know where can I get a 1024x680 paradise svga  
driver (256 color) ?  this is a used computer and I do not have anything  
(drivers, etc) regarding the driver....

thanks in advance.......;o)

If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, I strongly 
suggest Approach 2.0.  It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I
own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to 
build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have
heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic.
Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/
home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I 
have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily:
I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must 
be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to 
use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records 
appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)
exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach 
database), and then copying the exported files back to the original 
filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really 
like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than 
the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also 
takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).

The Diamond BBS has these.  Their 2400 baud BBS phone number is (408)
730-1100.  Their 9600 baud BBS phone number is (408) 524-9335.  Sorry,
I don't know of any FTP site that has these (though I'd be surprised if
there wasn't one).

	Hmmm, let's see: I could upload some .BMP files (I have around 15
b/w and color ones), but I'd rather give you the fishing pole instead of the
fish:Here it goes:  
      Begginers guide to the coolest Windows backgrounds:
Step 1: ftp to cica (ftp.cica.indiana.edu user:anonymous passwd: guest)
cd to pub/pc/win3/(util?desktop?) and get one of these : wingif14.zip,
pspro??.zip gws?????.zip . They will scale, dither and convert GIFs to BMPs.
get the index file from the win3 subdir too for future reference...
Step 2: ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu or plaza.aarnet.edu.au or archive.orst.edu
and cd to graphics/gif GET THE INDEX FILE... Now GigaBytes of pictures
are waiting to become your desktop... 
Advice: If you have a slow computer (<486DX w/4MB RAM), make your bg b/w
by selecting b/w dither in any of the abovementioned apps..
Hope it helps...

I think you may be chasing the wrong problem.  I don't think it is the
function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time
in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in
porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of
invalid C++ assumptions.

I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but
the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in
which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are
getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the
owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all
other pieces of ctrltest work fine.

Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:

- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,
  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ
  between MSC and BC).

- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++
  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place
  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for
  references).

I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have
not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope
that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's
hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.

      If these were my employer's opinions, I wouldn't be posting them.

I had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only
worked while I was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting
windows, however,the problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms.  I can't use 3 chip simms in my 
computer, and when I replaced them, the problem vanished, forever.

According to the April issue of PC Magazine (pg. 139), and I quote,

"Eventually, Windows NT is likely to be ported to every successful RISC
architecture.  PowerPC and HP's PA-RISC are the two most likely candidates,
with SPARC somewhat less likely because of Sun's relatively strong UNIX
software base."

As I remember it, the name of the program your looking for is called icofrite. 
 Cica was where I saw it last. It was quite a while ago.

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC
processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is 
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications.
As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has 
certainly proved that.

What I want to know, is what does this have to do with this group?

a "sound.exe" file that claims to be the driver but I'm suspicious since
it's not a .drv file.

Try sizeit.zip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu [129.79.20.84] in the directory 
ftp/pub/pc/win3/desktop. It's freeware.

Also noticed there a program called sizer110.zip, which from the description
looks like it also does what you want.

Hope this helps.

Hi.

While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1 
this evening, I got a "program has violated system integrity... close all 
applications, exit windows and restart your computer" error.

I started to do this when I immediately got a "Serious disk error" message
from Windows.  "hit return to retry".  I did that about 5 times and then
rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow.
(I am including the chkdsk output below.)

Questions:

1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order?
What might be some better approaches?

2)  What might have caused this?  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more
vulnerable?  (I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they
cache data writing.)

The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to 
fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows
and a few other things.

Thanks for your comments and suggestions.

Brad Banko

ps:  this is a 386sx machine with a 40Mb hard drive and 2 Mb of RAM.

Hi!  I will like to know if there is a FORTRAN library for MS-Windows v3+ out
there.

I have several lots of source code written by past A/Ps in MS-FORTRAN, and
recently have needed to port them to MS-Windows... I would like to avoid a
major code-rewrite if possible - maybe a WINDOWS library is all I need?

Please help - reply by E-mail to:  traversmorgan@swell.actrix.gen.nz

Has anyone else been playing with that wincmd utility from PC Magazine?
If so, I am having trouble concatenating string variables together and
need your help.  For example:
temp = "path"
temp2 = "file.ext"
fullpath = temp+"/"
say fullpath			// output = 'th/'
fullpath = fullpath+temp2
say fullpath			// output = 'h/file.ext'

So, it seems to be dropping the first few characters with each
concatenations.  Is it that I am out of memory -- I only have maybe 20
variables total -- the article didn't mention memory limits. 

email me if you have an idea or would like to see the actual source and
output.  Thanks for your help.

I just got a copy of Tobias' Managing Your Money v9.0.  I have Quicken 6,
and it's wonderful for some things, but MYM seems to have some features
that Q6 doesn't.  For example, Q6 doesn't seem to be able to handle
monthly automatic deductions from a checking account (you know, a
monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from
my checking account).  Or is there something that I'm not doing right,
and Q6 can actually do that?  Anyway, MYM seems to be able to handle
monthly deductions.  In fact, it can apparently do better than that.
That is, you can specify monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, even yearly.
Anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs?
Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions?  Maybe
someone who has used both.  Or maybe someone who is familiar with
each could give me a capsule review?  Anything would be greatly
appreciated.  If I keep MYM, I have to pay for it, and I don't know
whether it's worth doing.  If MYM is better than Q6, of course I
will keep it.  But if Q6 can do everything MYM can do (maybe even
better), I won't.  Thanks all!

Hey now.  First of all, sorry to post this DOS question in a WINDOWS
group, but I'm in kinda a hurry, so I can't scramble to find the dos
groups' names.  

Anyway, anyone know where I ccan find the exit codes to DOS commands?
the manual doesn't seem to have all of them.  I'm particularly looking
for COPY, in order to make a "move" batch file, such that if the file
wasn't coppied properly, it won't be deleted.


please e'mail louray@seas.gwu.edu
Thanks, I.A,

No not at all. I'm using SS24X with BIOS 2.03 and driver

mouse cursor.
Is there already a newer driver published?

I am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the
process of planning a small accounting system for a small business.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a
different office of the same building, each having access to a
Windows-based accounting system.

My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the
machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet
cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one
additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase
a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or
M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with
a report/check printer attached to it.
Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.

Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus out
there tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, however
trivial, will be immensely appreciated.  My apologies if this has been
brought up before.

Thanks!

Theoretically supposed to be reduced.... not any longer.  That's why everyone
is arguing about RISC v.s. CISC.  Personally, I think CISC will win out.
Just take a look at the Pentium!  (Not that I like Intel architectures either,
but that's another story...)

We had a similar problem in converting a .EPS file. The solution was simple.
We changed the first line from %!PS-Adobe-3.0 to

%!PS-Adobe-2.0

This fouled the converter, the .EPS file only contained very simple 
move and draw statements.

Hi,

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HC.EXE or HC31.EXE file to 
compile and generate .HLP files out of .RTF files.
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W.

If this is not the solution be more specific about your application.

There are a couple.  I am personally using screenpeace, which is a
screen saver which will also select your wallpaper from a specified
directory (not necessarily the windows dir.).  Let me know if you want
info.  I've been pretty happy with screenpeace, and the latest version
(3) is *not* at cica, but  oak, /windows3/scrpc3or.something

Hi,

I got a problem too, with a 486DX2-66 VLB, 4 Mb RAM,  170Mb disk.
Sometimes, when I switch on the computer, it starts Windows (3.1 Dutch)
Windows switches to 1024x768, switches back to text-mode and exits
to DOS. After one or two resets, the system works fine...

Thanks

Hi,

I have a 486/66MHz SYS based PC with 8M RAM and a problem.

What is the best way to configure high memory with QEMM/386MAX ??
I have a SPEEDSTAR 24X video card and use Hyperdisk disk cache
software. The problem is running Windows 3.1 in Enhanced mode and
having any high memory to load stuff high?

Note :
I tried, as recommended to exclude the region A000-C7FF but Windows
insists on starting in Standard mode.

Any suggestions?

Hey, sounds great. Does that mean that W4WG works with ODI? I thought it   
uses NDIS.                                                                 
                                                                           
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my   
UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work      
along.                                                                      
                                                                            
I read in a German computer magazine that TCP/IP support for W4WG is just   
around the corner. Anybody have any news about this?

Hey, sounds great. Does that mean that W4WG works with ODI? I thought it    
uses NDIS.                                                                  
                                                                            
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my    
UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work       
along.                                                                     
                                                                           
I read in a German computer magazine that TCP/IP support for W4WG is just  
around the corner. Anybody have any news about this?

If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short
program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function.
The bad news is that you need VBRUN200.DLL to run it, and the DLL is
some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). The order of pictures depends
on the system date and the number of BMP-files in the directory, so
the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times
during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed.

If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email
it to you. (It is unavailable via ftp.)

There's a program called "Icon Frightener" included with the book Stupid
Windows Tricks by Bob LeVitus and Ed Tittel (Addison-Wesley, 1992).  It's
freeware.  If it's not on the net anywhere, I'll happily email a copy to
someone who's willing to upload it (I can't upload through our Internet
firewall).

Hi
I'm having a problem with TrueType fonts in WIndows 3.1. I have installed
the Cyrillic fonts I found on CICA and now a strange thing happens:
Sometimes windows uses Cyrillic when its supposed to use Times Roman.
Examples: The PC-Tools Backup (version 7.1) has one line of Cyrillic text
in its opening banner, the next to last line. Importing a Word for Windows
text written in Times into WP5.2 also results in Cyrillic.
Does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem?
Thanks

Hi
     I have never used MYM so I can not help you with the comparison of the
two products.  I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you
how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First
use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. 
Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions
and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken
will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you
do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be
entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will
remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have
three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month,
middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.

Mike

Software that comes together with the VideoBlaster
is designed to work together with the SoundBlaster
(from the same manufacturer).

Since I do not own a SoundBlaster: is there a possibility
to use the PC Speaker driver to play audio files for
the VideoBlaster (.AVI = audio video interleave files) ?

I think what I should have is a device driver for
the Media Player that controls the PC Speaker Driver
instead of the SoundBlaster card (something like MCISPKR.DRV).

Has anybody heard of such a driver?
Or am I on the wrong track?

Any information on this appreciated!

I have a small Windows program which I can not get to work; 
The program looks vaguely like this:

=============================================
char f1[80];

int WinMain(...
{
  lstrcpy ((LPSTR)f1, "Hello");
  ...
}

long far pascal WndProc(...
{
  lstrcpy ((LPSTR)f1, "Hello");
  ...
}

============================================= 
I am using large model under Windows 3.1; after linking without
errors, the RC program said

Sorting preload segments and resources into fast-load section
Copying segment 1 (53679 bytes)
RC : fatal error RW1031: Segment 1 and its
     relocation information is too large for load
     optimization. Make the segment LOADONCALL or
     rerun RC using the -K switch if the segment must
     be preloaded.

Using the -K switch seems to interfere with the proper function of
the second lstrcpy call... can anybody explain what is going on and/or
how to fix it?


Thanks...

Unless I am completely misunderstanding you, try using either Notepad or
sysedit.exe (found in your system subdirectory) to edit you .ini files.

The sysedit.exe program is cool because it automatically opens you win.ini,
system.ini, autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be edited.

I just got off the phone with Mathsoft technical service. They
are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with Maple and
Norton Desktop for Windows. They have no clue at this time
and are collecting configuration information on the systems
which exhibit the problem. Anyone having problems loading the
Maple solver in MathCad 4.0 under NDW shoud call technical
support at 617-577-1017. They made no schedule promices,
but are actively working on the problem.

In the meantime, the workaround is to provide a configuration

Since swapping out my generic VGA card for a Diamod Speedstar 24X, I have 
noticed two new problems:

* if I create a windowed MS-DOS session (386 mode), when the text starts 
   to scroll, rather than printing characters it starts to print
   horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire 
   display.  Ctrl-alt-del terminates the dos window and restores the 
   desktop

* after a short time in NCD's PC X-remote for windows, all characters  
  displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable; I am unable to
  restore without rebooting.

These are in both 256 and 16 color 800x600 drivers, large and small fonts.
DOS 5, Win 3.1, emm386 and smartdrv installed.

I like the speed of the card and have had no other problems.  Any ideas?
Thanks!

Please excuse if FAQ but...
New Trident 8900CL based card claims to have 1280x1024 support.
Drivers with card indicate several 1280x1024 drivers on diskette.
Windows 3.1 does not make all drivers on diskette available to

In Windows 3.0 there is a built-in called sysedit.exe that is just what you

Walther,
I'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card
and screen would have without flickering. I'd only suggest using the color
screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. If this is not too small for
your tastes at a 14"....
Personally I'd prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windows
open. If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the
color 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size. If you want to
develop programs you will always have to check the colors. I used a
14" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked
I choose on a color screen.

Olaf Winkelhake

I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card. Some have
been positive but most are negative. Could people please confirm
these?  (I am interested in the EISA version in particular).

1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.

2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches
   set but it is much slower.

3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.

4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many
   cases.

5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.

6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)

Thanks for your feedback. I will summarize.

I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
questions about Windows for Workgroups.

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with
Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1).
I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG.

Q1:  How much conventional ram does W4WG use over and above the
     driver for the network card?

Q2:  If I have a Novell NE2000 card, are the LSL and IPX drivers
     still needed?

Q3:  Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG? (Note: I do
     not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy
     of W4WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies.)

Q4:  If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace
     all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current
     Win 3.1 files?

Q5:  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have
     any troubles with the W4WG machines?

When I started this message, I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carried
away. I'll stop now ;-).

I look forward to your replies.

Al

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]

Hi,
	We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a
serial printer (dmp or Laser). I have used Works and Windows Write. The
output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output, but anything
fancy garbles or just doesn't output. The exception is outputting to a
Lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to
bother about handshaking messages. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I've
tried most of the Print/Network manager options I can think of. Anyone
had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it??
Thanks

John Atherton

PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance
management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World,
December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.
I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your
library.

I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have
several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My
overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager
while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your
finances.

Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:

	The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:
	checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile
	your account statements with the records the program keeps.

	The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that
	budget.

	A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill
	paying service to pay your bills via your modem.
	
	The ability to print checks on your printer.

	The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.

	The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts
	up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically
	via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.

	The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation
	programs.


Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that
Quicken does not:

	A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to
	predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine
	tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.

	An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep
	records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.
	It can also compute your life expectancy.

	A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, 
	effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to
	maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and
	loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you 
	decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford
	a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good
	investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether
	a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.
	This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping
	your kids with their tuition.  

	A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets
	and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this 
	information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules
	are automatically included here.

	A "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file
	you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital
	information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a
	rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment
	list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to
	track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list
	can be made to display automatically when you start the program.

There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost
sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure
hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.

One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a 
Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version
of Managing Your Money for release late this year.

I hope this information is of use to you.  I've found Managing Your Money to
be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand
I know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all
the features you need or want, I'd go with it. If you find any of the Managing
Your Money features that Quicken doesn't have to be useful, I think it's well
worth the price.

This is silly. Is Unix a mature OS? Depends on who you ask, and how
you define mature. System 7 is, if anything, less mature than Windows 3.1.

So why do you need something like BeHierarchic to create groups under
the Apple Menu? Everyone knows that Apple Menu Items are a ripoff of
the Program Manager. If you want a hierarchic program launcher there
are lots available.

And this is easy on a Mac? Give me a break. Having spent hours moving
System Extensions around and restarting the Mac to see why a certain
app crashes all the time, I find this laughable.

Oh great. Ever hear of aliases? Wonder why Apple implemented them.

The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB
and EISA version should have no problems.

Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM
(EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.

Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all
non-interlaced.

They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which
I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due
to software incompatibility.

It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.

I like it.

I just got Mathcad 4.0, and the manual is not clear on the matter.  On page 8:

	:
	:

* At least 4 megabytes of memory.  All memory about 640K should be configured
  as XMS.

	:
	:
* At least 8 megabytes of virtual memory....

Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it (4+8=12 < 16) but the
new Mathcad is kinda kooky, and thus is not subject to the laws of common
sense...

We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been using
W4Wg for a while now.  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail
package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport
package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they
require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc
for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another
dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail
going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.  

There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it
is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the
mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a
Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail
is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.
Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail
on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.
Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header
then a message saying "Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)".  If you
can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people
of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably
the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one
support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I
am looking vigorously for a better Idea.  

If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please
drop me a note - anyone.  The next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip
built in THEY say........  The netxt itteration of w4wg

Good Luck!!!!!

Hello,

We are having troubles using the PC/TCP onpredir (printer redirection program
with lpr support) with the Windows print manager. The onpredir simply waits
an do only the capture till the end of the Windows session, while after some
printer inactivity  it should start the printing.
 Does anybody uses this two programs together?

                                Thanks,

I've been reading, with much confusion, about whether or not to use
ATManager. Lately, all the packages I've been buying have all
included ATManager as a "bonus"
I do some desktop publishing using PageMaker and Coreldraw.
Coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 200 diff
types. Add that to the TTfonts that come with win31 and you have a
decent amount of fonts. I print my creations out on an HP4
Postcript, at 600 dpi resolution with the "Resolution Enhancement 
Technology" and ..  well ... I get some darn good copies. 
So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned
on or not. Is it worth it to run ATM at all? Especially with these
better printer technologies ... and TT?

RISC used to mean "Reduced Instruction Set Computer", true.  They
still use the same acronym, but only to be familiar.  What RISC really
means is a recently-designed CPU.  :-)

In general, most RISC CPUs are like this:

    A large number (32 or more) of general-purpose registers
    A fixed instruction size, usually 32 bits
    An instruction may make only one memory reference
    Memory references must be aligned
    There are delayed branches (branch after the next instruction) or
a target prediction bit (probably will/won't branch)
    Instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction
stream

Sorry, I did`nt tell exactly what I need.

I need a utility for automatic updating (deleting, adding, changing) of *.ini files for Windows. 
The program should run from Dos batchfile or the program run a script under Windows.

I will use the utility for updating the win.ini (and other files) on meny PC`s.  

Do I find it on any FTP host?

I have the local bus card also, and don't have any such problems with it
now, but this is the second card I've gotten - the first card didn't work
in VGA mode correctly.  Maybe they still have some quality control problems.
I would suggest checking with ATI (I went through the vendor I bought the
card from since the problem showed up immediately).  I never was able to
get through to ATI's technical support number.  

I sure like the way the card performs though.  I have the 2MB ATI ultra
pro - local bus, and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode.

This doesn't sound right to me.  I have an ATI Ultra Pro VLB card with 2MB
VRAM, and I'm pretty sure it is not interlaced at 800x600 in 24bit mode.  I'm
at work right now so I can't check it out, but I know that when I set it up
the utility let me specify non-interlaced for this mode.  And I haven't 
noticed it the couple times that I have put the card in this mode in windows,
but I could be wrong because I very rarely use this mode.  For most of my
applications at home 1024x768x16bpp is what I use.

I have the ATI Ultra Pro local bus with 2MB VRAM, and I am perfectly happy with
the Windows drivers (currently using version 59).  It does everything you
mention below, but also does 1024x768x16bpp true color.  As a matter of
fact it also supports high refresh 1280x1024 at 256 colors.  The performance
is great.

Supposedly the new Matrox Ultra-something-or-other actually does some
3d rendering (at least has some hardware support for Z).  Good luck in
your search.

Preface: I am a novice user at best to the Windows environment.

I am trying to execute a MS C++ 7.0 executable program which accesses a Btrieve
database to build an ASCII file.  

When I execute it under windows the screen goes blank and my PC locks up.  The only
way for me to return is to reset the machine.

Does anyone have any insight on what I may have to do in order for the program to
correctly under windows?  (By the way it runs fine in DOS 5.0)

System:  Gateway 486/DX250 
	 ATI Graphics Ultra Card 640x480

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The original RISCs had small instruction sets, and simple ones. The
idea was that a) every instruction should be completable in a single
clock cycle and b) to have no microcode and c) extensive pipelines.

A few comparisons (from Patterson: Reduced Instruction set computers.
CACM V28. 1, 1985):

CPU		Year	Instructions	Microcode
---		----	------------	---------
IBM 370/168	1973	208		420Kb
DEC VAX 11/780	1978	303		480Kb
IBM 801		1980	120		0
UCB RISC 1	1982	39		0
Stanford MIPS	1983	55		0

While researching for the VLSI VAX, DEC discovered that 60% of the VAX
microcode is there to support 20% of the instruction set which
accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. The uVAX 32
subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software
emulator for these very complex instructions, the full VLSI uVAX
included the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but
only ranm 20% faster.

CPU		Chips	Microcode	Transistors
---		-----	---------	-----------
uVAX 32		2	64K		101K
VLSI uVAX	9	480K		1250K

Subject:    Norton Desktop Smartcan vs. Norton Util's EP
Lines: 22

I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows, and I also have
Norton Utilities.  When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line
that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility.
It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the
version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the
Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however,
install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:
   1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.
       i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?
   2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?
       I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I
       erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.

From the experiments I have run, The two programs (Erase Protect and
smart Erase) don't use each others info.
I currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec, and
I don't see any conflicts;

FYI :  Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.2
       Norton Util's version 6

Thanks for any help.

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and
characters on each side, which is useless.

I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.
Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however!!

Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred
character?  Has anyone been able to get this character displayed
from a CorelDraw TTF?

You do not need the SDK. What you need (and can get free) are

Location: ftp.cica.indiana.edu
index:      /pub/pc/win3/INDEX

First get /pub/pc/win3/uploads/what.zip (~1.3M) This contains the help
compiler among other things. It is free from Microsoft.

Then get these (I think these are free too)

dir:	/pub/pc/win3/programr
files:  hag.zip, whag.zip wfwhlp.zip

These are shareware

dir:    /pub/pc/win3/util
files:	hwab21.zip, qdhelp.zip, qdtool.zip

dir:	/pub/pc/win3/winword
files:	drhelpev.zip (macros for word 2.0 to convert doc to hlp files).

  Here is an annoying problem. Whenever I save an icon which contains dark
colors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the
bright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the image
editor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files
either; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with
the icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file
with a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the
colormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can
fix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem? 

Thanks.

Well, in the latest Windows magazine, there is an advertisement for a program
that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk (Uninstaller)
but it can be used to update a network, but only for deleting, not adding
or changing their *.ini files.  (Uninstaller, by MicroHelp Inc.  $79
1-800-922-3383)

I am also looking for an *.ini updater for my PC network, and so far without
any luck.  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and it's batch
language to its limit...look into DOS 5.0's (I am assumming that DOS 6.0
has the same command, maybe even more..or less..improved) REPLACE command.
I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
file that is run everytime they invoke Windows.  This basically overwrites
their color schemes, but does what I need it to do.  Not neat, but does
the job...I'm looking for a better solution though.

Presumeably, you mean without a _permanent_ swap file. If Windows needs a
swap file, it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't exist.
Permanent is generally faster though. I don't know why Mathcad wouldn't
be happy with either type--Ver. 3.0 is and so should any program conforming
to the Win specification.

Hmmmmm you know this happened to me also.
I am not sure what caused it.  I think there might have been
a system error and dumped windows.  I came back and all was well
except no groups. Program Manager was EMPTY.  All the .grp files were
in the directory.  I had to remake the groups with the new and group
selection.  ALL THE ICONS AND FILES INSIDE THE GROUPS WERE STILL THERE
AND WORKING FINE.  Just the groups had gone out of program manager.

There are some fonts that are only available as PS fonts.  If you
have a PS font that you want to use, use ATM.  Otherwise, it is
a waste of system resources.

Personally, I use both.

I have used both version 1.17 drivers for Win 3.1 and the new 2.03 drivers.
I have had none of these problems.  No GPF's at all.  I have a feeling that
your problems are not with the card or drivers.  The ATI Ultra drivers are
considered some of the most reliable on the market, and the SS 24X ones 
seem quite good as well.  Maybe you should check BIOS problems in your
Gateway.  I know a few people with Gateway DX2's, and all of them have
found some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics.

The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using/
abusing applications.  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when 
people started complaining.  I still only have one small problem with
them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/
reads to the swap file.

What the status of Trumpet for Windows? Will it use the Windows sockets ?
I liked it in DOS but had to abandon it since I started using NDIS to access

Hi folks,

At the end of the summer I'm planning on getting a new computer (486DX50 or
486DX2/66) and have been poking around in Computer Shopper.  Anyway I saw
the ads for the Diamond Viper (Local Bus, 2MB memory, 50 million+ WinMarks)
and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it (good/bad/not worth
the money/etc.)  Any information at all would be nice.

Also, a few other questions.  Anyone know of a good cheap 15"+ 1024x768 NI
monitor?  And what is a good CD-ROM drive that meets MPC standards and is
controlled via SCSI?  How about a 250MB tape drive on SCSI?

Thanks for your time,
Brent Casavant

No. When the program is run, it loads 4 configuration files; autoexec.bat,
config.sys, win.ini, and system.ini. There is no Open entry on the File
menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other
program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.

I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was
just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The
reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals
about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry
under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for
internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice
multi-file replacement for Notepad.

It is a bug in the driver (the first driver (containing _many_ other bugs)
didn't had this problem). You can work around by disabling the hardware
scroll of the card.
Just type "24xmode scrolloff" before starting windows.

While I do not speak for Peter Tattam, I am fairly sure he is planning a 
Winsock compliant version.  While this will definitely not make the initial
public release of WinTrumpet, it will follow on shortly thereafter.

Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta.  It looks like an excellent 
product, with several features beyond the DOS version.

WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP, Novell LWP, and there is also a direct to 
packet driver version that some people are using with the dis_pkt shim.

When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows
to dos, telix can not find the serial port. If you have some ideas on how
to solve this problem or where I can find further information, send me email

Hi there,

We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.

Every once in a while, we run into "The Black Screen of Death", a phrase
coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.  

Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and
you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your
screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs.
Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows'
virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company
seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.

Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?  

Is there a fix for it?

Any response is welcome.

When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows
to dos, telix can not find the serial port. If you have some ideas on how
to solve this problem or where I can find further information, send me email
or send it to the news group.  Thanks.

I am getting Garbled output when serial printing thru Windows & works
etc.  This has occurred on several systems and goes if a LaserJet 4 is
used.  I suspect that there is no need for handshaking in this case due
to the capacity (memory/speed) of it.  There is no problem printing from
DOS.  Are there any obvious tweaks I'm missing.  I'm sure its not JUST
me with this problem.  Thanks for reading....  John Atherton

To clarify a little more: SOUND.EXE is a self-expanding archive which
contains the driver (which is actually called SPEAKER.DRV, I think).

Reposting and summarizing, for your information or additional comment.

*** THIS IS LONG ***

I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and
a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).  I have been running
Mathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive,
2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for
several months.

I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4.0, but I am concerned about reported
swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increased
speed.

TO 386SX USERS:

  Will Mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that I use a swap file?

So far, in response to a less detailed description of my setup, or in
unrelated postings, the more informed answers, on the net or by E-mail,
appear to be:

One difference will _probably_ be the same difference as between OS2 and
Windows 3.x now--one will likely have a lot of software available for
it and one won't (emulation, with the inevitable incompatibilities that
crop up in spite of all the contrary claims, just doesn't count when you
_have_ to use a certain software package that doesn't quite run properly
under the emulation...). Developers want to channel their resources toward
a platform that has a large installed base, and in a case like that the
platform that is most successfully _marketed_ (regardless of its relative
sophistication) will win.

TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in

Hi.  I am having some interesting problems with my Boca graphics card, which 
is based on the Cirrus Logic chipset (I am not sure exactly which one).  The
problem is as follows:

If I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver (ie
16 colour or 256 colour), the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of
resizing on the monitor will make it fit.  And if I use Excel with the 64K-
colour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads.  Anyone out there used this
card/experienced anything similar.

Please reply by mail, and I will post any solutions here.

Regards

  - Simon

I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently.
Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I
guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get
an exact byte count.

Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating!
If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'.
If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes', 
not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only
893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say
3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying
more than 3 characters!

My system: 486DX/33, 8M memory, Stacker 3.0, DOS 5, Win 3.1.  I've run
the latest virus scanners (scan102, f-prot) and they didn't report anything.
Could I have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting
of the status bar in the FileManger?

Gawd, I love Windows :-)

You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them

You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a
swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky
stuff in a PC environment.

A reasonably accurate prediction...


Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:

There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,
and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined
notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.

The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,
and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not
important right now.

The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find
the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the
number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it
holds a "magic" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad
(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster
contains the next section of the file.

The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.
The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is
doled out in "chunks" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster
is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.

To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the
starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.
Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will
tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.
Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump
around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a
time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker
which says it's the last cluster in the file.

CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of
the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into
submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to
double-check anything it "fixes".

Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:

>C:\GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE
>C:\GFX\VPIC46\VPIC.TXT
>C:\GFX\VPIC46\VIDEO7.CFG
>C:\GFX\VPIC46\ORCPRO2.CFG
>C:\GFX\VPIC46\VGA.CFG
>C:\GAME\GOOSE\BIRD2.X
>C:\WINMISC\ADV21\WINADV.EXE
>   Allocation error, size adjusted

All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match
the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter
the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the
directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.
But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,
obviously, are made up.))

>   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains.
>    647168 bytes disk space would be freed

Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached
to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these
"lost chains" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK
through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell
CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply
be marked "available" in the FAT.


>C:\GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE
>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133

...

>C:\386SPART.PAR
>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133

These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,
one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that
C:\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...

To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.
This will "fix" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.
Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to
assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  "Missing pieces" are
likely to be found in those "lost chains" at the top...)

>  42366976 bytes total disk space
>   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files
>    153600 bytes in 67 directories
>  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files
>   1564672 bytes available on disk

Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of
the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an
amount which exceeded available disk space...

In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.
There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage
after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the
problem occurs.  Sorry.

	I assume you're using the driver available from cica (hp4-v108.zip).
Bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel. Click on the
"Options" button brings up another screen of choices. Change the "Graphics
Mode" from "HP-GL/2" to "Raster" and check the box "Print Truetype as graphics
(this is only available when you choose "Raster"). Now you should be able to
print all your truetype fonts correctly. Good luck.

To those interested in the new ATI Ultra Cards:

I had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and
had asked confirmation of some opinions.

This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that
replied.


> 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.

a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB
   and EISA version should have no problems.
 
b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't
   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way
   of switching the "memory aperture" feature off to prevent this,
   but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some "help me" messages
   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this
   problem.

c) FALSE

d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M
   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.

   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.


> 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches
>    set but it is much slower.

a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM
   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. 
 
b) Dunno.

c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus


> 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.

a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all
   non-interlaced.

b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version
   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.

c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.

   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to 
   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color
   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.


> 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many
>    cases.

a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which
   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due
   to software incompatibility.

b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.

c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain
   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they
   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..
   other accelerated cards also have bugs.

d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than
   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my
   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.

   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond
   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on
   the old driver.


> 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.

a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.
 
b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what
   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)
   every 20 minutes or so...

c) Depends on many many things.


> 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)

a) I like it.

b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.

c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)

d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are
   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.
   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer 
   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was 
   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)

   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.
 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this
group so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar
with the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don't have
an Graphics Ultra yet.)

ATI Graphics Ultra Plus:
- Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours
- True colour(16.7M) at 800x600
- Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)
  Stretch full motion video windows to full size
- Fast VGA
- Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only)
- Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think)
- Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop
- Around a 1/2 length card size
- Priced from $400 U.S.

ATI Graphics Ultra Pro:
- Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus
- Faster performance with VRAMS
- Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced
- Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel
- Priced from $600 U.S.

ATI Technologies
(416) 756-0718

I hope this summary can be of use to you.

Al

P.S.  I am not associated with ATI Technologies in any way other
      than having used their previous ATI Ultra card for a few
      years (which I generally liked).

Hi.  My last question for the year.  I have a mail-order no-name notebook
with 4 meg ram.  I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when
running desqview, but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me, most
commonly citing a "memory parity error."  The only thing I can do is TURN
OFF and re-boot.  My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup,
and there is never a problem with this either.

Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware?  I remember
having some disk error problems when installing it.


Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of
this happening (I think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both
crash frequently nonetheless)

I know this is a pain, but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account
doesn't have rn.  And I will stop asking questions now.  Thank you.

Hi, I was wondering if anyone out there knows of any books that give helpful
hints and tips on writing thesis papers in WfW.  I know about the dissertation
template that comes with word but I want more.  I would like to have tips on
how to use all the {seq ...} , {bookmark ...} , {index ...} , { chapter ...},
fields that are available in word.  I have looked through the help files,etc.
but they really don't explain a whole lot.  I will post the results(That means
email me first) if I get a lot of different suggestions since I think this
might be of help to lots of crazy grad students such as myself. Thanks.

How are you attempting to do that?

Are you using the DIS_PKT9 program? This provides a packet driver on
top of the NDIS driver.

If you are managing PC's on a Novell network, get the network management
tools provided by either Sabre Software or Automated Design Systems. 
Among the many features, you'll find utilities that can help you to
manage .INI files stored on users' workstations or home directories. 
This is commercial software and well worth the money.  To date, I have
not found ANYTHING available via FTP that could compare.  Reply to the
address in my .SIG for more info.

I have a 386/33 with 8 megs of memory

I have noticed that lately when I use programs like WpfW or Corel Draw
my computer "boggs" down and becomes really sluggish!

What can I do to increase performance?  What should I turn on or off

Will not loading wallpapers or stuff like that help when it comes to
the running speed of windows and the programs that run under it?

Thanx in advance

Hi,
  I am working on gathering data on the way that users use
computers. This involves getting subjects to type and use a 
mouse. I want to be able to watch what they are doing without 
being in the same room. It would be ideal if I could watch
the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge.
I believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for
short distances, ie <5m. I will need to be approx 10m away, as
the cable travels.
  The PC's are connected to a TCP\IP network and run Windows 3.1.
Is there any software that will allow me to watch what is 
happening on another PC?
Thanks
Regards
  Jon Gough

Trying to pin point a hardware problem with my disk, Maxtor
7213AT.  Group files get corrupted on a regular basis.
Only happens on this drive, D had only one corrupt file
in over a year and it was under the control of winword on C.
32-bit disk access and smartdrive are off.  Since installation
of dblspace problem has turned from an annoyance to a reason for
murder.

Since the most frequent files corrupted are the *.grp files,
are these the last thing written to when exitting Windows?

Also, are there any pd/shareware utilities available that do
a more thorough job than dos 6, NDD 4.5, etc?  DOS 6 and 
Win 3.1 compatable.

Thanks

There is a shareware program called v-switch.zip. I don't remember if it  
is on wuarchive.wustl.edu or on ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  

It is easy to use and does the job with no problem.

The sound.exe is actually a self extracting script which includes the .drv

Again, I do not speak for Peter Tattam, but it is my understanding that it 
will shareware status as Trumpet 1.05 for DOS is, and I imagine that the 
registration fees will be similar.  I also believe that a new version of 
Trumpet for DOS will be released sometime in the near future.

I think you need the EMM386.EXE noems
This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any, therefore
this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the
bases covered.

Very simple.  You have to have the MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS loaded in DOS
before you run Windows.  Note that you don't need to have these files loaded
to use the mouse in Windows.

We had problems with mouse drivers using W4WG where Windows 3.1 didn't, seems to be 
more critical about it. It was actualy a port problem with the network card running on 0x2e0, we changed it to 0x300, now everything is allright, I think it has to do with the AMI Bios as well.

1) make sure your hard drive is defragmented. This will speed up more than 
   just windows BTW.  Use something like Norton's or PC Tools.
2) I _think_ that leaving the wall paper out will use less RAM and therefore
   will speed up your machine but I could very will be wrong on this.
There's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things
up.  good luck

It sounds like something/one may have set the 1000's separator to "." in
Contol Panel (under International).  This makes 23,482 look like 23.482
and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of
the file size. 3,356,345 becomes 3.356.345, and again, File Manager is
confused by the decimal points where there should be commas, chopping
off everything to the right of the first period.

    uses all of the above and knowledge about my investing philosophy to

I've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because I have the same requirements you do......and the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com1 and com2 using irq4 or irq3 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has them.....I've talked to Mouse Systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com1 and com2 as above , but who claim to be releasing one that will SOON!??.

The other alternative seems to be possible, but in one case prohibitively expensive, i.e. 4 port card for $600??????!!, and in the other, the author(s) of PowerBBS for Windows claim to have a 4 port serial card with buffered 16550 UARTS and drivers for windows to match (i.e. com3 irq5) for $120......

The second paragraph is hearsay, because I haven't checked it out yet.....but intend to as soon as I can free up $120 <g>

Hope this will save you some steps.

ATM will do nothing for your TrueType fonts.  If your TrueType fonts are
sufficient for your needs, don't run ATM.  I have a lot of fonts that I can
install either as Type-1 PostScript (under ATM) or as TrueType.  I have
noticed that:

    1.	TrueType font files are at least 1/3 larger than their Type-1
	equivalents.  If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware
	that TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type-1 fonts will not
	(they are encrypted).

    2.	With a 300 dpi laser printer, the "artificial bold" version of a
	TrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to
	install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if I want
	to use them.  Type-1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually
	distinct bold variant from the base font.  I realize that the
	artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior
	to the hand-generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient
	for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50%
	on disk space (uncompressed).

I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate

I'd like totally separate virtual machines.  I'd be willing to settle for
less, and may end up having batch files that copy .ini files around
depending on who wants to use the machine.

at home is Kermit for binary files.  I'm running Kermit on the workstation at school and
setting the file transfer protocol to binary.  I am unable to upload files
to school but can download files from school to home.  During download,
Terminal displays ther retrying message several times then the message '
Verify you're using the correct protocol'.  
	Anyone have any ideas on how to fix?  Either e-mail or post to this

Are you using Fastopen?  If you are, disable it.  We had a lot

Greetings!
   
I've had a bunch of problems with the 24x.  Opening a DOS window on the
desktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set of
horizontal lines, hashing the entire desktop.  Nothing can recover this 
except to completely exit from Windows.  The other irritating problem is
that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually
scrolling, as if a CR was printed without an LF.  This seems ONLY to happen
to communications programs, but I can't nail it down any further than that.
Note, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating.  Even
just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in
these programs causes the problem.
   
   Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows, WPwin would sometimes
blow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of
the problem.  I've still seen this, but only once or twice with WPwin 5.2.

Are there any Workspace Managers out there for Windows 3.1 ?
By a Workspace Manager, I mean something like the HP APOLLO Workstations
have - multiple workspaces under X.  There is a window at the bottom
of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces.
It overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one
screen.  Instead, you can spread them amongst different workspaces
which act like independent screens, and you can flick between them.
Thanks in advance.

WFWG does use NDIS but it cooperates well with the NDIS shim for ODI.
(I've heard that it is as fast as NDIS direct)

The additional TSR load is minimal.  I think I eat another  20K total.
This is worth it to me since it allows me to get to my Windows NT 
box.  Novell hasn't released a decent NT Novell client yet so I share
through my WFWG box.         
                                               
This solution is very usable.

One addition to this... I don't know if it applies to everybody.  For my
(Microsoft 400dpi) mouse to work with windowed DOS apps, I had to use the
driver that came with Windows (Version 8.20).  8.1 didn't allow me to do
it for some reason.

I could never find the Microsoft mouse driver on my Windows 3.1 installation
disks, but DOS 6.0 also has version 8.20 of MOUSE.COM.

Organization: Fine Arts and Communications -- Brigham Young University

I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00 (was using 8.20 
I think, but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better).  Vertical motion 
is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around.  I can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again (maybe this time to the left about .5 inch!).  This is crazy!  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before.  Anyone have any solutions?  

Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be? <- just venting steam!

Apparently, Microsoft came out with a new product: MS-Braille it is suppose 
to be "WYTIWIG".  :-)

  Uh... slight clarification:  That should be a printer driver for the

I posted a similar query and got these replies which I am testing (so far so
good)..

* turn hardware scrolling off before going into windows (24xmode scrolloff)

* in the pif file for dos window, set "emulate text mode"

* get the latest drivers from the DiamoND BBS (or cica): dates are 1-20-9.

For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows....
also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse,
both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows 3.1 will support it. 
both of these are 16 color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of
your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a
mouse.

You may have to define your serial ports under windows (I think it's the

If you install the Soundblaster windows drivers correctly, and have
the latest drivers, the media player should be setup to play files
authored to Microsoft's Multimedia midi authoring standard (General
Midi), see the section in the back of the Voyetra manual in the
Soundblaster midi upgrade kit.
You'll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different
mappings, so don't expect them to always sound correct without using
some kind of midi file editor, such as Voyetra's Sequencer Plus.

You can attempt to use the midi-mapper to remap the patches for
soundblaster, but since you cannot modify the sbfm.drv you are allways
stuck with the instruments that come with this driver.  Unless you can
find an editor for making modifications to the instrument settings in
sbfm.drv , I would suggest you locate the early version of
soundblaster drivers that were mapped to mt32 voices, and the later
drivers that are mapped to the general midi voices.

Hi Everyone,

I would like to get an example program(source code) to get started with a simple
editor (similar to windows dialog editor, but lot simplified) . Can someone
point me to a source such as a programming windows book, or example program
comes with Windows SDK (from Microsoft or Borland). I would greatly appreciate
it.

All I want to do is to be able to place a edit control or combobox or a listbox
on a window and be able to drag and resize.

If anyone has written similar program and don't mind sharing code or ideas, 
I would appreciate it very much.

Thnx in advance, Manu Das

  You can try defraging your disk more often. It definitely will
 help speed things up. A 2 megs smartdrv is also a good idea with
 the amount of memory you have, and use fastdisk (32bit access) if
 you not already. Hope that help..

Is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle
a compressed IDE drive without screwwing it up?

Need to document occasional failures in reading/writing,
check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors.

I believe that all of my problems with DOS/Windows can
be isolated to my drive.  Getting occasional corrupted
files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off.
Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C.
Drive D may have had one failure, but that file was
under the control of Win/Winword on drive C.

All utilities available to me report no problems.
DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took forever
on C, and kicked me out with a suspension till NDD run
6 to 8 times.

Thanks.

Sorry for the followup, but I couldn'y get email through on your addresses.
I, too, am trying to decide between these two printers, and I would like to
hear what users of these printers have to say about the questions above.

Try WorkShift by Karl Thoreddson. The latest version is 2.0 (or later?) but
the following is at Cica in the Desktop directory.
WRKSFT16 ZIP : WorkShift Graphical Virtual Desktop (ver 1.6)

Or email Karl and ask him to put version 2.0 up
Karl's email: karlth@rhi.hi.is (from the MS-Write file of v1.6)

I was Beta tester for WorkShift and must say it is very good

I edited a few newsgroup from that line (don't like to crosspost THAT
much).  I can't compare the two, but I recently got an HP DeskJet 500.

I'm very pleased with the output (remember that I'm used to imagens,
laser and postscript printers at school -- looks very good.  You have
to be careful to let it dry before touching it, as it will smudge.

The deskjet is SLOW.  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned.  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares.

The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I've not
had any problems with it.

Hope that helps some.

I have a .BAT file that I run under a Windows Icon.  I have set up a PIF
file to run the BAT file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen.
The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable.

My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows
3.1 in enhanced mode), the SET command in the BAT file fails with the
OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment 
space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that
I am nowhere near to running out.  If I just click on the MS-DOS icon,
I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.  The problem
is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in

You could use DOS 6 to do this partly.  You can set up different config.sys
and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their
menu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini
and system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows,
it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.

This is the only way I can think of.  There may be some programs somewhere
that allow you to do this better, though using DOS 6 allows each person to
have a custom config.sys and autoexec.bat.

Ok, I have a problem that I thought you guys/gals might know about....

I'm running a 286dx-25 with a 85mb hdd.  I also have windows 3.1, but
hardly any dos application will run out it.  Also, when I do a "mem"
command, it says that I have used up 58kb out of 640kb of conventional
memory, zero from upper level memory, and all 385kb of my ems memory.
And to top it off, I can't load any device drivers into upper memory.
Do I just need more memory?  Also, why would it use up ems memory instead
of upper memory?

Please reply by e-mail only to :  wes1574@tamvenus.tamu.edu

Since we are in the subject, I have one more question. I have a Trident
8900C Video Card. I want to know what is the latest video driver for it.
So far, all I can find is that an old driver dated Aug. 92 in garbo.uwasa.fi
Anyone have any info ? Please e-mail me at axh113@psuvm.psu.edu

   -----Or, if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use
   Type 1 fonts. From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting
   TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in
   the first place.

Unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the
final output device (image setter).  A problem with TT fonts in Windows
is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used
while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result
is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the
printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look
good when printed at a different resolution.  

So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up for
this printer results, may be quite good.  But if you take a PS file made for
that printer and run it on a device of different resolution (such as an
image setter), then the results may not be so good.

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the 
sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The 
BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare it 
with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (
depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not 
being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since 
Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.

I quit windows normally to run a special DOS app, got done with it
and tried to start windows.  Ok got the title screen, Windows
background, DOS with an error about loading PROGMAN.EXE.  Hum, yep
PROGMAN.EXE is still there.  Must be bad, ok pull off PROGMAN.EXE
from a backup tape, start windows, get the windows title screen,
windows background, DOS with the same error.  HUM!  Fire up the
good ol' Norton Disk Doctor, test, 500 lost clusters!  Ok, fix them,
and look through them, doesn't look important.  Remove the Windows
directory, and reinstall from disks.  Fire up windows, title screen,
background, Program Manager, Success!  

I have a 486/50 (Amy) with 4 meg of RAM, 120 meg HD, SVGA, running under
DOS 5.0, no special memory managers or stuff, just the basic Windows 3.1
A 12 meg permanent swap file using 32-bit Access.  I mainly use Windows
to run more that one DOS app at a time.  (ie downloading with Qmodem
with a DOS window open, and possibly POV running in the background.)  

I've noticed that since I started using Windows a few months ago, lost
clusters have gotten more and more common.  Although I don't like
having data just disappear, it really haven't been a problem except
for today.  Has anyone else had any problems with lost clusters while
running windows?  And what could I do to fix the problem, I'd sleep
better knowing Amy wasn't loosing her marbles. :)

I am using DOS Quick C 2.5 in a DOS window under Windows 3.1, and the other
day while I was running the compiler, I got a general protection fault
immediately followed by a "serious disk error".  When I rebooted, I found
that about 15 files had gotten "cross-linked" which is a pretty serious
corruption of the hard drive file system.

I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside
its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and
that is what caused the disk problem.

I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained 
by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing 
to do with it.  Has anybody else had this type of problem?

(I only recently "upgraded" from Quick C 2.0 to 2.5.)

Time for a new discussion, maybe ? I asked in these groups some time ago
what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother
who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get
used to it.

Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS
programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just
some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in
Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries
that required that. 
- I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,
  specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never
  felt confortable with it.
- TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the
  ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I
  will try something more complex.
- It works nice even in my "weak" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram. 

But.....

- The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version 
  from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual
  have more itens than in the manual.
- I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother
  as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I 
  suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it
  will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to
  me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...
  who knows.

So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;

- I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is
  there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can 
  contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask
  for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ?
- Is there anybody else using it around here ?
- Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen
  to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself. 

Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

Thanks in advance,

Rafael.

AT the MICRO$OFT display at FOSE, there were a few computers running
windows, and win. apps for the  blind, I think.  Didn't pay much
attention to it, but it was there.

Salutations!
	I don't usually subscribe to these newsgroups so I would really
appreciate it if someone could possibly e-mail me the answer to my problem.
I have been using Windows 3.1 since buying it last winter but I have just
now come across an annoying bug. I now have about 8 different groups in
program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that
makes a new group, it promptly disappears after I turn of windows!
This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v.3. They both created
their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them, they were
gone. I had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a
previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as I turn
off windows.
	my set up:
			precision 386dx-25 w/ 4 megs
			Trident 8900c with 1 meg 
			Windows 3.1 running in 800x600 colour mode
			logitech mouseman
			
Thank you in advance!

Hey folks!

Just moments ago, I uploaded the Bungee Jumper After Dark module that
was widely talked about on here some time ago.

It's at ftp.cica.indiana.edu, in /pub/pc/win3/uploads, titled simply
bungee.zip.

Be sure to set your ftp connection to binary mode before downloading.
If you have any other After Dark shareware/freeware modules, please
upload them too.  The more the merrier.

Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for
Windows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's
MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some
sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:

1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)
                                This was the smallest and simplest
   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.
   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra
   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the
   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press
   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would
   have been nice if there was an "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting for the little
   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified
   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be
   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace
   manager makes it an attractive package.

2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)
                               While this workspace manager offered a
   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming
   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace
   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take "snapshots"
   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what 
   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,
   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.
   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in
   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this
   viewing functionality which is quite useful.

3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)
                            This is an interesting package, which contains
   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies
   include "Backmenu", which provides a pop-up root menu when you
   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu
   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,
   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could
   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also
   bundled in "backdesk.zip" is a program called "WRUN", which allows
   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS
   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  
   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite
   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it
   doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.
   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,
   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to
   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different
   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which
   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window
   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically
   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area
   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up
   of a particular section.

Try each of them out for yourself.  I was impressed with all of them,
so find out which one suits your needs the best.

Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc?  or that it will outsell
them all?  If the first, you have to remember that intel CISC (like the
pentium) are a always a generation away from the best riscs... also Riscs
cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities (not
even on the same order)...  but I remember reading about 3 years (maybe 2)
about a T800(?) from hypercube that did a 100 mips, was superscallar AND
reordered its instruction itself so

Followup-To: comp.os.os2.misc

(NOTE: The followups are set to comp.os.os2.misc.  DMQS files describe
monitors and valid modes to be used by the XGA-2 under both Windows and
OS/2.)

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or
this post.  It's personal this time (and every time I post -- see the
signature).

Due to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I've
collected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision
of the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows
with the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files
will function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I've tried have
worked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not
anything resembling an officially supported set.

As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts:
1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can
   stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in
   shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-).
2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of
   spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor.
3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability
   to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking
   in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play
   around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable
   about what you're doing.
4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files
   you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.
   Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your
warrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don't have that many
monitors.

Installation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually
c:\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation
diskette to change your adapter or settings.

Packing: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.  
You will need PKZip 2.x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities.

Submitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS
files for your favorite monitors.  I'm always interested in collecting more.

Archive:  these files have been uploaded to ftp-os2.nmsu.edu in
pub/uploads/xga2dmqs.zip.

I am looking for a Windows Utility that would give me a listing of files
in a directory, but also display a description of the file.  This utility
would allow me to enter and edit file descriptions of, hopefully, any 
length (maybe a small window with a scroll bar?).  I would then be able
to browse my directories and be able to see what is in a file without
having to open or execute it.  Any such beast out there?  If not, anyone
want to write one?

The model is called WIN-STORM-PC  .
They also have one model the  Legend-24lx

Any info on these like performance and compatibility,
or even problems encountered will be appreciated.

(1) Is it possible to change the icons in the program groups?  I'd like
    to give them some individuality.

(2) Can you set up a short-cut key to return to the Program Manager? 
    I know <CTL><ESC>, <ESC> will do it, but I'd rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the P/M with <ALT><F1>.

Any and all help is welcomed.

	Just got a ss24X based on its good ratings, but am a little
under-impressed.  First, is it's performance in 16.7 mill. supposed
to be comparable to a Trident 8900 (or other unaccelerated VGA)?  I 
came up with only OK performance on WinSpeed.  In 256, it was between
good and great.  Second, does anyone know where to get that JPG viewer
"for the SS24X".  I saw it on cica or something.  Does it work better.

Thanks for any help.

Greg

I use PlugIn, an enhancement to Program Manager. It allows (1) for sure, I
don't know on (2). Anyway, give it a try. I like it a lot and registered it
right away It can be found at ftp.cica.indiana.edu [129.79.20.84] in

I had the exact same failure with the 24X and Word for Windows.
A quick call to Microsoft indicated it was problem with the
24X drivers. You need to call Diamond and get the new drivers,
I think version 2.03 fixes the above problem, there may be later
versions that I'm unaware of...

A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation. Once
the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC.

Unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of SPSS left: when I run
something like "Write" and go to embed an object then "SPSS Chart"
appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all
the obvious "INI" files without success. The next thing I tried
was looking for the string "SPSS Chart" in every file in the 
Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or
REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel
inclined to edit it.

I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.

(1) Did you check that a new *.grp file was actually created in your Windows
    directory?
(2) Are you _turning off_ your computer when windows is running rather than
    closing Program Manager?

I read this in an electronic "magazine" about NT:

"And for all the hoopla about NT, one would
think the thing would be multi-user but it's not. It supports
only one user at a time. It can support multiple clients but
only one actual user."


Your mileage may vary!

  I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and 
  made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most
  evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of
  experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA
  resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.
  
  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It
  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the 
  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed
  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.
  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer
  one.

Hi,
        I was wondering if anyone knew whether or not Logitech had
Windows TWAIN drivers for the Scanman. If so, are the drivers on the
net somewhere? My Scanman is the model one down from the Scanman 256.

        Thanks in advance.

Ok, here's a nice easy question for all you out there.

When running DOS 5.0 under Windows 3.0, I lose the ability to do a
print-screen.
I have no problem with this when I'm running DOS not under Windows.
If it's relavant, I'm using 'Quarterdeck 6.0' expanded memory manager for
my 386.
  Please e-mail any responses, since I don't get to read the news too often.
    Thanks in advance.

I tried to do so, but people told me that even if I used DISPKT, the packets

(From the Windows Resource Toolkit (for Win4Workgroups)), add an entry to
your "system.ini" file under the [NonWindowsApp] section:

    CommandEnvSize=NNNN

"This sets the COMMAND.COM env size, where NNNN must either be 0 or
between 160 and 32768.  A value of 0 disables the setting.  If this
value is too small or too big, it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768.
If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment,
this setting is disabled, as if it were 0.  If you specify the
environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF setting
overrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier
than 3.2.  Otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the
SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS.  To set this value, you must edit your
SYSTEM.INI [and reboot]."


I have used this entry, as well as relied on the default /e: from
the CONFIG.SYS shell= line, and both give larger environments.  If
you don't use one of these, then the environment passed by windows
to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment
_variables_ present when windows was started.  (No matter how big
the DOS env was, when windows starts, it truncates all unused space
except for a few bytes.)  This should allow your batch file to run,
but your mileage may vary.

Help, I'm bored with the current Windows backgrounds we have here and am 
looking for some nifty pictures to use instead.  I've seen from previous posts
that many sites exist that store pictures - available through anonymous ftp.
Except that I can't ftp to remote sites from my machine, what I CAN do is use
'ftpmail' - mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files, 
and/or data back.
Does anyone know of sites, with Windows compatible pictures, that can be 
accessed in such a way??? 
If you do would you please post them.
TIA
   Mark.

PS. Maybe this would make a useful FAQ

I'm not 100% sure, but I think the T800 was a 25MHz transputer?  so ya tie
a gazillion of them together to get 100mips.  (The newest is the T9000
which kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though).

Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced
RISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the
same "performance" as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the
weird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the
Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*).
and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and
make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though
you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).

If you can make a "CISC" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)
with the ideas behind the "RISC" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then
I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC...

If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively
speaking).

Now I may sound like I like intel, but I'll have to say that the P5 is some
real kick butt pile of Si and SiO2...

But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line... or I'm gonna
start crying...

All right.  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give 
your question a shot. 

The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really 
have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need 
10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your 
pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not 
toner.  But that should go without saying.

My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little 
while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once 
the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out 
every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  

The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or 
HP wouldn't sell many......

Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built 
like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.

Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like 
a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not 
as impressive.  

So, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?

I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card. 
The driver I am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more 
than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory. 

The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable! They are still using 2400bps 
modem! It will take you hours to download the drivers, it hurts when you
are calling long distance. Is there any ftp site that has a collection
of video drivers for windows?

BTW, anyone using this card, and how do you like it so far?

Thanks.

My Problem: I wasn't aware of the fact that I would need an *SCSI*-CD-ROM for
Windows NT when ordering the Beta-SDK-Package. So my question: Is there any driver
available that will allow me to use my Mitsumi (Non-SCSI) CD-ROM for installation ?
If there is one, from which place (ftp-site) can I get it ?

Many thanks in advance

I have the same card, TVGA-8900c. When I checked, the latest driver for
windows 3.1 is dated Aug. 92 in garbo.uwasa.fi in /win31/drivers/video.
If you find a better version (updated) please let me know, Thanks.

Hello,

I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/sounds directory.  It's called
drum.zip.  

I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed. 
When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is not
installed, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it
is installed.  

Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program
will work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a
metronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are
circulating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Terry

Open up the .PIF file with the PIF Editor, click on the "Advanced" button,
and then reserve the PrtSc key for the application.  Any keys that you
select in this section will be passed along to the application rather than

Hi, 

I have a simple question. Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME
window without a title bar; ie

	(WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME) & ~WS_CAPTION 


I don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar.

I have another question:

I have a overlapped window(say V) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc)
The window shows up with all it's children fine. Now, I create another 
child(t) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of
it's siblings. Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it. How do
I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings.
I used SetWindowPos() and BringWindowToTop() without success. What's happening
is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go, it goes
behild it's siblings.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Manu

Has anyone had any experience with a replacement comm driver for windows
called TurboComm.  I read about it in PCMag Apr 23 1993 and am interested
but not willing to shell out the 45 bucks the company wants just to try it
out.  It supposedly eleminates the problems that occur during a high speed
file transfer and a disk access made by another program running at the same
time.  If anyone has any pro/cons about this product, i would be very inter
ested to hear them.  Please Email at the address give below.  THANKS.

No, not really. It may be that your winfile.ini has gotten corrupted for
some unknown reason. Have you tried re-creating it by either
1.exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar
is visible,
or
2.double clicking on the Control menu(the one with minimize and maximize
in in) when everything looks proper?

If you have, and it still doesn't work, you may want to delete your
winfile.ini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally
recreate the file from scratch.

Good luck!

 I think you can do this with REGEDIT, which can make changes
to the OLE registration database.  From Program Manager (or 
File Manager) choose RUN and type REGEDIT.  You do have it-
its included with Windows, but not well documented.

Hello WinNetters:

I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of 
MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there 
with experience with the database package called "Approach".  It has gotten
a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it
would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access
because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a
field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it
seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz,
6 MB ram).

So, please provide me with your thoughts are "Approach", good and bad.  Thanks.

I had this problem when I first loaded windows.  My I/O card is for 2 HD's
2 FD's 1 Parrelel 2 serial (1 for mouse and 1 for my external modem) and
a game port.  PROBLEM enters.  The DARN serial ports have no selection for 
COM settings, they are stuck on 3 and 4.  
Good card for HD's and FD's but lousy for serial. 

I called Microsoft and other places.  The long and short of it is
WINDOWS wants com1 and 2 ONLY!, for mouse selection.
I went out and bought a small I/O card just for parrelel and serial.
Now I have ALL 4 active COM ports and LPT1 and LPT2.
This Half card was less than $20.

Mouse on COM 1  external modem on COM 2,  I disabled the LPT2 so I could use
the interupt for my scanner card IRQ.

    I just moved from Borland C++ 3.0 to Visual C++ today. When I tried
to compile my C++ program, it complained a function prototype problem.
It turned out that the typedef WORD in MS C++ is a BYTE, not unsigned int.

    Could anyone shine some light on this subject ? Why a WORD is a BYTE ?

There are 3 alternatives:
1. You can try to write a small C program something like:

   int my_int_var;
   my_int_var = system("command");

   and display my_int_var value (which is the exit code of the command).

2. Or use 4dos.com instead of command.com (it has built in move command)
   you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function
   of 4dos:

   c:\>echo %@exec[command]

   will display the exit code of the command.

3. Get DOS 6, not worth buying if you already have QEMM/PCTools/Norton,
   and you only need the move utility.

Sounds like the original poster of the bitmap uuencoded the file

uudecode program balked at the carraige-returns.

The window is probobly on top but the lower windows are drawing over it.
Try using WS_CLIPSIBLING to keep the lower siblings from drawing on the
top sibling's space.

This isn't entirely true. It is true that TrueType fonts are
larger than their ATM counterparts, but ATM fonts *do* get minimal
compression. Running Stacker 3.0 report generator, I get:

	 File Type:      Compression Ratio:
	 -------------   ------------------
	 *.TTF (TrueType)     1.4:1.0
	 *.PFB (ATM)          1.1:1.0
	 *.PFM (ATM Metric)  11.8:1.0

Although the metric files are small, they compress quite largely.
And, as you can see, even the regular .PFB files have *some* compression.

So, doing the math on one such comparitive font file:

TTF Times = 83260 bytes/1.4 = 59471 bytes (compressed)
PFB Times = 51549 bytes/1.1 = 46862 bytes (Compressed)

You still win out, even if the ATM Times font *isn't* compressed.

Your mileage may vary depending on compression program.

ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB.
I was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows.
but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA,
especially this new Strike Commander. ;-)
this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench).
my winmark was 6.35 million, i think.

so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully
can perform approx same w/ my current VRAM in windows and also
can perform DOS' VGA preferably >30fps.

i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it
in csipg and it looked that SpeedStar 24X and Orchid Prodesigner 2d-s
ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard.
both can give >30fps in DOS' VGA w/ 486dx2/66.
Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor
type ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)?
any other card recommendation is welcomed too.

also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-)

thanks in advance, folks!

Stacker achieves better compression ratio than DOS6, yet the
latter comes with virus detection, memory manager, and multiple
booting. Each of them are not so good as the NAV, QEMM or NDOS
in my opinion, but with a package of only $45, it's nice if
haven't yet installed all of those stuffs.

Both certainly work with Win31.

You do mean disks, don't you, not tapes?  You forgot to say whether you

Well, my newsreader shows the UUE file as having lots of spaces, which

Is anyone out there running a MS-DOS system with a LocalTalk board? I am on an
Appletalk network, hooked up with a DayStar Digital LT200 MC LocalTalk
Interface Board, running on a PS/2 Model 70. I'm using the AppleShare PC
software for file server and network access. It works fine under DOS or the
Window or OS/2 DOS box. But when I try to load it *before* Windows, so that
every application I run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as
soon as I start up an application. And of course, things look pretty hopeless
for OS/2 (but who knows). 

So, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup?

Message-ID: <1rg3m9INN5tc@swan.doc.ic.ac.uk>

A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning
communicating
between VB and MSACCESS using DDE. The answers I received at
that time
allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However,
during
this process I have come up with new problems.

1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic
string. Is
this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS
or VB?

2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the
DDE SQL command,
(provided the above limitation is overcome by using short
field and table
names) but how is one meant to update a database?
   a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.
   b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command
from VB cannot
      be used because when the macro requests information from
VB using a
      second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time-
outs occur.
      (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access
to VB channel
      is initiated, I guess.)
   c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.


   The way I eventually managed to update a database was by
sending key-
   strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This
technique has
   the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must
always be in a
   state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB
sends.

Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect
assumptions?
Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any
signs of an
ODBC driver for Access?

Summary: after editing win.ini [embedding..], and leaving only 1 entry

Hey all...I got an equation editor, and since it didn't automagically
appear in my "object" dialog box (i.e. insert-->object-->equation), I
decided to manually place it there.  So I went into win.ini (is there
another way to do this?), the [embedding] section, and added 

equation=equation,equation,<path\filename>,picture.

didn't work.
quit windows, go back.  AHA: mistake. Correct it.  It looks fine.
start windows...doesn't work.  play with it for a while, at one point
having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally I
get it to work.  The only thing I can see that's different now is that
it's now the first item on the list, and it used to be the last.  But
now I end up with *three* "equation" entried, and *all* of them working.
(and only one entry in win.ini).

so does any netian know what's wrong? or rather, how to correct this?
(i.e. make "equation"appear but once?).

Also, all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above.
It's obvious that <path\filename> is the executable, or whatever, and
"picture" has something to do withthe way it appears
(picture/description?)

but what are the others?
i.e., in

soundrec=sound,sound,
whate's the difference between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd?  
and what is "soundrec"?? (I don't think it's the name of the executable,
as other entries (e.g. MSWorksChart=...) aren't)

thanks, i.a.

good), and I got a problem with it...
There is an option there, "realize colour table", and if it's
switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with
some screensavers (e.g. the "flashlight" one).  If I turn it off,
however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off.  All's
nice and well.  However, If I turn it off, then it will be on
again next time I start windows.  All the setting are set in the
win.ini file, and I *do* have "save settings on exit" selected.

also, I tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file
to "n" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows.  It
will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again*
turn the option on.

I tried adding a +R (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and
it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then.
Actually, it's the same application.  Anywya, it didn't work,
since it must change the setting at the win.ini file.

so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me?

thanks, i.a.

Do you mean the icons _of_ the program groups, or the icons of the
individual programs _in_ the program groups?  I assume you mean the
latter, and the answer is: sure you can.  Just click once (not double)
on the application icon, then Alt-F P (File | Properties).  Click on the
Change Icon box and tell it the icon filename.  Or use the Browse
sub-selection.

I use Alt-Tab.  Hold the Alt key and repeatedly press Tab until you see
Program Mangler up.  Then release the Alt key.

Word for Windows lets me designate text as being in a language other
than US English.  (Alt-F L, Format | Language, as I recall.)  So I mark
it for English (UK), but it still accepts "rumor" and squawks at
"rumour".  As far as I can see, Microsoft didn't include the English
(UK) dictionary on my disks.  (I don't mean to imply that I was singled
out; I assume that nobody in the U.S got them.)  I dialed the Microsoft
BBS, but nothing in the Word for Windows section looked helpful.

Can anyone tell me where or how to obtain the UK spelling dictionary for
Winword 2.0?  The file name would be SPELL_UK.LEX or something similar.

Email please; I'll post a summary.

I think I have the same problem. I think it is caused by the rubber ball
in the mouse, which doesn't roll so smooth. The detectors in the mouse
notice this and whoops, I hit a mine (using minesweeper :-) ).

I think the solution will be buying a new mouse, and/or using a mouse pad.

You're using drivers version 2.02 or earlier. The latest is 2.03, available
from their BBS or by snailmail. It at least fixes the WfW problem.

The reason I wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because
of following: I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told
that I can expect a new version near the end of the month. Which should be
about now...

However, I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standard
mode. Apparently they don't know of this problem and seem to be surprised
why anybody would want to use standard mode at all.


It's a great card for the price, at least when I bought it. Now there may be
better alternatives.

It is correct that VC++ is NOT considered an upgrade for C7. C7 is
basically a DOS product, VC++ is a Windows product. As Windows is not
an upgrade for DOS, it is a separate operating system product line, its
utilities cannot be upgrades for DOS utilities. However, I have also
been told that it is NOT an upgrade for QCWIN, which it should be!

I know this is probably a FAQ, but...

I installed the s/w for my ATI graphics card, and it bashed my Windows
logo files.  When I start Windows now, it has the 3.0 logo instead of
the 3.1 logo.

I thought the files that controlled this were

\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.RLE
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.LGO	

I restored these files, but it didn't change the logo.  Anyone know what
the correct files are?

Thanks.

Another alternative is to clean the mouse you've got.  Sometimes the
rollers inside the mouse pick up a ball of lint or other debris.  Open the
bottom of the mouse, take out the ball and use some alcohol on a Q-tip to
clean it out.  Inspect the inside for any hairs or fuzz.  I have had my
mouse get real jumpy and cleared up the problem with this procedure.

Internal DOS commands (certainly 3.3 and before) do not set the exit
code. This is a royal pain if you want to do anything which checks for
successful deletions etc. The best suggestion is to use 4dos which
does return you exit codes. It also has move command,

I installed Windows for Workgroups on my network and I'm having problems 
mapping drives in the file-manager.

Situation:
If I put LASTDRIVE = Z in my config.sys, NETX will run but I can't access
drive f: to log in to Novell.  
If I don't put LASTDRIVE = Z in my config.sys I can't access other W4WG 
drives from the file-manager.

It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE = 
statement in my Config.Sys.

I would appreciate any help.  It's probably an easy problem that all you 
Windows guru's solved many many moons ago...

Thanks,

Hi, I am using a dtk 386-20Mhz 13Meg memory to run a variety of
programs, and have had problems off and on with lock up,
but now I am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memory
over a period of time (Playmation 24 bit rendered) and it is 
locking up Everytime.  I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I have
tried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region of
video memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386,
have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to
prevent swapping) and I have REM'd ALL TSR's and utilities in config.syus
and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling
my HP dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv,
no TSR's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still
locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except
3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows
screen, but simply does a full reset immediately).  Just about out
of ideas, anyone out there have any????  Thanks

This should be in the FAQ, it only get asked about twenty times a month

There is *NO*, that's right, *NO* telnet access to Compuserve, no ftp access,
no gopher access....no Internet services except e-mail.

You can telnet to hermes.merit.edu, but that routes you through Sprintnet,
which is horrendously expensive.

For a VGA card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them
back and expect it to work.  You have to create a new WIN.COM file.  Try
the command (you will have to worry about what directories each file is in
since I don't know your setup):

COPY /B WIN.CNF+VGALOGO.LGO+VGALOGO.RLE WIN.COM

(I grabbed this from _Supercharging Windows_ by Judd Robbins--great book)
This is also how you can put your own logo into the Windows startup screen.
An RLE file is just a specially compressed BMP file.

Hope this helps

Try setting up another HPIII printer but when choosing what port to connect it
to choose FILE instead of like :LPT1.  This will prompt you for a file name
everytime you print with that "HPIII on FILE" printer. Good Luck.

Ummm.. I think you left the message out...

I get these protection faults all the time on my machine at work, a
486 33MHz with 4MB RAM, Windows 3.1, with Dos 5.0.  

At home (on a 386 40MHz, 8MB RAM, Windows 3.1 and Dos 5.0) I *never* get
these.  

Any idea what could be wrong?  Someone already suggested I check for tmp
files in the windows/temp directory, there are none there.

The message I get is:

	This application has violated system integrity due to an invalid
	general protection fault and will be terminated.

I only have this problem with applications running in DOS boxes (with or
without .pif files setup for them).

Any hints/help greatly appreciated.  Please post since at least one other
person is also having gpf problems.

Thanks,
    Gordon

Somewhere (ftp.cica.indiana.edu or SIMTEL20 mirror) there is a program  
called winlogo.zip that does the trick. It works great. I believe the  
reason why you can't change the files you mentioned is that the logo is  
actually imbeded into the windows executable (Somebody please  
correct/expand on this)

Whenever I exit Windows, I can't use control-alt DEL to reboot my  
computer, because the system hangs when I do this. I can still reboot  
using the reset key, but I would like to know why this happens..

I am not sure whether I am here in the right area, but does 
anybody here know whether Windows NT does/will include a X 
Windows server so that it can run X Window applications 
remotely? This is because we are considering at our university 
to use PC's for word processing and program development, 
whereas the bigger jobs are to be run either on SUN 
workstations or on Fujitsu super computers.
 
Thank you very much in advance,

WINDOWS NT


I need some information on the new Windows NT.
Anything you have would be appreciated. I know nothing about it.
(Well, except that it exists.)
Some questions... 

Memory requirements, hard drive space, release date? is it out?
How is IBM reacting? Intel?
Can it replace other LAN OS's?

ANYTHING else like specs, speed, etc..

Thanks in advance!

OK...I've heard rumors about this...I might have even seen it in a few places.
And I'd like some info...Is it possible to embed fonts in a document (Like 
Write, Word, or Ami Pro?) so the file can be printed on another machine that
doesn't have the font?  If possible, how is it done?

I'm sorry if this is a faq...I couldn't find a faq list...I would also 
apreciate knowing where that is...if a windows faq exsists.

Thanks in advance

Lines: 38

I have been experiencing several end-user problems with various commercial
software packages (WordPerfect 5.2/WIN, Publish It!/WIN 3.1) and printing
landscape mode on a Citizen PN48 (the little guy) or the Citizen GSX-140+.

In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches of
information from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType font
output, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the
first.

WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the "Default" location
for the printers instead of "Tractor" or "Manual".  They have also filed
this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it.

MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving that
Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't!  Are you surprised?  I'm
not.

Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider-
my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely*
they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround.

WORKAROUND
----------
Go into the Windows 3.1 control panel, select printers, select your Citizen
printer driver, select SETUP, and select a custom size of 850 x 1132.  Like
magic, all of your problems will go away.

Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies!

Hello,

I thought this problem might have something to do with Windows 3.1 SMARTDRV and
a VESA video card...any ideas???

I recently purchased a 486DX-33 machine and am having problems where the 
machine will suddenly freeze or reboot.  This may happen in Windows 3.1 or DOS 
5.0.  Sometimes it is after printing a document, sometimes after using the 
mouse, and sometimes just when I am sitting there.  Twice when it happened, the 
machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps.  I looked in the documentation and 
the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts.  The machine has the 
following configuration and files:

486DX-33
AMI BIOS
5.25 and 3.5 floppies
170 Meg IDE hard drive
256k cache
Microsoft compatible mouse on com1
Citizen GSX-145 on lpt1
NI SuperVGA Monitor with VESA Windows Accelerator Card w/ 1Meg
Two VESA slots
Windows 3.1
DOS 5.0

CONFIG.SYS
==========
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
DOS=HIGH
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
FILES=20
BUFFERS=20
STACKS=9,128

AUTOEXEC.BAT
============
@ECHO OFF
LH C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 1024
PROMPT $p$g
PATH C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;C:\MOUSE
LH C:\MOUSE\MOUSE
SET TEMP=C:\DOS
LH C:\DOS\DOSKEY 


When the machine freezes, I can't use the mouse or keyboard or use Ctrl-Alt-Del 
to reboot.  If any one can give me any help, I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency (memory wise) I 
would appreciate that also.

Try  telnet 128.196.128.234, login TO_CSERVE

This will get you into the CompuServe network. Enter hostname CIS and you'll get

Hi, anyone have the latest drivers for the Actix Graphics Accelerator Card? 
(32 plus) The one I have (version 1.21) seem to have a lot of problems. 
I believe the latest version is 1.3 and would someone please 
upload it to some ftp site so that I can download it. 

Thanks

And/or taking the rubber ball out of the mouse (should be directions
in the manual or on the bottom of the mouse) and cleaning it with
alcohol (isopropyl, I believe - the same alcohol as used for cleaning
your cassette deck).  This is good to do every so often, even if you
have a mouse pad.  Dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the
rubber ball.  As well, lint and other garbage may find it's way onto
the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and
vertical sensors.

Hope this helps.  Good luck.

Well...I need the old 8" disks ... You are right, disks is a better word,
but they are so big and calling them disks is kind of funny ... but the

First off, I haven't used W4WG (but I think that's about to change!).

The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general (and
in this case NETX in particular) adds drives to the device chain. 
Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no "unassigned" (as opposed to
"unused") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive
mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives.  W4WG obviously
attaches its network drives to "existing, unused" drive letters.

I'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVE=M, which on
most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still
allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well.

I am ordering the Actix graphicsengine ultra plus. It is the same price
as the stealth card. Plus it is also based on S3 928 chip the newest and
fastest chip from s3. 
Everyone, if you are looking for a card, SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE
FOR THEIR REVIEW.  
They noted this person's problem with dos. The stealth card is not a very good
dos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local
bus). It got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and I called
them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! They have
a bulletin board to get the latest drivers. 
Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400. 

AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards
in the 928 class (based on the winmark results).

If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out
the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.

P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie:
games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently
scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip
(ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have "comparable" windows performance and
are cheaper to buy.

I was at the Trenton Computer Fest and there were many sources of
ink refills for the HP and Canon, so if you don't like the ink you're using,
you have a choice.  There is a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) list
that's reposted occasionally that reports how to refill the cartridges
yourself with inks that are available from the stationery store
instead of a "specialty" ink with the specialty price.

I'm not sure, but I think I found another legal source of cheap
hypos for injecting ink into the cartridges.
More on that when my mail order succeeds.

To clarify:  

VC++ *is* considered an upgrade for C7.  There will be no product
called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its
version as 8.00).  C7 is not a "DOS"-only product -- it is a C/C++
compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is
VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with
many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in
creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by
automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial
impressions have been very favorable.

Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a
considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7. If you
haven't, call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some!

Gee, I remember the old 8" FLOPPY disks we used on an S-100 CP/M system
back in high school.  Not to mention those old 24" multi-platter disk 
packs that held about 15MB that went in the big washing machine
drives at the local college I took some programming classes at.
And this was even in the early '80's....

I have a modest system of aliases/macros that enables me to download
mail from a public access UNIX system to my MS-DOS box. I read and reply
to the mail with a MS Windows 3.1 based editor.

Everything works peachey keen as long as the author of the message has
maintained his text at 80 col. max. width. Sometimes I get slightly wider
messages that run off-screen, so I have to use the cursor/slider to read
the whole thing.

I'm using NDW Deskedit mainly, but I've experienced the same prob with
all other MS WIndows editors. I've fiddled with word wrap settings in
the various editors, but to no avail. I know I'm missing something very
basic in editor setup, but what is it?

Oh yeah, MS Word for Windows converts everything flawlessly but for what
I'm looking for that's like using a tank to crack walnuts.

I'd really like to have an editor setup that would display all incoming
ASCII files in a readable format to my screen.

Thanks in advance,

Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1)
compress?  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than
PC-Cache running, so that is not it.  The first time I try to run Ami
Pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a) 
segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all times
after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when
it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module
AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147.  I have not been able to fix this problem except
by reinstalling Ami Pro.  This has happened twice, with both times being
after having ran compress on my hard drive.  BTW, I am not running stacker
or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know,
PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.  My system is
a 386-40MHz, with 16MB of RAM and a NEC (OEM) hard drive, etc, but that
shouldn't make a difference.

PLEASE email me as I can't keep up with the newsgroup, and it will cut down
on net traffic anyways.  Thanks.

W4WG requires DOS drives.  I use LASTDRIVE=J which makes my first Novell drive
K and leaves me drives G, H, I and J for W4WG.  My local DOS drives use A-F.

Recently the following problem has arrisen.  The first time I turn on my  
computer when windows starts (from my autoexec) after the win31 title screen  
the computer reboots on its own.  Usually the second time (after reboot) or  
from the DOS prompt everything works fine.

 s far as I remember I have not changed my config.sys or autoxec.bat or  
win.ini.  I can't remember whether this problem occured before I  
optimized/defragmented my disk and created a larger swap file (Thank you  
MathCAD 4 :(  )

Well, I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. I received 20
responses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it
possible.

On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase
and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application
that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL
string and receive the results.

Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other 
products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,
RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.

For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C
portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the
source code, and portability is important in my application. It works
with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.

However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.
It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and
formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,
except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:
the "ODBC Programmer's Reference" and the "ODBC SDK Guide". Moreover,
ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's 
up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,
it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). 
Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should
make life interesting in the future.

Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by 
a line of asterisks (*).

****************************************************************************

Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want. 
The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox
4.0.  (Why the versions are different, I don't know. PD Engine 2.0 was
compatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5...).  It consists of a rather broad
library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I think
turbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).

Now.. reading the box... it's "Borland Paradox Engine & Database
Frameworks".  Works with any Borland C/C++, Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later,
Turbo C++ for Windows, Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later, TP for Windows 1.0 or
later.  For Framework applications, BC++ 3.0 or later or MS C/C++ 7.0. It
does have support for object useage...

I haven't had a real chance to really use it myself... but it looks fairly
complete... I'm planning to use it this summer.

the Paradox for Windows was impemented on top of it.

  MS has put their ODBC SDK into the public domain; it's
 _big_ (I believe 1.8 MB), but worth downloading over a
 fast link. Look at ftp.uu.net in vendor/microsoft/odbc-sdk.

 Also some companies are starting to provide SQL engines; I
 just got one for RBASE, not exactly cheap at $450, but it
 allows programs in C or VBASIC (under DOS or Windows) to talk
 to data bases using SQL functions in your code.

Borland sells the Paradox Engine -- which has all the Paradox calls in it.
Its hardly SQL though.  You can do searches on key fields and on 
indivual fields, but no comparison operators like <, >=....

so its pretty painful (in my opinion) do do anything besides simple
retrieval and inserts/updates.

I'm currently using it (I have an eval copy..) and I've linked it in to
some entry screens I've written.

The Engine library adds about 100K to the size of the program, but you can
load it as an overlay using Borland's VROOM manager.

Now Borland claims that later versions of the engine will have SQL support
but they don't really expect it till late in the year... or even next year
They are trying to get thrid parties to help out..

If you have any other questions -- let me know...

****************************************************************************

Yes, borland sells their Paradox Engine separately.  It has C, C++, and
Pascal interfaces, although the underlying interface is in 'C'. Well at
least for version 2.0 of the Engine which I have (costed $99 at Egghead).
They now have version 3.0 of the engine, and a separate C++ class package
for it.

I've used AccSys for Paradox (new version is almost ready for Paradox
4.0) to access Paradox files from C.  Its pretty good.  Not SQL
though.  Have heard of Borland Paradox Engine or some such which is
supposed to do likewise, but not sure of what it is exactly.

Hope this helps, good luck!

Borland sells their "Paradox Engine (3.0)".  It's a library of functions
for accessing paradox DB files.  It comes with libraries for:
MS C 7.0
BCC 3.1
Turbo Pascal (v??)
and I believe it comes with Turbo Pascal/Win libraries as well.
The C libraries come in both DOS and Windows flavors (the win stuff 
being dll's).  

When I got it, it also came with Crystal Reports which
is a graphical report generator.  It allows you to create a generic
form and use it within a compiled program using Pdox Engine.  I don't
know if they still offer it or what the current price is, I paid 
something like $50-$60 for an upgrade from the earlier version though...

Hope this helps...

have their address oops -- yes I do!    :

Ask for the SQL/Win demo disk.

It looked good to me (I have a background in embedded SQL in Ingres -- this
looked real similar). It's a little expensive, but if you order the demo
and then just wait they will probably send you a special offer that'll
probably run about $500 US. Good luck!

Borland has the Paradox Engine library.  It has libraries for
both C and Pascal to access Paradox files under DOS/Windows.  
But for Paradox, I believe you'd have buy have the SQL Link 
since Pdox itself isn't SQL compliant.  I've used the engine 
for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it.  
Under DOS, it's a real pig.  It tacks on about 120K to the size of 
your programs.

I don't know about Microsoft, but Borland sells the Paradox Engine for C/C++ &
Pascal (in one package).  And if you want dBase compatible files there is a 
library called CodeBase from Sequiter software that works with C/C++.

We're using Q+E database libraries to do what you describe.
It's a set of DLL's accessed through a common API to talk to most of the
major database formats. We're using it to build an application that
queries several databases using SQL queries. _All_ access using Q+E is
done using SQL. The package is available through Microway in Melbourne. I
believe it is produced by Pioneer Systems in the US. We have no
association with Microway or Pioneer Systems other than being satisfied
customers.  Feel free to mail me for further information.

Paradox Engine 3.0 provides a complete set of C libraries for 
accessing Paradox tables. However, it seems that it supports 
only Borland/Turbo C and MicroSoft C. When I tried to compile 
the engine's sample applications with the Waterloo WATCOM C/C++
(32-bit) compiler, it complains that the library file LLIBCE.LIB 
is missing even though I am quite certain that the file is NOT
part of WATCOM C or the engine. Anybody have any success with 
other C compilers?

I'm currently developing an app. with Borland's "Paradox Engine
for C" (it also comes in Pascal), which has recently gone to version 3.0
(I.e., PX Engine 3.0 is compatible with Paradox 4.0, and downward compat.
w/3.5).  There are indeed C libs for Fox access, but I can't think of the
names offhand - I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard -
(I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the "C Users Journal", which
is a good place to look for this type of package in general, by the way).
I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX Eng. over the
past year - wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser app.--but I'm
staying with it for now--it's like a bad marriage: I've got too much time
invested in learning and work-arounds!  But if your interest is limited
to a simple single-user interface (you want to build your own SQL engine,
I take it), PX Engine will do the job easily - it doesn't sound like
you'll be bumping into any of the gotchas.  If you do, write me; I may
be able to point you in the right direction.

You might try the recorder and make a micro.  I done that to do certain operations 
in a windows app that didn't have the ability to use a micro.  It should be in the 
Accessories window.  The only problem is that it has to be runing for it to work.
But, Good Luck.

If you want to get them and get them now (also the most up to date) use
the BBS at 1-408-439-9096.  They may take an hour to download so do it
when rates are low.  Yeah, I know it costs but locking up your system
gets old quick.  Maybe someone has them on the net.  I've got the
Stealth drivers.

Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse
jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse. (Sorry, I didn't say the solution
was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse.
(Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write
cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke
down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better
than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy
all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so
used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a
month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!

I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems
one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you
don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes
a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.

Hope this helps someone else. If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I
was, it's well worth the $80.

Hello all:

I was wondering, is the "Kermit" package (the actual package, not a
different program with Kermit file transfers) available for Microsoft
Windows 3.0/3.1?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  Please e-mail or post.

Thanks in advance!

Surely some one of you is familiar with what a mail-order company goes
through. This company has only a few products, but thousands of clients.
I need a Sales, Billing, and Receivables program to handle the thing,
but I need to be able to customize it myself, own the source, etc. Anyone
willing to sell me the basic stuff (in ANY development language) I'll
be willing to pay about $1,000 to. 

It has to be ready now. I need this sort of solution immediately. With more
time I'll just develop one myself. If you can have me a prototype in
two weeks, you can make some quick cash.

Sorry about that - don't want to alarm anyone...

I don't think there is any correlation between the crashes and PCTools.
I reinstalled Ami Pro, and ran compress again, with no problems.
I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had
0 bytes (!) left while FTPing, although I would think it wouldn't
matter since Ami Pro wasn't running at the time, and I made space available
immediately anyways.
But, whatever, the cause, it is working now.

backdesk.zip is on CICA, but I'm not sure of the whole directory.

Another to throw into the running is topdesk.  It is alsow on CICA, but
I'm not sure where.  It is more complicated then backdesk, but I've found
it to be more stable and more usefull.  I recomend it to people who
have already used a virtual desktop.  Oh yeh, It's free.

I am running Windows 3.1, Windows for Work Groups and just loaded Dos 6.

What`s happening appears as a graphics problem with File Manager.  I've
added some menubar buttons but there appears to be a gray boxed region
that covers the top 2/3'rds of the button row.  

These buttons are in a row below the pulldown menus.  the pulldown menus
look fine, and the disk label region looks fine, but you only see the bottom
few pixels of the task buttons.

Anyone else experience this?

Thanks.

Howdy

We have been having a real problem with an AST 386sx/16 machine with
4mb of RAM.  We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think 
Paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok
(windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell
network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program
will not load in 386 enchanted mode.  The thermometer bar goes to 60%
and we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygram
talking about an illegal instruction.  I've checked out the command.com
thing, but as a long-time C programmer, I've crashed my share of machines
with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)

Anyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  We also have
quattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  Spent about 2 hours
with Borland's tech people, with no avail.  The guy I talked to a microsoft
didn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly.
Somewhat disappointing, really.  I expected more from Microsoft.  You'd think
with all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all
the possible problems, but I guess not...

Microsoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing UAE and General
Protection faults (sorry, I can't fax anything out of here so please
don't ask, try Microsoft), which we tried.  We did *everything* they
said, and still no luck.

So.  If you can help, please mail me.  This problem is driving us nuts.
I will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on.

Thanks

Kelly

Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see
(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully
scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*
You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.
Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  

I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom
is that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along.  If this
doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly
recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,
place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep
the dust off.

Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice
that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains
or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.

Might the problem not be with the video monitor instead?  Many of our
monitors, as they age, develop shadows on white and bright colors.

Hi all,

I have a DLL in which I Register a class and create a window of that
class type.  Both calls require a module instance handle, hInstance.

Petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instance
handle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of the
DLL (page 934).

I have two questions:

1)  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module?

2)  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of
    the DLL?

Thanks in advance,
Mike

Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts.

This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors.
The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background.
The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image
quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.

For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here
is how to put it back together.
	1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files
	2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer
	   in each file.
	3. concatinate all the parts into a single file
	4. uudecode the file
There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as
uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post
these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know.

I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 Video card
and received the wrong drivers.  Does anyone know where
I can ftp the windows video drivers for the Stealth 24.
I tried the drivers at cica and they don't work.
The right drivers are on the Diamond BBS but the file is almost
1 meg and it would take a while to download them
at 2400 baud.  Any information would be appreciated.  Please
contact me at doug@sun.sws.uiuc.edu

 You can edit that file with a utility that comes with Windows 3.1 called
"REGEDIT" (Registration Info Editor)

DOS 5.0/6.0 cannot read the NTFS file system, although the NTFS file system
can read the FAT file system of DOS.  I have WindowsNT on a seperate
partition on my machine at home, and I can read my DOS disks from Windows NT,
but not vice-versa.

As far as the robustness of the file system, it seems to be very fast, and
I have yet to have a single problem with it.  That doesn't prove it's better
than the FAT system though.  Read the book 'Inside Windows NT,' it will give
you all the info you're looking for.

I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back.  I 
felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor.
The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard 
complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control 
problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.

There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not 
match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the 
frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that 
the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter 
and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable 
pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness 
when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the 
controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the 
raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome 
as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.

I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold 
through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that 
way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has 
my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if 
it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to 
buy.

I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models 
straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of 
all models.

This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an "OS").  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, "Chicago", debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV.

I am starting to work on a project using DDE to transfer data.  The 
application came with an Excel macro which can transfer the data.
I need to 'port' it to 1-2-3W.  1-2-3W uses a very different setup
for DDE macros.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to good references?  I have 
downloaded "WW01117:  Windows Dynamic Exchange (DDE)" [the MS
Application Note].  Any books worth getting?

The specifics are:

Server application:  Dionex AI-450 Chromatography Data System
Client application:  1-2-3 for Windows V1.1

Except for the macro, Dionex did not provide any documentation
for DDE.  Also, I am having problems because I am trying to develop
the application on my PC, but to actually get data, you need to be
connect to the instrument.  Any help here would be appreciated, too.

Thanks,

Does anyone know a program that will record keyboard sequences that I 
do in a windowed dos box? I would like to have something that starts a
telnet program and then logs me into my accounts. Windows Recorder doesn't
seem to be able to record the key sequences.

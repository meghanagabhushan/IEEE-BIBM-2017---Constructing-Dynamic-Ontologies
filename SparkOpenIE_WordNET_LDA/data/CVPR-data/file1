 '''Abraham Lincoln''' (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|16th]] [[President of the United States]], serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. He successfully led his country through its greatest internal crisis, the [[American Civil War]], preserving the Union and [[abolutionism|ending]] slavery. Before his election in 1860 as the first [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] president, Lincoln had been a [[country lawyer]], an [[Illinois]] [[Illinois House of Representatives|state legislator]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and twice an unsuccessful candidate for election to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of [[slavery in the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Holzer|2004|p=232}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination in 1860 and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president]] later that year. His tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] [[Confederate States of America]] in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the [[abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery]], issuing his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 and promoting the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution. As the civil war was drawing to a close, Lincoln became the first American president to be [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassinated]]; it would be another month before the surrender of the remaining Confederate forces and [[Jefferson Davis]]' capture.
 Lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], a war scare with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], in 1861. Under his leadership, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].
 [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and other opponents of the war criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the [[Radical Republicans]], an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these road blocks, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his [[Gettysburg Address]] is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. Abraham Lincoln has consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest U.S. Presidents]].&lt;ref name=Scholar_surveys&gt;Note especially Lincoln's ranking in the [[Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents#Scholar_survey_results|Scholar survey results]] section.&lt;/ref&gt;
 ==Personal life==
 ===Childhood and education===
 [[Image:HinghamSign.jpeg|thumb|left|Samuel Lincoln, first American ancestor of Abraham, worshipped at Old Ship Church, Hingham, Massachusetts]]
 Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks]], two uneducated farmers, in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the {{convert|348|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast [[Hardin County, Kentucky]] (now part of [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]), making him the first president born west of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]].
 &lt;!-- except for Fillmore, who was born in Summerhill, NY - on the west side of the Appalachian-Alleghany-Adirondack ridge--&gt; 
 Lincoln was not given a middle name. Lincoln's ancestor [[Samuel Lincoln]] had arrived in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] from [[Hingham, Norfolk|England]] in the 17th century. His grandfather, also named Abraham Lincoln, had moved to Kentucky, where he owned {{convert|5500|acres|0|abbr=on}}, and was killed in an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] raid in 1786.&lt;ref&gt; Marion Dexter Learned, ''Abraham Lincoln, an American migration'' (1909) [http://books.google.com/books?id=cRUfAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:lincoln+intitle:american+intitle:migration&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=0 full text online]&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[Image:Abe-Lincoln-Birthplace-2.jpg|thumb|left|Symbolic log cabin at the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park]]]]
 For some time, Thomas Lincoln, had been a respected citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|200|1808}}}} today){{inflation-fn|US}} and assumption of a debt. The family belonged to a [[Primitive Baptist|Hardshell Baptist]] church, although Abraham himself never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.
 In 1816 the Lincoln family became impoverished, losing their land through court action, and was forced to make a new start in [[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]], Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;
 It is now in [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]), Indiana. &lt;/ref&gt; 
 Lincoln later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery,&quot; and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt; 
 Unlike land in the [[Northwest Territory]], Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property in lawsuits such as the one Thomas Lincoln lost.
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 When Lincoln was nine, his mother, then 34 years old, died of [[milk sickness]]. Soon afterwards, his father remarried to [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]]. Lincoln and his stepmother were close; he called her &quot;Mother&quot; for the rest of his life, but he was increasingly distant from his father.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp= 28, 152}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land in [[Macon County, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt; The following winter was very harsh, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]] to the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to [[New Orleans]] via flatboat on the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers.
 Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, but he was largely self-educated and an avid reader. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Sandburg|1974|p=10}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 At 6&amp;nbsp;foot 4&amp;nbsp;inches (1.93&amp;nbsp;m), he was unusually tall, as well as strong.
 Lincoln's father was uneducated and illiterate; however, he was extremely talented in the art of storytelling and entertaining friends. Thomas would regularly host friendly gatherings at his house, which would usually consist of Thomas telling stories all night causing a hilarious uproar from his audience. Stealthily, young Abraham would stay up and listen to his father telling stories, trying to memorize them himself. Occasionally, when Abraham could not understand a certain story or part of one, he would repeat it over and over again in his mind until he finally understood. He then would spend countless hours coming up with a way to put the stories into terms his friends could easily understand. The next day, Abraham would repeat these stories to his friends, mimicking his father. This early practice helped prepare Abraham for the many important speeches he would have to give later in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;teamofrivals&quot;&gt;

 ===Marriage and family===

 |[[Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln]] &amp; [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]}}
 [[File:Mary Todd Lincoln.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Todd Lincoln]], wife of Abraham Lincoln]]
 On November 4, 1842 Lincoln married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in [[Springfield, Illinois]] on August 1, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard College]].
 The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teenage years.&lt;ref&gt; [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] was born on March 10, 1846, and died on February 1, 1850, also in Springfield. [[William Wallace Lincoln|William &quot;Willie&quot; Wallace Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in [[Washington, D.C.]], during President Lincoln's first term. [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]] was born on April 4, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago. Lincoln's last known lineal descendant, [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died December 24, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln’s first love was [[Ann Rutledge]].  He met her when he first moved to New Salem and by 1835 they had reached a romantic understanding.  However, Ann died on August 25, probably of typhoid fever.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1995) pp. 55-58&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, in either 1833 or 1834, he had met Mary Owens, the sister of his friend Elizabeth Abell, when she was visiting from her home in Kentucky.  In 1836, in a conversation with Elizabeth, Lincoln agreed to court Mary if she ever returned to New Salem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrlincolnandfriends.org/inside.asp?pageID=104&amp;subjectID=11 |title=Mrs. Elizabeth Abell |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary did return in November 1836 and Lincoln courted her for a time, however they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837 Lincoln wrote her a letter from Springfield, to which he had moved that April to begin his law practice, suggesting the relationship should end. She never replied and the courtship was over.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1995) pp. 67-69.  Thomas (1952) pp. 56-57, 69-70.  Donald quotes a key phrase from the letter, “I now say, that you can now drop the subject [of marriage], dismiss your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me forever, and leave this letter unanswered, without calling forth one accusing murmur from me.”&lt;/ref&gt;  
 In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd, from a wealthy slaveholding family based in Lexington, Kentucky. They met in Springfield in December 1839. In November 1842, after an eighteen month break in their engagement, they were married in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. In 1844, the couple settled into a quaint house on Eighth and Jackson in Springfield, near Lincoln's law office. Mary had a hard time adjusting to her new life because she was used to having slaves perform most of the chores all of her life; she was accustomed to wealth on a higher level than Lincoln at first could provide. The births of two sons within the first forty months of their marriage led to a stable marriage. The Lincolns did not believe in strict rules and tight boundaries when it came to their children.&lt;ref&gt; Jean Harvey Baker, ''Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography'' (2008), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;
 ==Early political career and military service==
 [[Image:Abe Lincoln young.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sketch of a younger Abraham Lincoln]]
 {{Main|Abraham Lincoln's early life and career|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
 Lincoln began his political career in March 1832 at age 23 when he announced his candidacy for the [[Illinois General Assembly]].  The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the [[Beardstown and Sangamon Canal|Sangamon River]]. Before the election he served as a captain in a company of the Illinois militia during the [[Black Hawk War]], although he never saw combat.  Lincoln returned from the militia after a few months and was able to campaign throughout the county before the August 6 election.  When the votes were counted, Lincoln finished eighth out of thirteen candidates (only the top four were elected), but he did manage to secure 277 out of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Donald pg. 41-46&lt;/ref&gt;
 In 1834, running as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] for the first time, he won an election to the state legislature and, after coming across the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', began to teach himself law. [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois that April and began to practice law with [[John T. Stuart]], Mary Todd's cousin, who lent Lincoln the law books that sparked his interest in that career path. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer. It is reputed that, had Stuart not lent Lincoln his law books, Lincoln would not have gone into a career in politics.&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 In 1841 Lincoln entered the law practice with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], a fellow Whig.
 He served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837 he made [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery|his first protest against slavery]] in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

 ===Illinois politics===
 [[Image:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in 1846 or 1847]]
 In 1846 Lincoln was elected to one term in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. A staunch Whig, Lincoln often referred to party leader [[Henry Clay]] as his political idol. As a freshman House member, Lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in Congress. He used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.&quot;
 Lincoln's most famous stand against Polk was in his [[Spot Resolutions]]: The war had begun with a violent confrontation on disputed territory (claimed by both Mexico and [[Texas]]), but Polk had insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded ''our territory'' shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our ''own soil''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web
 |url=http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/Willis/Civil_War/documents/LincolnSpot.html 
 |author=Abraham Lincoln
 |title=&quot;Spot Resolutions&quot;}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed, and proof that that spot was on American soil. Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, and its introduction resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district; one Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln.&quot;
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web

 |title=National Archives: Lincoln's Spot Resolutions}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln was a key early supporter of [[Zachary Taylor]]'s candidacy for the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 presidential election]]. When Lincoln's term ended, the incoming Taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote [[Oregon Territory]]. Acceptance would end his career in the fast-growing state of Illinois, so he declined. Returning instead to Springfield, Illinois, he turned most of his energies to making a living at the [[bar (law)|bar]], which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county.
 It was during this stage of his life, however, that Lincoln gave one of the most pivotal speeches&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 of his life - speaking not as a politician, but as a private citizen. Opposed to the 1854 [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], Lincoln spoke to a crowd in Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, 1854, outlining the moral, political, and economic arguments against slavery&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 that he would continue to uphold throughout his career. This speech marked his re-entry into public life.
 ===Prairie lawyer===
 By the mid-1850s, Lincoln faced competing transportation interests—both the river [[barge]]s and the [[rail transport|railroad]]s. Originally, Lincoln had favored riverboat interests. In 1849, he had received a [[patent]] for a &quot;device to buoy vessels over shoals.&quot;   Lincoln's goal had been to lessen the draft of a river craft by pushing horizontal floats into the water alongside the hull. The floats would have served as temporary [[ballast tank]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAH&quot;&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 The concept was never commercialized, but Lincoln is still the only person to both hold a patent and serve as President of the United States. As the 1850s began, Lincoln also argued cases on behalf of the railroad industry. In 1851, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer proposed Alton &amp; Sangamon route was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue Mr. Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.
 Lincoln's most notable criminal trial came in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of [[judicial notice]], a rare tactic at that time, to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a [[Farmers' Almanac]] to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based upon this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt; John J Duff, ''A. Lincoln Prairie Lawyer'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;
 ==Republican politics 1854&amp;ndash;1860==
 Lincoln returned to politics in response to the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as established by the [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Illinois Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed [[popular sovereignty]] as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by the national Congress.&lt;ref&gt;

 {{quote|[The Act has a] ''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate it.

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 }}
 Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted Free Soil, Liberty, and Democratic party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced, he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat [[Lyman Trumbull]]. At the Republican convention in 1856, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for Vice-President.
 In 1857-58, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]]. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|his famous speech]]: &quot;'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;William C. Harris 2007&quot;&gt;William C. Harris, ''Lincoln's Rise to the Presidency'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
 ===Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858===
 {{Main|Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858}}
 The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a famous contest on slavery. Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of [[republicanism]], while [[Stephen A. Douglas]] emphasized the supremacy of [[democracy]], as set forth in his [[Freeport Doctrine]], which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and could overrule judicial rulings. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star. New York party leaders invited him to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] in February 1860 to an elite audience that was startled by the poorly dressed, ugly man from the West. He stunned the audience with the most brilliant political speech they had ever heard. Lincoln was emerging as the intellectual leader of the Republican party, and its best speaker.&lt;ref&gt;
 Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression&quot; on a New York audience; Richard Carwardine, ''Lincoln'' (2003), p. 98; Harold Holzer, ''Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President'' (2006)

 {{Main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
 On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], Lincoln emerged as the Republican candidate on the third ballot, beating out more experienced candidates such as [[William Seward]] and [[Salmon P. Chase]].  Lincoln was chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals Seward and Chase. His &quot;Western&quot; origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the Civil War Came |author=Boritt, Gabor S. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1997-05-29 |isbn=0195113764 |pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|300px|thumb|1860 presidential election results]]
 As was the custom at the time, Lincoln did not campaign at all and gave no speeches.  The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North. They produced tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making an emphasis on his childhood poverty. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of &quot;free labor,&quot; whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. In the South, Lincoln did not appear on a majority of the ballots come the time of the election.&lt;ref&gt; William C. Harris, ''Lincoln's Rise to the Presidency'' (2007); Reinhard Luthin. ''The First Lincoln Campaign'' (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;
 On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in all of the Southern states. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election. Lincoln was the first President elected from Illinois, and the first elected with no Southern support.&lt;ref name=&quot;William C. Harris 2007&quot;/&gt;
 ==Presidency and the Civil War==
 {{Main|Origins of the American Civil War|Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War}}
 With the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which [[sectionalism|sectional tensions]] were played out. Although much of the West{{ndash}}the focal point of sectional tensions{{ndash}} was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. Yet they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.&lt;ref&gt; David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;
 ===Secession winter 1860–1861===
 {{Main|Baltimore Plot|Cornerstone Speech}}
 As Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] took the lead. By February 1, 1861, South Carolina was followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]. The upper South ([[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.
 Attempts at compromise, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]] which would have extended the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri line of 1820]], were discussed. Despite support for the Crittenden Compromise among some Republicans, Lincoln denounced it in private letters, saying &quot;either the Missouri line extended, or... Pop. Sov. would lose us everything we gained in the election; that filibustering for all South of us, and making slave states of it, would follow in spite of us, under either plan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

 President-elect Lincoln [[Baltimore Plot|evaded possible assassins in Baltimore]], and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C.
 [[Image:Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of the March 4, 1861 inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of [[United States Capitol]]]]
 At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the [[German American]] [[Turners]] formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection. In his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|first inaugural address]], Lincoln declared, &quot;I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments,&quot; arguing further that the purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] was &quot;to form a more perfect union&quot; than the [[Articles of Confederation]] which were ''explicitly'' perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?
 Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation.
 By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as [[Jeremiah S. Black]], [[Joseph Holt]], and [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. Believing that a peaceful solution was still possible, Lincoln decided to not take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.
 Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He &quot;temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis&quot;, overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.&lt;ref&gt;

 ===Fighting begins===
 {{Main
 |American Civil War}}
 In April 1861, after Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union,&quot; which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. [[Virginia]], which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Arkansas]].
 The slave states of [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]] did not secede. Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, [[Clement Vallandigham]], was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (''see'': [[Ex parte Merryman]]).
 Lincoln had to protect the nation's capital city. In May, angry secessionist mobs in [[Baltimore]], a city to the north of Washington, [[Baltimore riot of 1861|fought with Union troops traveling south]]. [[George William Brown]], the [[List of mayors of Baltimore, Maryland|Mayor of Baltimore]], and other suspect Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned at [[Fort McHenry]].&lt;ref&gt; Mark E. Neely Jr., ''The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
 ===Conducting the war effort===
 {{Main|Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War}}

Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], and [[Gideon Welles]] take a swing at the Lincoln administration]]
 The war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln immediately took an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that [[Washington, D.C.]] was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory.&lt;ref&gt; Donald (1995) pp 295-6 notes that major northern newspapers expected victory within 90 days.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], with the objective of capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.
 McClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''Harrison's Landing Letter'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]].&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 [[Image:A&amp;TLincoln.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 1864 [[Mathew Brady]] photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]]]]
 Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington.  Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] (September 1862).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|2005|p= 478-480}}.  Lincoln reappointed McClellan owing to his military prowess, not his personality&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] took command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web
 |accessdate=2008-05-21
 |url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/hookbio.htm
 |title=Joseph Hooker
 |publisher=Civil War Home}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent [[Gettysburg Campaign]] replaced by [[George Meade]].
 Using black troops and former slaves was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.  At first Lincoln was reluctant to fully implement this program, but by the spring of 1863 he was ready to initiate “a massive recruitment of Negro troops.”  In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, “The bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once.”&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1995) pp. 430-431&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of 1863, at Lincoln’s direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited twenty regiments of African Americans from the Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1995) p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;
 After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]]. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln replied, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Thomas|1952|p=315}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864 with a strategy of a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. The high casualty figures alarmed the nation, and, after Grant lost a third of his army, Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were. &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,&quot; replied Grant. Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support throughout the North, backed Grant to the hilt, and replaced his losses.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Thomas|1952|p=422-24}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 The Confederacy was out of replacements, so Lee's army shrank with every battle, forcing it back to trenches outside [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]. In April 1865, Lee's army finally crumbled under Grant's pounding, and Richmond fell.
 [[Image:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln, in a [[top hat]], with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at Antietam]]
 Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This same strategy allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan|Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and South Carolina. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate.&lt;ref&gt; Mark E. Neely Jr,, &quot;Was the Civil War a Total War?&quot; ''Civil War History'' vol. 50 #4 (Dec. 2004) pp. 434-458&lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln grasped the need to control strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and understood the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Only then could he relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''The War for the Union: The Organized War to Victory: 1864-1865'' (1971) pp. 8-10, 6-17; Brooks D. Simpson, ''Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph over Adversity, 1822-1865'' (2000) pp. 252-53&lt;/ref&gt;
 Throughout the war, Lincoln showed an intense interest with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from the field. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by scenes of war. During [[Jubal Anderson Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; a captain shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
 The Captain was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]];

 ===Emancipation Proclamation===
 {{Main|Abraham Lincoln on slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}
 {{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}
 Lincoln maintained that the powers of his administration to end slavery were limited by the Constitution. He expected to bring about the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any U.S. territory, and by convincing states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] if the state would outlaw slavery (an offer that took effect only in Washington, D.C.). Guelzo says Lincoln believed that shrinking slavery in this way would make it uneconomical, and place it back on the road to eventual extinction that the Founders had envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 In July 1862, Congress passed the Second Confiscation Act, which freed the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;
 It said that anyone aiding the rebellion would lose his slaves if convicted. &quot;That if any person shall hereafter incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States, or the laws thereof, or shall give aid or comfort thereto, or shall engage in, or give aid and comfort to, any such existing rebellion or insurrection, and be convicted thereof, such person shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and by the liberation of all his slaves....&quot; {{cite web

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. In that same month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.
 In a shrewdly penned August reply to an editorial by Horace Greeley in the influential ''New York Tribune'', with a draft of the Proclamation already on Lincoln's desk, the president subordinated the goal of ending slavery to the cause of preserving the Union, while, at the same time, preparing the public for emancipation being incomplete at first. Lincoln had decided at this point that he could not win the war without freeing the slaves, and so it was a necessity &quot;to do more to help the cause&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;

What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.

 The [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced on September 22, 1862 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not already under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate territory (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;

 In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], at the Loyal [[War Governors' Conference]] to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort.

 For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As [[Frederick Douglass]] observed, Lincoln was, &quot;The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

 ===Gettysburg Address===
 {{Main|Gettysburg Address}}
 Although the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was a Union victory, it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to Lincoln's war effort. As the Union Army decreased in numbers due to casualties, more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks. Lincoln's 1863 military drafts were considered &quot;odious&quot; among many in the north, particularly immigrants. The [[New York Draft Riots]] of July 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent.
 Writing to Lincoln in September 1863, the [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor of Pennsylvania]], [[Andrew Gregg Curtin]], warned that political sentiments were turning against Lincoln and the war effort:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;''If the election were to occur now, the result would be extremely doubtful, and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result, my impression is, the chances would be against us. The draft is very odious in the State... the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion, and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent, and the changes are against us.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-05-21 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d2604300))|title=Andrew G.

Retrieved on November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was delivered at the dedication of the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], four and a half months after the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies defeated those of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the decisive [[Battle of Gettysburg]].
 Abraham Lincoln's carefully crafted address, secondary to other presentations that day, came to be regarded as one of the greatest speeches in American history. In just over two minutes, Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and redefined the Civil War as a struggle not merely for the [[United States|Union]], but as &quot;a new birth of [[political freedom|freedom]]&quot; that would bring true equality to all of its citizens, and that would also create a unified nation in which [[states' rights]] were no longer dominant.
 Beginning with the now-iconic phrase, ''Four [[20 (number)|score]] and seven years ago...'', Lincoln referred to the events of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and described the ceremony at Gettysburg as an opportunity not only to consecrate the grounds of a cemetery, but also to dedicate the living to the struggle to ensure that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; Garry Willis, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Remade America'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
 ===1864 election and second inauguration===

 {{Main|United States presidential election, 1864}}
 After Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], and [[Chattanooga Campaign|Chattanooga]] in 1863, overall victory seemed at hand, and Lincoln promoted [[Ulysses S. Grant]] General-in-Chief on March 12, 1864. When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's strategy of wearing down [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected [[Andrew Johnson]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.
 [[File:ElectoralCollege1864.svg|300px|1864 Presidential election results|thumb]]
 Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref&gt;

 {{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected.

 Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.
 While the Democratic platform followed the [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace wing]] of the party and called the war a &quot;failure,&quot; their candidate, General [[George B. McClellan]], supported the war and repudiated the platform.
 Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to support Grant and win local support for the war effort. [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] capture of [[Atlanta]] in September ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln; the Union party was united and energized, and Lincoln was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but three states.&lt;ref&gt;
 There is a good discussion of Lincoln's 1864 election anxieties and the effect of Sherman's victory at Atlanta in James M. McPherson, ''Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief'' (New York: Penguin Press, 2008), 231-50.

 [[Image:Lincoln second.jpg|thumb|left|The only known photographs of Lincoln giving a speech were taken as he delivered his second inaugural address. Here, he stands in the center, with papers in his hand.]]
 On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and Lincoln was looking to the future.
 {{quote|Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray — that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.&quot; With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1955|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 ===Reconstruction===
 {{Main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
 Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the &quot;moderates&quot; regarding Reconstruction policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under [[Thaddeus Stevens]] in the House and [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Benjamin Wade]] in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;

 |title=Proclamation of Amnesty
 |publisher=[[Bartleby.com]]
 |year=1863}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were [[Tennessee]], where Lincoln appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as governor, and [[Louisiana]], where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10% of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=§20}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Near the end of the war, Lincoln made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and Sherman about ending hostilities (as Sherman managed a hasty visit to Grant from his forces in North Carolina at the same time);&lt;ref&gt;
 This meeting was memorialized in G.P.A. Healy's famous painting [http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html &quot;The Peacemakers.&quot;]
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln also was able to visit Richmond after it was taken by the Union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis|Jefferson Davis's]] own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot; When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Lincoln arrived back in Washington on the evening of April 9, 1865, the day Lee surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia. The war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref&gt;

 ===Redefining Republicanism===
 Lincoln's [[rhetoric]] defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. The [[Gettysburg Address]] defied Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; His second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted.
 In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], Lincoln shifted emphasis to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the foundation of American political values—what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 399}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential [[Cooper Union speech]], &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite book

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Foner|1970|p= 215}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|McPherson|1992|pp=61–64}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a &quot;republican form of government&quot; in every state.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 263}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].
 In his [[Gettysburg Address]] Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, &quot;that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of [[sovereignty|state sovereignty]]. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast, they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked &quot;a new founding of the nation.&quot;
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Wills|1993|p= 39}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 ===Civil liberties suspended===
 During the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a [[Union blockade|blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money before Congress appropriated it, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial.
 &lt;ref&gt;
 Neely (1992)
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 ===Domestic measures===
 Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, [[veto]]ing only those bills that threatened his war powers.&lt;ref&gt; David Donald, &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Whig in the White House,&quot; in Donald, ''Lincoln Reconsidered'' (2001), 133–47&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for state agricultural colleges in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillip Shaw Paludan 1994&quot;&gt;Phillip Shaw Paludan, ''The Presidency of Abraham Lincoln'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a Federal income tax (which was new). In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]].&lt;ref&gt;The first had become law under [[James Buchanan]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Lincoln signed legislation creating the first U.S. [[income tax]]. Marginal rates were 3% on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and 5% on income above $10,000. (Adjusted for inflation, $600 was the equivalent of $12,325 in 2007 US dollars). In 1864, income-tax rates were raised to 5% on incomes between $600 and $5,000, 7.5% on income between $5,000 and $10,000, and 10% tax on income above that.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillip Shaw Paludan 1994&quot;/&gt; 
 Lincoln also presided over the creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]]s of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. Congress created and Lincoln approved the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.  The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the [[United States Note]], the first [[banknote|paper currency]] in United States history since the [[Continental (currency)|Continentals]] that were issued during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]]. This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.  During the war, Lincoln's [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South—the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillip Shaw Paludan 1994&quot;/&gt; 
 In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], to put down the &quot;[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]&quot; in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 [[death warrant]]s for convicted [[Sioux#Isanti (Santee or Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers; Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for [[death penalty|execution]] (one was later [[reprieve]]d).&lt;ref&gt; Hank H. Cox, ''Lincoln And The Sioux Uprising of 1862'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
 Abraham Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States. Prior to Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had only been proclaimed by the federal government sporadically, and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation was during [[James Madison|James Madison's]] presidency fifty years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November to be a day of Thanksgiving, and the holiday has been celebrated annually at that time ever since.

 Originally, [[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, had formulated a plan to [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president.

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Learning that the President and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]].
 Without his main bodyguard [[Ward Hill Lamon]], to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play (&quot;You sock-dologizing old man-trap&quot;), hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug 0.44 caliber Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leaped to the stage and shouted &quot;''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''&quot; ({{lang-la|Thus always to tyrants}}) and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap.

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]). He was eventually cornered in a Virginia barn house and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.
 [[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|thumb|left|Lincoln's [[funeral train]] carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son, William, {{convert|1654|mi|km|abbr=off}} to Illinois]]
 An army surgeon, Doctor [[Charles Leale]], initially assessed Lincoln's wound as [[Mortal wound|mortal]]. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the [[Petersen House]], where he lay in a coma for nine hours before dying. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|U.S. Army Surgeon General]] [[Joseph Barnes|Joseph K. Barnes]] of the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]]. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=off}} inside his brain. Lincoln never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865. He was the first president to be assassinated or to [[Lying in state|lie in state]].
 Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois.&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, [[copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] celebrated the death of a man they considered a tyrant. The [[Lincoln Tomb]] in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is {{convert|177|ft|m|abbr=off}} tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] had it [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.

 ==Religious and philosophical beliefs==
 {{See|Abraham Lincoln and religion}}
 In March 1860 in a speech in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.&quot; The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined &quot;seriously as a man of ideas.&quot; Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] version of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[capitalism]] who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=18–19}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by &quot;an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.&quot; It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs.
 &lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;&gt;
 {{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=20}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Miller|2002|pp=57–59}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Even as a child, Lincoln largely rejected [[religion|organized religion]], but the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot; would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as &quot;that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.&quot;
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=15}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, &quot;I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.&quot;
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=514}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 As Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace.
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:
 {{quote|The [[will (philosophy)|will]] of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party—and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose. I am almost ready to say this is probably true—that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere quiet power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 Lincoln’s religious [[skepticism]] was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the [[John Locke|Lockean]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and classical liberalism, especially [[economic liberalism]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zsafth&quot;/&gt; Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies.
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=194}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,
 {{quote|I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&amp;nbsp;... It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men. This is a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform of the [[Know Nothing]]s. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.
 &lt;ref&gt;
 {{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=194–195}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the [[Bible]], that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation.

 ==Medical history and &quot;melancholy&quot;==
 Lincoln suffered from many illnesses throughout his life, including [[frostbite|frostbitten]] feet, [[malaria]], [[physical trauma]] and [[smallpox]].

 Claims that Lincoln had [[syphilis]] about 1835 have been controversial, but a recent analysis finds them credible.

 As a child, Lincoln was tall for his age. He reached his adult height of {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|2}} no later than age 21. Although well muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Fragmentary evidence says he weighed over 200 pounds in his mid-20s, but his official weight upon his taking office as president was 180 pounds, and he is believed to have weighed even less further along in his presidency.

 Based on Lincoln's unusual physical appearance, Dr. Abraham Gordon proposed in 1962 that Lincoln had [[Marfan syndrome]].

 Lincoln's unremarkable [[cardiovascular]] history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the theory, and today the diagnosis is considered unlikely.

 &lt;/ref&gt;
 Testing Lincoln's [[DNA]] for Marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s, but such a test was not performed.
 In 2007, Dr. John Sotos proposed that Lincoln had [[multiple endocrine neoplasia]], type 2B (MEN2B).
 &lt;ref&gt;

 |year=2008
 |url=http://www.physical-lincoln.com/}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;
 This theory suggests Lincoln had all the major features of the disease: a marfan-like body shape, large, bumpy lips, [[constipation]], [[hypotonia]], a history compatible with [[cancer]] and a family history of the disorder - his sons [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Eddie]], [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie]], and [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]], and probably his mother. The &quot;mole&quot; on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and &quot;pseudo-depression&quot; are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. Lincoln's longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B theory, which could be proven by DNA testing.  Sotos and medical historian [[Jacob Appel]] have recently campaigned to have such testing conducted on a pillowcase stained with Lincoln's blood that is owned by the Grand Army of the Republic Civil War Museum and Library in Philadelphia, an effort that has generated considerable debate among privacy advocates.

 Lincoln was regularly reported to suffer from &quot;melancholy&quot;. Some biographers have controversially diagnosed him with [[clinical depression]] and [[bipolar disorder]], but these theories have generally been dismissed.

 Mainly, his reported melancholy affected at times of great political stress or warfare and after losing a loved one, neither of which are unusual. He lost the two women (his mother and his sister) he loved very much when he was extremely young. This melancholy was also reinforced later in his life by the losses of his stepmother and his very first love, Ann Rutledge. Mary Lincoln felt her husband to be too trusting and his melancholy also struck at times he was betrayed or unsupported by those he put faith in.

 Other people have suggested that he was simply a private person who took solace in solitude. They argue that this can be seen in some of his actions as both a young boy and adult. Some of these actions included withdrawing himself from a crowd to read when he was a little boy, and even retreating to his privacy to find a solution to a problem. As an adult, Lincoln would often slip into depression, and emerge a short time later full of humor and happiness. Some people suggest that Lincoln's humor was actually a healthy way to cope with his depression.
 &lt;ref name=&quot;teamofrivals&quot; /&gt;
 Unlike the quiet, deep voice later used by impersonators and actors, Lincoln reportedly had a strikingly high-pitched speaking voice which aided him at times when he needed to be heard by crowds of thousands before the existence of microphones.&lt;ref&gt;http://civilwar.bluegrass.net/PoliticsAndPoliticians/abrahamlincoln2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his legendary talent as orator, he was said to have been shy and awkward in intimate social situations, especially in his youth.

 Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]-supporting [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln National Corporation]].

A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as Presidents Day as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.  The [[Abraham Lincoln Association]] was formed in 1908 to commemorate the centennial of Lincoln's birth.  The Association is now the oldest group dedicated to the study of Lincoln.
 To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission]] (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln's legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an advisory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln's birthplace: [[Hodgenville, Kentucky|Hodgenville]], [[Kentucky]].
 Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois.

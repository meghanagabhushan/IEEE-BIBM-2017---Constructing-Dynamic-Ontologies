The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is a midline thalamic nucleus
that responds strongly to exposure to various stressors. Many of the projection
targets of PVT neurons, including the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus
accumbens, and central/basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, are also activated by
stress. We sought to determine if PVT neurons that respond to stress are those
that project to one or more of these forebrain sites. Retrograde tract tracing
combined with immunohistochemical detection of Fos protein-like immunoreactivity
was used to assess the activation of target-specific populations of PVT
projection neurons by mild footshock stress in the rat. Stress markedly increased
Fos protein-like immunoreactivity in PVT neurons, but without regard to the
projection target of the thalamic neurons. Thus, the percentage of PVT cells that
were retrogradely labeled from either the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens,
or amygdala, and that expressed Fos-like immunoreactivity did not differ
substantially across the three forebrain sites. These data suggest that the PVT
may have a role as a generalized relay for information relating to stress, and
may serve an important role in the stress-induced activation of limbic forebrain
areas.

 Attempts at compromise  such as the   Crittenden Compromise   which would have extended the   Missouri Compromise Missouri line of         were discussed  Despite support for the Crittenden Compromise among some Republicans  Lincoln denounced it in private letters  saying  quot either the Missouri line extended  or    Pop  Sov  would lose us everything we gained in the election  that filibustering for all South of us  and making slave states of it  would follow in spite of us  under either plan quot   lt ref gt

 At his inauguration on March          the   German American     Turners   formed Lincoln's bodyguard  and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present  ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection  In his   Lincoln's first inaugural address first inaugural address    Lincoln declared   quot I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual  Perpetuity is implied  if not expressed  in the fundamental law of all national governments  quot  arguing further that the purpose of the   United States Constitution   was  quot to form a more perfect union quot  than the   Articles of Confederation   which were ''explicitly'' perpetual  thus the Constitution too was perpetual  He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract  would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it 
 Also in his inaugural address  in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war  Lincoln supported the pending   Corwin Amendment   to the Constitution  which had already passed Congress  This amendment  which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed  had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation 
 By the time Lincoln took office  the Confederacy was an established fact  and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms  No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible  Buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede  and some Republicans recommended that  However  conservative Democratic nationalists  such as   Jeremiah S  Black      Joseph Holt    and   Edwin M  Stanton   had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January          and refused to accept secession  Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March       the Union could not be dismantled  Believing that a peaceful solution was still possible  Lincoln decided to not take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first  This finally happened in April      
 Historian   Allan Nevins   argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union  hold government property  and still avoid war  He  quot temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis quot   overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states  and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states  lt ref gt

  American Civil War  
 In April       after Union troops at   Battle of Fort Sumter Fort Sumter   were fired upon and forced to surrender  Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling        troops to recapture forts  protect the capital  and  quot preserve the Union  quot  which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states    Virginia    which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state  responded by seceding  along with   North Carolina      Tennessee    and   Arkansas   
 The slave states of   Missouri      Kentucky      Maryland    and   Delaware   did not secede  Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there  promising not to interfere with slavery  After the fighting started  he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas and held in military prisons without trial  Over        were arrested  though none were executed  One    Clement Vallandigham    was exiled  but all of the remainder were released  usually after two or three months  ''see''    Ex parte Merryman

 The war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time  He had a contentious relationship with General   George B  McClellan McClellan    who became general in chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the   First Battle of Bull Run   and after the retirement of   Winfield Scott   in late       Despite his inexperience in military affairs  Lincoln immediately took an active part in determining war strategy  His priorities were twofold  to ensure that   Washington  D C    was well defended  and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt  decisive victory  lt ref gt  Donald        pp       notes that major northern newspapers expected victory within    days  lt  ref gt  McClellan  a youthful   United States Military Academy West Point   graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service  took a more cautious approach  He took several months to plan and execute his   Peninsula Campaign    with the objective of capturing   Richmond  Virginia Richmond   by moving the   Army of the Potomac   by boat to the   Virginia Peninsula peninsula   between the   James River James   and   York River  Virginia  York Rivers    McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln  as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington  D C  Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital  a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign 
 McClellan  a lifelong   Democratic Party  United States  Democrat   who was temperamentally conservative  was relieved as general in chief after releasing his ''Harrison's Landing Letter''  where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort  McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans  who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint   John Pope  military officer  John Pope    a Republican  as head of the new   Army of Virginia    Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north  thus protecting the capital from attack  However  Pope was soundly defeated at the   Second Battle of Bull Run   in the summer of       forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time  In response to his failure  Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the   Sioux    lt ref gt

 Hooker was routed by Lee at the   Battle of Chancellorsville    May        and relieved of command early in the subsequent   Gettysburg Campaign   replaced by   George Meade   
 Using black troops and former slaves was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation   At first Lincoln was reluctant to fully implement this program  but by the spring of      he was ready to initiate  a massive recruitment of Negro troops    In a letter to Andrew Johnson  the military governor of Tennessee  encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops  Lincoln wrote   The bare sight of fifty thousand armed  and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once   lt ref gt Donald        pp          lt  ref gt   By the end of       at Lincoln s direction  General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited twenty regiments of African Americans from the Mississippi Valley  lt ref gt Donald        p      lt  ref gt 
 After the Union victory at Gettysburg  Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general    Ulysses S  Grant    Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater  including the battles of Vicksburg and   Third Battle of Chattanooga Chattanooga    Responding to criticism of Grant  Lincoln replied   quot I can't spare this man  He fights  quot  lt ref gt

 Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure such as plantations  railroads  and bridges hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting  This same strategy allowed Generals   William Tecumseh Sherman Sherman   and   Philip Sheridan Sheridan   to destroy plantations and towns in the   Shenandoah Valley      Georgia  U S  state  Georgia    and South Carolina  The damage caused by   Sherman's March to the Sea   through Georgia totaled in excess of      million by Sherman's own estimate  lt ref gt  Mark E  Neely Jr    quot Was the Civil War a Total War  quot  ''Civil War History'' vol         Dec        pp          lt  ref gt 
 Lincoln grasped the need to control strategic points  such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg  and understood the importance of defeating the enemy's army  rather than simply capturing territory  He had  however  limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late       when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in   Ulysses S  Grant    Only then could he relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters  and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops  lt ref gt Allan Nevins  ''The War for the Union  The Organized War to Victory           ''        pp              Brooks D  Simpson  ''Ulysses S  Grant  Triumph over Adversity           ''        pp         lt  ref gt 
 Throughout the war  Lincoln showed an intense interest with the military campaigns  He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office  reading dispatches from the field  He visited battle sites frequently  and seemed fascinated by scenes of war  During   Jubal Anderson Early  's   Battle of Fort Stevens raid on Washington  D C    in       Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position  a captain shouted at him   quot Get down  you damn fool  before you get shot  quot  lt ref gt

 Lincoln maintained that the powers of his administration to end slavery were limited by the Constitution  He expected to bring about the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any U S  territory  and by convincing states to accept   compensated emancipation   if the state would outlaw slavery  an offer that took effect only in Washington  D C    Guelzo says Lincoln believed that shrinking slavery in this way would make it uneconomical  and place it back on the road to eventual extinction that the Founders had envisioned  lt ref gt

 The goal was to weaken the rebellion  which was led and controlled by slave owners  While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery  the   Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Thirteenth Amendment   did that   the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels  In that same month  Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet 
 In a shrewdly penned August reply to an editorial by Horace Greeley in the influential ''New York Tribune''  with a draft of the Proclamation already on Lincoln's desk  the president subordinated the goal of ending slavery to the cause of preserving the Union  while  at the same time  preparing the public for emancipation being incomplete at first  Lincoln had decided at this point that he could not win the war without freeing the slaves  and so it was a necessity  quot to do more to help the cause quot   lt ref gt

 Although the   Battle of Gettysburg   was a Union victory  it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to Lincoln's war effort  As the Union Army decreased in numbers due to casualties  more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks  Lincoln's      military drafts were considered  quot odious quot  among many in the north  particularly immigrants  The   New York Draft Riots   of July      were the most notable manifestation of this discontent

 Abraham Lincoln's carefully crafted address  secondary to other presentations that day  came to be regarded as one of the greatest speeches in American history  In just over two minutes  Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the   United States Declaration of Independence Declaration of Independence   and redefined the Civil War as a struggle not merely for the   United States Union    but as  quot a new birth of   political freedom freedom   quot  that would bring true equality to all of its citizens  and that would also create a unified nation in which   states' rights   were no longer dominant 
 Beginning with the now iconic phrase  ''Four       number  score   and seven years ago   ''  Lincoln referred to the events of the   American Civil War Civil War   and described the ceremony at Gettysburg as an opportunity not only to consecrate the grounds of a cemetery  but also to dedicate the living to the struggle to ensure that  quot government of the people  by the people  for the people  shall not perish from the earth quot   lt ref gt  Garry Willis  ''Lincoln at Gettysburg  The Words That Remade America''        lt  ref gt

   quote Fondly do we hope   fervently do we pray   that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away  Yet  if God wills that it continue  until all the wealth piled by the bond man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk  and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash  shall be paid by another drawn with the sword  as was said three thousand years ago  so still it must be said  quot the judgments of the Lord  are true and righteous altogether  quot  With malice toward none  with charity for all  with firmness in the right  as God gives us to see the right  let us strive on to finish the work we are in  to bind up the nation's wounds  to care for him who shall have borne the battle  and for his widow  and his orphan   to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace  among ourselves  and with all nations  lt ref gt   harvnb Basler      p       lt  ref gt 
   
    Reconstruction   
   Main Reconstruction era of the United States  
 Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves  Lincoln led the  quot moderates quot  regarding Reconstruction policy  and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans  under   Thaddeus Stevens   in the House and   Charles Sumner   and   Benjamin Wade   in the Senate  though he cooperated with these men on most other issues   Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South  Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines  His   Ten percent plan Amnesty Proclamation   of December          offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office  had not mistreated Union prisoners  and would sign an oath of allegiance  lt ref gt

 Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered  Of special importance were   Tennessee    where Lincoln appointed   Andrew Johnson   as governor  and   Louisiana    where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when     of the voters agreed to it  The Radicals thought this policy too lenient  and passed their own plan  the   Wade Davis Bill    in       When Lincoln   Pocket veto pocket vetoed   the bill  the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana  Arkansas  and Tennessee  lt ref gt

 Near the end of the war  Lincoln made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point  Virginia  This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and Sherman about ending hostilities  as Sherman managed a hasty visit to Grant from his forces in North Carolina at the same time   lt ref gt

 Lincoln also was able to visit Richmond after it was taken by the Union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at   Jefferson Davis Jefferson Davis's   own desk  symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land  He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves  whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote   quot I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him  quot  When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated  Lincoln replied   quot Let 'em up easy  quot  lt ref gt

    Redefining Republicanism   
 Lincoln's   rhetoric   defined the issues of the war for the nation  the world  and posterity  The   Gettysburg Address   defied Lincoln's own prediction that  quot the world will little note  nor long remember what we say here  quot  His second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted 
 In recent years  historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of   Republicanism in the United States republican values    As early as the     s  a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the   United States Constitution Constitution    Lincoln shifted emphasis to the   United States Declaration of Independence Declaration of Independence   as the foundation of American political values what he called the  quot sheet anchor quot  of republicanism  lt ref gt 
   harvnb Jaffa      p       
  lt  ref gt 
 The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all  rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers  shifted the debate  As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential   Cooper Union speech     quot Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself  quot  lt ref gt

 Nevertheless  in      Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms  the Constitution was a contract  and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree   and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a  quot republican form of government quot  in every state  lt ref gt

 That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in   Reconstruction era of the United States Reconstruction   
 In his   Gettysburg Address   Lincoln redefined the American nation  arguing that it was born not in      but in        quot conceived in Liberty  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal  quot  He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality   quot that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom   and that government of the people  by the people  for the people  shall not perish from the earth  quot  By emphasizing the centrality of the nation  he rebuffed the claims of   sovereignty state sovereignty    While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast  they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked  quot a new founding of the nation  quot

 During the Civil War  Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded  he used his war powers to proclaim a   Union blockade blockade    suspended the writ of   habeas corpus    spent money before Congress appropriated it  and imprisoned        suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial

 Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government  tariffs  a policy with long precedent   and a Federal income tax  which was new   In       Lincoln signed the second and third   Morrill Tariff    lt ref gt The first had become law under   James Buchanan   lt  ref gt  In       Lincoln signed legislation creating the first U S    income tax    Marginal rates were    on incomes between      and         and    on income above           Adjusted for inflation       was the equivalent of         in      US dollars   In       income tax rates were raised to    on incomes between      and              on income between        and          and     tax on income above that  lt ref name  quot Phillip Shaw Paludan      quot   gt  
 Lincoln also presided over the creation of the system of national banks by the   National Banking Act  s of             and       which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system  Congress created and Lincoln approved the   United States Department of Agriculture Department of Agriculture   in       although that institution would not become a Cabinet level department until        The Legal Tender Act of      established the   United States Note    the first   banknote paper currency   in United States history since the   Continental  currency  Continentals   that were issued during the   American Revolutionary War Revolution    This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war   During the war  Lincoln's   United States Department of the Treasury Treasury Department   effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy  lt ref name  quot Phillip Shaw Paludan      quot   gt

 In March      in a speech in   New Haven  Connecticut New Haven      Connecticut    Lincoln said  with respect to slavery   Whenever this question shall be settled  it must be settled on some philosophical basis  No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained  quot  The philosophical basis for Lincoln s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined  quot seriously as a man of ideas  quot  Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American   Whig Party  United States  Whig   version of   liberalism liberal     capitalism   who  more than most politicians of the time  was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs

 There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln s moral and intellectual development and perspectives  There was no teacher  mentor  church leader  community leader  or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development  Lacking a formal education  Lincoln s personal philosophy was shaped by  quot an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning  quot  It was Lincoln s reading  rather than his relationships  that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs

 Even as a child  Lincoln largely rejected   religion organized religion    but the   Calvinism Calvinistic    quot doctrine of necessity quot  would remain a factor throughout his life  In      Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as  quot that the human mind is impelled to action  or held in rest by some power  over which the mind itself has no control  quot

 In April       in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation  Lincoln wrote   quot I claim not to have controlled events  but confess plainly that events have controlled me  Now  at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party  or any man devised  or expected  God alone can claim it  quot

 As Lincoln matured  and especially during his term as president  the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions  On a personal level  the death of his son Willie in February      may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace 
  lt ref gt 
   harvnb Wilson      pp          
  lt  ref gt 
 After Willie s death  in the summer or early fall of       Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why  from a divine standpoint  the severity of the war was necessary 
   quote The   will  philosophy  will   of God prevails  In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God  Both may be  and one must be  wrong  God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time  In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party and yet the human instrumentalities  working just as they do  are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose  I am almost ready to say this is probably true that God wills this contest  and wills that it shall not end yet  By his mere quiet power  on the minds of the now contestants  He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest  Yet the contest began  And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day  Yet the contest proceeds  lt ref gt   harvnb Wilson      p       lt  ref gt   
 Lincoln s religious   skepticism   was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the   John Locke Lockean     Age of Enlightenment Enlightenment   and classical liberalism  especially   economic liberalism    lt ref name    quot zsafth quot   gt  Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party  Lincoln would often use the   United States Declaration of Independence Declaration of Independence   as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies 
  lt ref gt 
   harvnb Guelzo      p      
  lt  ref gt 
 In a February          speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said 
   quote I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence  amp nbsp     It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from the motherland  but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty  not alone to the people of this country  but  I hope  to the world  for all future time  It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men  This is a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence  lt ref gt   harvnb Jaffa      p       lt  ref gt   
 He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the   nativism  politics  nativist   platform of the   Know Nothing  s  In claiming that all men were created free  Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement  expanded education  territory to grow  and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population 
  lt ref gt 
   harvnb Guelzo      pp          
  lt  ref gt 
 It was the Declaration of Independence  rather than the   Bible    that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery  He saw the Declaration as more than a political document  To him  as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders  it was  foremost  a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation

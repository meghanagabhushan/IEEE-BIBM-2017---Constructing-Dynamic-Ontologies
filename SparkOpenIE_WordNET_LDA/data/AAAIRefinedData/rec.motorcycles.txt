A couple of years ago I replaced the stock windscreen on my Interceptor
with a higher one from National Cycle  The thing happens to be made of
Lexan

Can anyone recommend a polish to use on it that is safe for lexan  Its
starting to show a few scratches and id like to polish them out
Go FAST              Internet  wilkenplainsnodakedu        AMA

Suggest McQuires  plastic polish  It will help somewhat but nothing 
will remove deep scratches without making it worse than it already is
McQuires will do something for fine or light stuff

Also suggest calling your local plastic shop  In Calif TAP PLASTIC is
a chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes
replacement of plastic bits  Telephone in the Bay area is 
I'm not sure how amenable they are to shipping  I have found that they
have several excellent products for cleaning and removing crap from
windscreens and face shields  Also they have one called liftit which
works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic
wihtout scratching same

Luck

			How do I get a DoD number

If the most Frequently Asked Question in recmotorcycles is What is the
DoD then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be How do I
get a DoD number That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
KotL accept no substitue Keepers for a number If you're feeling
creative and your favorite number hasn't been taken already you can
make a request subject to KotL approval Warning nonnumeric non
base number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL Not
that you won't get it but you will pay for it

Oh and just one little tiny suggestion Ask the KotL in email You'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net and you'll look like a clueless newbie too

By now you're probably asking So who's the KotL already Well as
John Sloan notes below that's about the only real secret left around
here but a few unsubtle hints can be divulged First it is not myself
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe  though John was
the original KotL Second in keeping with the true spirit of Unix the
KotL's first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters  the KotL shares his name with a line
oriented text utility Third he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie
mailers Fourth there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
DeadHead

 Newsflash A message from the KotL 

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done  Your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp
days perhaps even horrors a week or two  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it
just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader  If you suspect mailer problems at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think
the KotL memorizes the list



One more thing the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be So provide some information for the list will ya
The typical DoD List entry contains number name statecountry 
email address For example

Ed GreenCAedgreenEastSunCOM

PS While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership that's not strictly true these days as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both

            Denizens of Doom by Bruce Tanner DoD 

      Road Rider August  reprinted with Bruce's permission

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops  
helmets antifog shields spine protectors aerodynamics threeangle valve
seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy 
traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double 
entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that 
although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each 
other face to face  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer

The computers range from laptops to multimillion dollar computer centers  
the people range from college and university students to hightech industry 
professionals to publicaccess electronic bulletinboard users  Currently 
recmotorcycles pronounced wreckdotmotorcycles it's the file name for 
the group's primary online meeting place carries about  articles per 
month  it is read by an estimated  people  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club the Denizens of Doom usually referred 
to as the DoD

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name Denizen 
of Doom  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr  Keeper of 
the Flame  Bruce was then designated DoD nr  retroactively and of 
course Nickerson the originator of the parodies was given DoD nr 

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many so John Sloan  DoD nr   became Keeper of the 
List issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one  To date there have been 
almost  memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada as well as Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom France 
Germany Norway and Finland

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch  The initial run 
of  patches sold out immediately  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation  Another AMHF fund raiser  
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members  was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later  Again the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation  So far the Denizens have contributed over  
to the AMA museum  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum

As often as possible the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near DenverBoulder Colorado and in California's 
Silicon Valley  Consequently two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado and the Northern versus Southern California 
Joust

The RideandFeed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass followed by a big 
barbecue dinner  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south riders from Southern California to ride north 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle  An additional plan 
for  is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus Ohio in July

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub recmotorcycles will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of twowheeled camaraderie it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together  Long may they flame


Live to Flame  Flame to Live	centerbar

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do 
anything like that face to face  These insults are known as flames  
issuing them is called flaming  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network  A 
typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like  What an incredibly stupid statement you Spandexclad 
poseur  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding 
ability and your cat



          The Denizens of Doom The Saga Unfolds

                  by John Sloan  DoD 

Periodically the question What is DoD is raised This is one of
those questions in the same class as Why is the sky blue If there
is a God why is there so much suffering in the world and Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition
and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the
halls of academe for generations 

A long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on
a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership  wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of recmotorcycles and
signed it The Denizen of Doom Not wishing to identify himself he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD  to post it for him DoD  not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual did so  Flaming and other amusements followed 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership  thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while being the sort that is pretty
easily amused so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club and started signing his postings with his membership
number 

Perhaps readers of recmotorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized
electronically  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a
gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet
feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup A club organized
and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail with a membershipmailing list
often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating
around the country organized by DoD  club patches organized by
 and even an MTVstyle music video produced by  and
distributed on VHS by  

Where will it end Who knows Will the DoD start sanctioning races
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the onboard engine
management computers Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a sized UNIX system Only time will tell 

The DoD has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles To become a member one need only
ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which
includes name state and email address 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name 

                  Live to Flame  Flame to Live

material and viewer discretion is advised 



          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E Quist   DoD 


Scene  A sterile engineering office  A lone figure whom we'll call
Chuck stands by a printer output bin wearing a white CDC lab coat
with  mechanical pencils in a pocket protector 

editor's note For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD UniCoastal Ironhorse Ride  Joust by denizens
referring to each other as Chuck I guess you had to be there I
wasn't 

Chuck  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst
 cowtowing to the whims of a machine and saying yessir nosir
 mayIhaveanothersir  My mother made me do it  I wanted
 to live a man's life
Music slowly builds in background
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys
 living the life of a Motorcyclist
 doing donuts and evading the police
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children
 eating small dogs for tea and large dogs for dinner  In short

	I Want to be      A Denizen

Chuck rips off his lab coat revealing black leather jacket with
fringe boots and cap  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass  A small throng of Hell's Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background gunning their engines
showering lookerson with nails as they turn donuts and leaking oil
on the tarmac  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy 

Chuck Sings to the tune of The Lumberjack Song

I'm a Denizen and I'm okay
I flame all night and I ride all day

Hell's Angels Echo Chorus surprisingly heavy on tenors
He's a Denizen and he's okay
He flames all night and he rides all day

I ride my bike
I eat my lunch
I go to the lavat'ry
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline
Running children down with glee

Chorus
He rides his bike
He eats his lunch
He goes to the lavat'ry
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline
Running children down with glee

Chorus refrain
'Cause He's a Denizen

I ride real fast
My name is Chuck
It somehow seems to fit
I overrate the worst bad fck
But like a real good sht

Oh I'm a Denizen and I'm okay
I flame all night and I ride all day

Chorus refrain
Oh He's a Denizen

I wear high heels
And bright pink shorts
 full leathers and a bra
I wish I rode a Harley
 just like my dear mama

Chorus refrain



                    Why you have to be killed

Well the first thing you have to understand just in case you managed
to read this far and still not figure it out is that the DoD started
as a joke And in the words of one Denizen it intends to remain one

Sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked What does DoD
stand for It's not the Department of Defense is it Naturally a
Denizen who had watched the movie Top Gun a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied

That's classified we could tell you but then we'd have to kill you

And the rest is history

A variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for Notable contributions and contributers where
known include

Daughters of Democracy DoD 		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair DoD 		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file



                     The recmotophoto archive

First a bit of history this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a recmotorcycles photo album Many copies were made
and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in
unknown locations Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp  email access but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive

Not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk
at their motorcycles A few nonphoto files are available from the
server too they include the DoD membership list the DoD Yellow Pages
the general recmotorcycles FAQ and this FAQ posting

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive



Via ftp

cerritosedu 

Via email

The address is servercerritosedu  The commands are given in the body of the
message  The current commands are DIR and SEND given one per line  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications  For
recmotophoto the file spec is DODfile  For example you can send

dir dod
send dodbrucetannergif
send doddodframeps

and you'll get back  mail messages a directory listing  uuencoded parts
of brucetannergif and the dodframeps file in ASCII

Oh wildcards  are allowed but a maximum of  mail messages rounded up to
the next whole file are send  A 'send dodgif' would send  files of
K each not a good idea

Cerritos College    Norwalk CA             cerritostanner



A couple of comments Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so
why not drop him a note if you find the recmotophoto archive useful
Second since Bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours California time 



                      Patches What patches

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches 
pins And your reaction was probably I want or That's sick or
perhaps That's sick I want

Well there's some good news and some bad news The good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of DoDlabeled widgets created The bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them This isn't
because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no
DoD store that keeps a stock All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets The typical procedure is
someone says I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made they'll cost
xxxx with xxxx going to the AMA museum Anyone want one Then
orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
prepaid orders is produced and quickly consumed So if you want a
DoD doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all
this is anarchy in action

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise and
perpetrators Patches DoD pins DoD stickers DoD
motorcycle license plate frames DoD tshirts DoD polo shirts
DoD Zippo lighters DoD LtF FtL belt buckles DoD and
patches DoD a second batch was done and rapidly consumed by
popular demand

All profits have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum As of June  over  dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD If you visit the museum

Summer  saw more organized rides with the Joust in its third
year and the Ride  Feed going strong but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride RCR with bikers from as far north
as NH and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather GPNDG another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well  Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition

Also worth mentioning are The first recmotodirt ride held in the
MoabCanyonlands area of southern Utah Riders from  states showed up
riding everything from monster BMWs to ittybitty XRs to almostlegal
strokes  And though it's not an official as if anything could be
official with this crowd recmoto event the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah
European Denizens have staged some gathers too  Your ad here

    I hate to admit this and I'm still mentally kicking myself for it
 I rode the brand new KRT home last Friday night   miles in rain
 and darkness  No problems  Got it home and put it on the center stand
    The next day I pushed it off the center stand in preparation for going
 over to a friend's house to pose  You guessed it  It got away from me
 and landed on its right side  
    Scratched the lower fairing cracked the right mirror and cracked the
 upper fairing  
    DAMN am I stupid  It's going to cost me  to get the local
 body shop to fix it  And that is after I take the fairing off for them
 Still that's probably cheaper than the mirror alone if I bought a 
 replacement from BMW

You got off cheap  My sister's exboyfriend was such an incessant pain
in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes no way Jose that I
finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan CT last fall where
I had seen a nice used KRS in perfect condition  After telling
everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago
signing the liability waiver and getting his preflight off he went

Well not quite  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street
feeling good about myself made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash  I
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance
Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch  I stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty the shop manager slid
up beside me and asked Friend of yours Steve  Shit Matty
it could have been worse  That could been my FLHS

Jeff hadn't made it  inches  Witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him
Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage  Matty was quick
While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature  Twenty
minutes later when Jeff's color had paled to a flush Matty
presented him with an estimate of  for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing  That was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area not a new fairing  Or he could buy the
bike

I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly
afterwards to hook up with another piece of work except that Matty
told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went
uncontested

Bikers wave to bikers the world over  Whether or not Harley riders
wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars

  I am happy to say that some Harley riders in our area are better than most
that are flamed about here I riding a lowly sport bike no less and my
girlfriend were the recipient of no less than twenty waves from a group of
at least twentyfive Harley riders  I was leading a group of about four
sport bikes at the time FJCBRRRVFR  I initiated some of the
waves but not all  It was a perfect day and friendly riders despite some
brand differences made it all the better

Re Waving

I must say that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while
riding does a lot of good things to my mood While riding is a lot of fun by
itself there's something really special about having someone say to you Hey
it's a great day for a ride Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time
on the road on days like this with a gesture

Was sunny today for the first time in a week took my bike out for a spin down
to the local salvage yardbike shop ran into about  other people who were
down there for similar reasons there's this GREAT stretch of road on the way
down there no side streets lotsa leaning bends   Went on an
impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who 
I didn't know but who were my kinda people nonetheless

As a fellow commented to me while I was admiring his bike Hey it's not
what you ride it's that you ride As long as it has  wheels and an engine
it's the same thing

  What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling Couple hours 
 after you feel sober What Or should I just work with If I drink 
 tonight I don't ride until tomorrow

 hrdrink for the first  drinks
 hoursdrink for the next  drinks
 hoursdrink for the rest

These are fairly cautious guidelines and will work even if you happen to 
have a low tolerance or body mass
I think the cops and Don't You Dare Drink  Drive tm commercials will 
usually say hrdrink in general but after about  drinks and  hrs you 
could very well be over the legal limit 
Watch yourself

how do the helmetless do it

not as fast and they would probably enjoy eating bugs anyway

Every bit as fast as a dirtbike in the right terrain  And we eat
flies thank you

jeeps

you're supposed to keep the windscreen up

then why does it go down

snow skis

NO BUGS and most poeple who go fast wear goggles

So do most helmetless motorcyclists

The question still stands How do cruiser riders with no or negligible helmets
stand being on the highway at  mph on buggy summer evenings

Now maybe this isn't a big deal to some of you but it is to me  I was raised
in the South and part of my cultural heritage is waving at passersby  I
waved from the side of the road at passing cars when I drove I waved or
nodded or at least raised an index finger from the steering wheel  People
waved at me as I drove by 

I was raised in the South and I can attest that this is true  Why on
one particularly hot day as I was walking along the road some good
ole boys in a truck tossed me a cold beer  Of course they were going
 mph at the time

PS To prove this wasn't a fluke it happened to me again when I was out
riding on Wednesday an unsolicited wave Wow

Two questions that fascinate me

Check you local blue light special for a sale on lives

 Why are rednecks called rednecks

The origin of the slang is probably a reference to a sunburned neck
often obtained while performing honest work outdoors  The neck is
specified to distinguish these people whose shirtprotected chest and
back are pale from the elitist wealthy who in their idiotic quest
for darker skin pigmentation as a badge of leisure time overdo it and
get fullbody sunburns


More like those who use their backs instead of their minds to make
their living who are usually ignorant and intolerant of anything outside
of their group or level of understanding
 

Tuba Irwin      I honk therefore I am       CompuTracRichardsonTx
irwincmptrclonestarorg    DoD             R


That sounds like an awfully closed minded intolerant attitude

  '     

I'm not a redneck but    try a walk in their shoes first  Stereotypes
are usually of very limited value  I've seen as many ignorant
selfrighteous open minded new age lovers of the great planet Earth
as I have ignorant red necks  I don't see a correlation I don't
believe that the redneck culture if you can call it that is
necessarily inferior or superior to any other  

I gotta have a beer I'm making too much sense  Next thing you know
I'll be preaching tolerance    and I'm a conservative

When I broke my right leg in two places not a motorcycle accident  a 
car accident who woulda thunk it I put my crutches on Gretchen's rear
rack  I'm getting the metal rod pulled out on Friday and going back on 
the crutches for six weeks  I think crutches on the handlebars sound more 
aesthetically pleasing  How did you attach them


	When I got my knee rebuilt I got back on the street bike ASAP I put
the crutches on the rack and the passenger seat and they hung out back a

Hi Ravi

If you need a Harley we have lots to spare here All the yuppies
bought 'the best' a couple  of years ago to pose at the swine
bar They 'rode a mile and walked the rest' Called a taxi home and 
went back to the porsche So there's are loads going cheap with about
  miles on the clock takes a while to coast to a halt

Even a half a beer will increase your confidence while slugging your reactions

for any length of time without stacking the odds I'll not ride after ANY

getting out of bed in the morning is risky I sprained my ankle

Damn right I was late for a climbing meet one morning so I got
out of bed without bothering that my right foot was still asleep
It reminded me by folding underneath with a crunching of Metatarsals
Lucky the brake's on the right but i got funny looks riding thru

 What protective gear is the most important I've got a good helmet shoei
 rf and a good thick jacket leather gold and a pair of really cheap
 leather gloves What should my next purchase be Better gloves boots
 leather pants what

IF you can remember to tuck properly the bits that are going to take most 
punishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet then hips and 
knees Get boots then  trousers The gloves come last as long as you've the 
self control to pull your arms in when you tuck If not get good gloves 
first  Hands are VERY easily wrecked if you put one down to steady your 
fall at mph The other bits heal easier

Once you are fully covered you no longer tuck just lie back and enjoy the 
ride

Best of all take a mean of all the contradictory answers you get

OK

    I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is  Lets begin
by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk   Additionally
it had a CBRRR style tank full fairing and only a tach  Now at
first I thought it was an 'RC' a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it  Additionally
the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk  They looked much more like 
RR gauges  Overall the bike looked like a RR except for the
rear singlesided swingarm and wheel there were straight from the Hawk

So what did I see

PS for any of you Boulder DoDers I saw it parked at the Engineering
center today It is white with light green stripes

I remember one artical where the reviewer
tried the radio on the bike not having had
one on any of his He stated that the bike
tended to go faster when the music was 
good I agree having felt like this my self

wanted a Zephyr and confused the Mercury with the Kawasaki   Oh
well they're better off with the Kawasaki anyways  Maybe it'll shake the

Not to imply that you didn't but since you didn't mention it

Two questions that fascinate me

Check you local blue light special for a sale on lives

 Why are rednecks called rednecks

The origin of the slang is probably a reference to a sunburned neck
often obtained while performing honest work outdoors  The neck is
specified to distinguish these people whose shirtprotected chest and
back are pale from the elitist wealthy who in their idiotic quest
for darker skin pigmentation as a badge of leisure time overdo it and
get fullbody sunburns


More like those who use their backs instead of their minds to make
their living who are usually ignorant and intolerant of anything outside
of their group or level of understanding

 Anyone try the spray on chain wax that was reviewed in one of the moto
 rags last month
 
 
 Yeah    I sprayed it all over my rear drive shaft housing and it didn't
 seem to make it any quieter at all 

Didn't you read the instructions first
You're supposed to spray it in your ears so you won't be
distracted by the chainnoise of the other bikes around you
That's why it's called Chain Wax

Castrol Syntec does not contain teflon it gets its greater
lubrication by bonding to the metal surfaces of the engine 
thus making the metal ride on the polymer rather
than having metaltometal contact I do not know if this 
also reduces the acid contact with the metal but it seems 
likely

Just becase something forms a resin does not mean that
it's not teflon based  The PTFE in slick is not teflon
either but it's still teflon based  

Teflon is a DuPontowned tradename for PTFE  Slick does
indeed use DuPont Teflon though some other brands of such
stuff may use imported PTFE of another brand

Teflon being a tradename should always by capitalized

DuPont disclaims any benefits of PTFE in the oil supply of internal

Oh lord  This is where I came in

Obcountersteer  For some reason I've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars rather than pushing on the other wrong
side if you get my meaning provides a feeling of greater control  For
example rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right Hi Lonny pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counterintuitive  Maybe
I need psychological help

Obcountersteer vAnyone else find it ironic that in the weekendanda
night MSF class they don't mention countersteering until after the
first day of riding

 Alan nothing personal but I object to the we all in that statement
 I was on many of those rides that Alan is describing  Pushing the
 envelope does not necessarily equal taking insane chances

Moreover if two riders are riding together at the same speed
one might be riding well beyond his abilities and the other
may have a safety margin left

Oh come on Phil  You're an excellent rider but you still take plenty of
chances  Don't tell me that it's just your skill that keeps you from 
getting wacked  There's a lot of luck thrown in there too  You're a very
good rider and a very lucky one too  Hope your luck holds 

Allan I know the circumstances of several of your falls
On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car  That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control

I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us but it seems that you're blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted

 What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling Couple hours after
you feel sober What Or should I just work with If I drink tonight I
don't ride until tomorrow

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going  in a  in my cage I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the creative excuses offered the judge by others

After listening to a number of Well I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up versions I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some  He was less than
impressed with any of them

This young rather burley looking guy had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of  mph in a  mph
zone  It was also noted that the defendant motorcycle rider had
alcohol on his breath but was not cited for this offence

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice Well son those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle  What do you have to say for
your self

Well Sir meekly the defenant replied I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home
He offered nothing more or less  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing  mph on his way home

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response fined him the
maximum in this case plus court costs of course and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school

Isn't America Great

  I had planned to get an HD this yearbut instead I
 took delivery on a brand new male offspringer last Monday
 
 Sounds like you should have been doing your planning LAST year given
 HarleyDavidson's product delivery lag and the human gestation cycle

Or perhaps any planning at all    Hiya Pete still got that CBX
Nice to hear from you again

 And yes I finally did figure out why this happens and I have
 taken steps to ensure a storkish repetition
 
 That would be low drag bars and way rad rearsets for the FJ so that the 
 ergonomic constraints would have contraceptive consequences

Ouch    This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the er step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBRRR and the GTSA

In article NAEMmcimailcom mcimailcom Peter Nesbitt writes
Riding to work last week via Hwy  from Suisun to I I was pulled over by
a CHP black and white by the  Gas station by Jameson Canyon Road  The
officer stated it looked like you were going kinda fast coming down
highway   You must have been going at least  or   I just said okay
and did not agree or disagree to anything he said 

  Can you beat this ticket  Personally I think it's your Duty As a Citizen
to make it as much trouble as possible for them so maybe they'll Give Up
and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon
  The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
your speed  Mr Brown the author of Fight Your Ticket mentions an
Oakland judge who convicted a speeder on the officer's testimony that
the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed
  You can pay off the State and your insurance company or you can
take it to court and be creative  Personally I've never won that way
or seen anyone win but the judge always listens politely  And I haven't
seen that many attempts
  You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the
cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing they therefore
appear to be further away and so their speed appears to be greater than
it actually is  I left out a step or two but you get the idea  If you
can make it convincing theoretically you're supposed to win
  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken  I did get to see
some other poor biker try it  He was mixing up various facts like
the maximum acceleration of a cop car and the distance at which
the cop had been pacing him and end up demonstrating that he couldn't
possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested  He'd
brought diagrams and a calculator  He was Prepared  He lost  Keep
in mind cops do this all the time and their word is better than yours
Maybe though they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time
Besides this guy didn't speak English very well and ended up absolutely
confounding the judge the cop and everyone else in the room who'd been
recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota
  Ahem  OK I'm better now  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation
been more polished  Maybe not  He did get applause

More like those who use their backs instead of their minds to make
their living who are usually ignorant and intolerant of anything outside
of their group or level of understanding

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash
The confusion is understandable as there is substantial overlap
between the two sets Let me see if I can clarify

Rednecks Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a
	living Usually somewhat ignorant by somebody's standards
	anyway because they have never held education above basic
	readingwritingmath skills to be that important to their
	eventual vocation Note I did not say stupid just ignorant
	They might be stupid but then so are some high percentage
	of any group

White trash White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the
	word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met only
	with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell
	 my father Genuinely lazy not just out of work or under
	qualified goodfornothing dishonest white people who are
	mean as snakes The squeal like a pig boys in Deliverance
	may or may not have been rednecks but they were sure as hell
	white trash

White trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their
group or level of understanding Rednecks may or may not be

  I sprained my right ankle once and kept riding 
When I broke my right leg in two places 

I had knee surgery while I was in the Navy back in   The 
doctors put me in a cast from asstoankle  My only method of transportaion 
was a DOHC  Honda at the time  I found that by sliding back on the seat 
I could use my heel did I mention it was my left leg to operate the shift
I would hook the end of the lever with my heel and lift my entire leg for up
shifts and just drop my leg on the lever for the downshifts  Forget 
nutral took WAY too much finesse for the leg  The crutches were bungee
corded to the right side of the bike with the top resting on the passenger 
peg and the right turnsignal sticking through the hole in the crutches  
Every other day when I rode the  miles to Physical Therapy tourture 
sessions the doc would give me hell about riding a bike much less riding in 
my condition  Didn't stop me tho BP

BTW  This is the same bike I assembled in my second floor barracks room and 
rode down the stairs when it was completed

   I am not paid to have an opinion

   The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
 your speed  Mr Brown the author of Fight Your Ticket mentions an
 Oakland judge who convicted a speeder on the officer's testimony that
 the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed

cough choke  WHAT  if a cop gave me a ticket for sounding like
i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without a lawyer simply
because sounding like speeding is ridiculous  if i was found guilty
i'd appeal and then show up with a lawyer

if a cop doesn't do one of

VASCAR from car or plane
RADAR LIDAR other electronic speed measuring device
pace me

and i'm within mph or so of the limit i'd go to court  i can accept a
cop seeing me going excessively fast like  over the limit but
he looked like he was going  or so in a  zone is not beyond a
reasonable doubt  granted i may well lose the case but  in a  measured
by eye  take it to court for sure

 That would be low drag bars and way rad rearsets for the FJ so that the 
 ergonomic constraints would have contraceptive consequences

Ouch    This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the er step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBRRR and the GTSA

I dunno on my old GSE the tankseat junction was nice and smooth
But if you were to travel all the way forward you'd collect the top
tripleclamp in a sensitive area I'd hate to have to make the choice
but I think I'd prefer the FJ's gas tank

the cop won't show up  Secondly if he does show up you should point
out that he lied purgered on the ticket  Why   I beleive that if

What's the feeling about eating and riding  I went out riding this
weekend and got a little carried away with some pecan pie  The whole
ride back I felt sluggish  I was certainly much more alert on the
ride in  I'm sure others have the same feeling but the strangest
thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides

From now on a little snack will do  I'd much rather have a get that
fullsluggish feeling closer to home

depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the
knocks on themsuch as being much slower

It depends on how badly you want to live  The FAA says eight hours bottle

a bloodalcohol level of  as legally drunk I think which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums

BTW alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate  one beerhour will

 I think I've found the ultimate summer job It's dangerous involves

 What was your experience
 
Stuff deleted
   Get a good AtoZ type indexed streetmap for all of the areas  you're
   likely to work   Always carry  plenty of blackplastic  bin liners  to

Check with the local fire department  My buddy is a firefighter and they
have these small map books which are Amazing  They are compact easy to
use no folding  They even have a cross reference section in which you
match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to
and it details the quickest route  They gave me an extra they had laying
around  But then again I know all those people I'm not really sure if they
are supposed to givesell them The police may also have something
similar

The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike given
the metal frame and all I have a big backrest approx  high and

Any one have any experiences on such experimentation

Taking the idea further what would happen if the backpack was fully

be very severly affected How will the bike perform with such a load 
clinging to the back rest If I really secure it with no shifting 
do I still increase my chances of surfing

Mind you all that's for getting too drunk to drive a car  I may only
have been riding for a month or so but I plan my evenings with a very
rigid exclusive or statement Either don't drink or don't ride
Pretty simple

 
 These are fairly cautious guidelines and will work even if you happen to 
 have a low tolerance or body mass
 I think the cops and Don't You Dare Drink  Drive tm commercials will 
 usually say hrdrink in general but after about  drinks and  hrs you 
 could very well be over the legal limit

 Indeed especially if you are smart and eat some food with your
 drink The food coating the stomach lining especially things like
 milk can temporarily retard the absorption of alcohol When the
 food is digested the absorption will proceed and you will
 actually be drunker ie have a higher instantaneous BAC than
 you would have been if you had drunk  drinkhr on an empty stomach
 
 Put another way food can cause you to be less drunk than drinking on
 an empty stomach early on in those five hours but more drunk than
 drinking on an empty stomach later in those five hours

  officer stated it looked like you were going kinda fast coming down
  highway   You must have been going at least  or   I just said okay
  and did not agree or disagree to anything he said 
 

 The next time you get stoped by a cop never never never admit to anything

 Don't volunteer any information

 When a retoracle question is ask by the cop like it looked like you were going kinda fast coming down highway   You must have been going at least  or   the correct reponse is to deny it This technique is employed by police to help establish guilt especially when  times out of  heshe is not sure who was doing the speeding If the cop is unsure this may be the difference of him letting you off the hook or getting the tissue

Hope this helps for next time

first I thought it was an 'RC' a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it  Additionally

I think I've seen this bike  Is it all white with a seagreen stripe
and just 'HONDA' for decals I've seen such a bike numerous times over
by Sewall hall at CU and I thought it was a raceprepped CBR 
I didn't see it over at the EC parking lot I buzzed over there on my 
way home all of  block off my route  but it was gone

Is a single sided swingarm available for the CBR  I would imagine so 
kinda neccisary for quick tire changes  When I first saw it I assumed it
was a bike repainted to cover crash damage

 The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike given
 the metal frame and all I have a big backrest approx  high and
 was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest

 Any one have any experiences on such experimentation

Put the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest
If that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the
backrest just make sure it doesn't bend or break anything like the rear
fender or turnsignals

 By the way the shortlived Zephyr is essentially a GpZ 

Why was the Zephyr discontinued  I heard something about a problem with
the name but I never did hear anything certain 

Ford had an anemic midsized car by that name back in the last decade
I rented one once  That car would ruin the name Zephyr for any other
use

Ouch    This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the er step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBRRR and the GTSA

	When I'm riding my RR my goodies are already up
	against the tank because the design of the Corbin seat
	tends to move you forward

	Wouldn't the major danger to one's cajones be due to
	accelerating into and then being stopped by the tank  If
	you're already there there wouldn't be an impact
	problem would there

	While we're on the subject has anyone else noticed that the  deep

nut

	When I took the socket in for an exchange EVERY  one of the 
deep well sockets on the rack had the exact same problem  Looking into the
socket it appears that Craftsman's toolmaker attempted to imitate flank drive
on this piece but did not account for the extra clearance needed inside the
socket

Never had any problem with mine

Are you SURE the nutbolt you are trying is really a  hex  mm
is just slightly larger  and a  wrench won't fit on a GM mm
nut my  GMC pickup has several mm nuts on it  really annoying metric

This morning a truck that had been within my sight and I within
his for about  miles suddenly forgot that I existed and pulled
over right on me  my front wheel was about even with the back
edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him

It was trivial enough for me to tap the brakes and slide behind him
as he slewed over with no signal of course on top of me with
my little horn blaring damn I need Fiamms but the satisfaction
of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough
especially when I later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made
no apologetic wave or anything

Is there some way that I can memorize the license plate of an
offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner
I'm not going to firebomb houses or anything I'd just like to
write a consciousnessraising letter or two I think that it would
be good for BDI cagers to know that We Know Where They Live
Maybe they'd use  or  brain cells while driving instead of the
usual

 Hey it works You could present the paragraph above to virtually any member
 of the nonmotorcycling public and they'll buy right into it
 
 Just about any argument you can produce in favor of banning helmetless
 riding can be used to argue in favor of banning motorcycles
 It's just a matter of degree

That's absurd That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming  It says that any agrgument
in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to 
which the precautions apply  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous
there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do therefore it is
a nonseqitur

Also even though most people do not ride motorcycles they do boat sail
jetski climb ski fly parachute hangglide glide bungeejump bike
skate rollerblade skateboard play rugby ouch mow the lawn rewire
the basement operate heavy machinery  and do a host of other 'dangerous'
things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban
Your little homily applies to all those things and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity
would be next is unlikely

put pistons in bores first then lower onto bottom end deleted

Has anybody actually carried out this procedure  I can visualize fewer
problems with canting pistons in the cylinders with this method but
more trouble with keeping the bores suspended especially for the first
two pistons and with working space to insert piston pins and clips
especially for the last two pistons

    It is certainly possible and quite easy in most cases especially
on twostrokes  It's very common to do this on bikes where the
cylindermounting throughstuds don't prevent the cylinder from being
removed with the engine in the frame
    I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian which was
easier yet because it does not have throughstuds  Base flange studs
and separate head bolts dontchaknow
    You have to use a little foresight rags duct tape etc to keep
clips from falling in clothespins hoseclamps etc to support the
cylinder while you're inserting the pins
    Are these called Gudgeon Pins in the UK If so what's a Gudgeon

What a great day Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing
in Colorado and put the battery back in the FXSTC Cleaned the plugs
opened up the petcock waited a minute hit the starter and bingo it
started up like a charm Spent a restless night anticipating the first
ride du saison and off I went this morning to get my state inspection
done Now my bike is stock so far except for HD slashcut pipes and
all went well with my New Hampshire State Inspection meaning all my
lights worked OK until the dude produces a decibel meter and tells me
about the new NH law about MC noisehuh  sez Iand he has me
start her up and rev to about  rpmI FAIL cuz I register  DB
and the max allowed is  If I fail with these pipes there are gonna
be a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go
for inspection



But hey its a new experience I have never really felt like a menace
to society before I parked dismounted and walked in to my building
with a slight swagger to my step and a narrow lidded look I sensed
my faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating statusand
women's glances seemed to linger just a little longeror perhaps
that was my imaginationsigh

Now I need to install my new BUB pipes and single fire ignitionI
wonder how I will do after that

I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor

No accident but my eyes were tearing so hard and I was wheezing
so loudly that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up

The duck BTW lived and seemed quite healthy though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes

The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button

According to BBC Radio this morning UK Denmark Portugal  a few
others have vetoed a proposal to limit ECsold bikes to  BHP  The
reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics  a
rare example of governmental wisdom  The limit has a five year
moratorium on it and specialist manufacturers will be exempt anyway 
Any suspicion that this is a crafty trick to restrict that end of the

  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken  I did get to see
some other poor biker try it  He was mixing up various facts like
the maximum acceleration of a cop car and the distance at which
the cop had been pacing him and end up demonstrating that he couldn't
possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested  He'd
brought diagrams and a calculator  He was Prepared  He lost  Keep
in mind cops do this all the time and their word is better than yours

Also keep in mind that cops will LIE in court to get their way don't get
me started by asking how I know  If you decide to fight you have to be ready
for this as well as devise strategy to make the cop's story doubtful in the
judgejury's mind

Maybe though they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time
Besides this guy didn't speak English very well and ended up absolutely
confounding the judge the cop and everyone else in the room who'd been
recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota
  Ahem  OK I'm better now  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation
been more polished  Maybe not  He did get applause

 One thing is certain though its still too cold  After about 
 minutes I had to stop and hold my muffler for a while  

Be VERY careful about this If youre really cold the muffler will
feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel
your hands off  I speak from experience You can also do all 
kindsa Americanism of the day damage to your circulation warming 
hands up on something too hot By far the best fastest and safest
way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves and
stand there like a Ming emporer for a while Five minutes should 
do it

first ride of the season

One thing is certain though its still too cold  After about 
minutes I had to stop and hold my muffler for a while  When I got
home after a few hours I kept all my gear on for about a half hour
in the house  F  humidity no wind protection and mph
do not mix well


Hell This is WARM I retired my fleece from under the Aerostich last 
month when the temperature got aboce  Try living a couple of years 
on the dole so you cant afford any heating You put the gear on in
October abd you take it off again in May Getting out on the bike 
seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere 
warm 

Its all relative


Happy cold riding

every spec of alertness to keep from getting squished otherwise it's not
only dangerous it's unpleasant The same goes for cold and fatigue as I
once took a half hour nap at a gas station to insure that I would make it

Yeah hypothermia is MUCH more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions
than people realise I wish I had the patience to stop when I should One
day I'll pay for it

If you  begin to shiver  STOP and warm up thoroughly If you leave it
till the shivering stops this doesnt mean you're OK again it means 
you're a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road  your brain
and body are working about as fast as a tree grows You will not realise
this yourself till you hit something The next stage is passing out 
This usually means falling off

So you can't ride the bike but you will drive truck home The
judgement and motor skills needed to pilot a moto are not required in a
cage This scares the sht out of me
  
This is a piece of psychology its essential for any long term biker to
understand People do NOT think 'if I do this will someone else suffer'
They assess things purely on' if I do this will I suffer

This is a vital concept in bikecage interaction

What's the feeling about eating and riding  I went out riding this
weekend and got a little carried away with some pecan pie  The whole
ride back I felt sluggish  I was certainly much more alert on the
ride in  I'm sure others have the same feeling but the strangest
thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides

From now on a little snack will do  I'd much rather have a get that

how do the helmetless do it

Um the same way people do it on 
horseback

not as fast and they would probably enjoy eating bugs anyway

Every bit as fast as a dirtbike in the right terrain  And we eat
flies thank you

Who mentioned dirtbikes We're talking highway speeds here If you go mph
on your dirtbike then feel free to contribute

jeeps

you're supposed to keep the windscreen up

then why does it go down

Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't A friend of mine just bought one
and it has more warning stickers than those little wheelers I guess that's
becuase it's a big  wheeler Anyway it's written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway from what he says To be fair I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers They may participate in this discussion but they're
probably few and far between so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers

snow skis

NO BUGS and most poeple who go fast wear goggles

So do most helmetless motorcyclists

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant the lower case part of the 
two parts of the statement Besides around here it is quite rare to see 
bikers wear goggles on the street It's either full face with shield or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses My experience of 
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that nonwraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes

The question still stands How do cruiser riders with no or negligible helmets
stand being on the highway at  mph on buggy summer evenings

helmetless  goggleless

Ok ok fine whatever you say but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs and my jacket would be a bloodsplattered
mess and I'd see guys with shorty helmets NO GOGGLES long beards and tight
tshirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens Lets be really
specific this time so that even Ed understands Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with one's face is fun or are there other reasons to do it
Image Laziness To make a point about freedom of bug splattering

Obcountersteer  For some reason I've discovered that pulling on the

example rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right Hi Lonny pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counterintuitive  Maybe
I need psychological help

I told a newbie friend of mine who was having trouble from the complicated
explanations of his rider course to think of using the handlebars to lean
not to turn Push the right handlebar down or pull left up or whatever
to lean right It worked for him he stopped steering with his tuchus

My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding
jacket  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford  for it right now

I'm considering two basic options

  Buy the Aerostich jacket only  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases but I'd imagine over 
    That may be pushing my limit  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit

  Buy some kind of leather jacket  I like a few of the new 
    HeinGericke FirstGear line however they may be a bit pricey
    unless I can work some sort of deal  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection enhanced pose
    value we all know how important that is  possibly cheaper
    than upper Aerostich

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
layers mainly a sizing thing if leather i'd prefer a zipout 
lining it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich elbows 
shoulders forearms possibly backkidney protection etc a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice ventilation would 
be a plus however it must be wearable in cold weather below
freezing with layers or perhaps electrics

Please fire away with suggestions comments etc

Hi I just have a small question about my bike 
Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZMechanic I just don't know what to 
think about my Honda 
She was using too much oil for the last  km on my trip to Daytona bike 
week this spring and all of a sudden she trailed smoke like hell and 
was running only on one cylinder 
I towed the bike home and took it apart but everything looks in perfect 
working order No cracks in the heads or pistons the cylinder walls look 
very clean and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable All 
still within factory specs The only thing I could find however was a 
slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder the one with the problem 
but it is still way below the wearlimit given in the Clymermanual for 
this bike 
Any syggestions What else could cause my problem Do I have to hone 
the cylinder walls make them a little rougher in a crisscrosspattern in 
order to get better breaking in of my new rings Won't that increase the 
wear of my pistons
Please send comments to

  I am selling my trusty Husky hopefully to buy a Husaberg  This is
  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly  I never had
  any problems with it

  It's a four stroke  valves liquid cooled engine It is heavier than 
  a   stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR and has a lot better 
  suspension Ohlins shock Husky fork than the XR For the casual or non
  competitive rider the engine is much better than any two stroke
  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear
  changes
  
  The  ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike
  very easy to start starts of first kick when cold or hot  There is a
  custom made carbonkevlar light  pound wrap around skid plate to protect
  the engine cases and the water pump  The steering angle has been reduced 
  by  degree to increase steering quickness This with the suspension tuneup
  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock Multiple time ISDE rider gives it a better
  ride than most bike plush suspension responsive steering with no head shake

  So if it is such a good bike why sell it Gee I want to buy a Husaberg
  which just a husky but  pounds lighter and a tad more

I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about 
fighting my ticket

Many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your 
case in court  Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge 
about the circumstances surrounding your ticket while one fellow lost
because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness

Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called Fight Your Ticket

The general theme from those who said go for it was to be prepared  
I should do as much research as possible go back and review the scene 
transcribe what happened to tape or paper use any witnesses that may 
have been around have a list of questions to ask the cop andor the judge
and to be positive and assertive  I am innocent until proven guilty gulp

A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed as this might 
trip up the arresting officer he may not show up if the date is on his day
off or if he feelsknows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you

One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness and if he
says I was speeding then by damn I was speeding

Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun

Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all  I'll let you know what
happens after the big day

Sounds pretty lame to me

   For folks who have been to previous 'er rallies at Mariposa 
   Quincy has lots of space all of it flat so room is not a problem

my solution is never to ride next to a car

The only thing between you and them is space
Keep as much as possible

Take this one step further 

Never dillydally in that rear  of either side of a cage  when you pass
make it as POSITIVE as possible and if you can't pass fully at least make
sure that if you attempt it you can make the driver aware of you by at least
getting into his area of vision

This also applies to merging into another lane after making a pass  do it
as POSITIVELY as possible  and what I try to do is look in the rear view
and then over my shoulder  And after I've done that ACCELERATE into the 
lane so that you have a speed cushion should you have missed seeing a 
potential BDI that's trying to do the same thing as you  or worse ie
he may have been behind you saw you made the pass successfully but YOU aren't
GOING FAST ENOUGH to suite him so he tries to go around you on the right

Ride with four eyes

 Last year I believe it was Jeff Deeney posted what I've since come to
 recognize as the ultimate April Fools posting ever  It wasn't particularly
 nice of him as several people were quite fooled and very worried about
 him but I can't fault the effectiveness

Based on numerous inputs most of them unprintable I deemed it time for a
kinder gentler April   Not that I didn't have something really sick and
twisted ready to post   Perhaps next year 

Personally I think JeffyPoo was still smarting more from the third degree
burns he suffered after April st last year rather than the supposed burns
that he suffered in the joke  Granted I was one of those people that were
taken in by it and I was certainly concernedand then pissed at him for 
pulling such a thing which I made known to him

But then again for an April Fool joke I would also go on record as saying
that it was the best orchestrated one I've ever seen and it certainly sucked
a LOT of people into believing it    

sick  twisted Who in this group could ever be accused of such a thing

 Grf Dropped my Shoei RF off the seat of my bike while trying to rock 
it onto it's centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it
 
 So I cheerfully spent  on a bottle of testor's model paint and 
repainted the scratches and chips for  minutes
 
 Then while it was drying I realized that I was out of smokes and that my 
cage is not currently running So I had to take my bike down to the 
store Not wanting to mess up my paint job I said Well heck I can just 
use my old helmet this is your standard el cheapie openface 
  
 I didn't notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei but 
switching back was really bad 
 
  Doesn't fit worth a damn too wide in the sides too short front to 
back
  With a faceplate it's still bloody windy with the shoei I normally 
ignore the face shield until I get up to about ish with this one 
taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind 
 
  
 
 The question for the day is re passenger helmets if you don't know for 
certain who's gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a  church 
meeting yeah that's the ticket What are some guidelines Should I just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or should I 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger

Hello all

On my bike I have hazard lights both front and back turn signals
flash  Since I live in NJ and commute to NYC there are a number of
tolls one must pay on route  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the   seconds to make the transaction
Taking gloves off getting money out of coin changerpocket making
transaction putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and
usually go to another booth

My question is this a goodbad thing to do

Any others tend to do the same

Just curious

   Watch out  Often when some scumbag steals the cover that means
   that they were or are looking to steal the bike  In my case I
   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw RRS that was stashed in an
   apartment carport and not visible from the street  They evidently
   decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing but did try the next night to
   steal a Honda Hurricane  parked in the next apartment building
   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops


I know this is just setting myself up but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes  From all accounts I've
heard practically no one steals BMWs Probably it is similar for Moto
Guzzis and other relative exotics since there isn't a large demand
for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and cc Jap sport bikes

Don't you just hate when the speedo and tach on your

The detailing tip of the week is to use rubbing compound

Moisten a rag apply some rubbing compound and work into the
translucent previously transparent material After a few 
minutes of working on the plastic face the dial or plastic 
face will be clear once more Will not work for glass

A couple of other tips

 Make a habit of parking the bike so that instruments are facing away

OK for a novice question is there anything that will clean a
faceshield and also remove abrasions so that one can see through it
better  

What you want are Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and Plastic
Cleaner They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from
plastic For fine scratches just use the Polish for bigger ones start
with the Cleaner and finish with the Polish The stuff is  bucks per
bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores Don't choke over the
price too much since both bottles will probably last you  years The
stuff works great on plastic watch crystals and compact discs too

Yo did anybody see this run of HARD COPY

I guy on a  Katana got pulled over by the Police I guess for
speeding or something  But just as the cop was about to step
out of the car the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia
Ang then the cop gives chase

Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped
Everything from the dramatic takeoff and mph chase to the sidestreet
battle at about mph  What happened at the end  The guy who is
being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights
slows a couple of times to taunt the cop   After blowing a few stop
signs and making car jump to the side he goes up a dead end street

The Kat although not the latest machine is still a high performance
machine and he slams on the brakes  Of couse we all know that cages
especially the ones with the disco lights can't stop as fast as our
high performance machines  So what happens  The cage plows into the
Kat

Luckily for this dude he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt  But
dude how crazy can you get  Yeah we've all went out and played
cat and mouse with our friends but with a cop  How crazy can
you get  It took just one look at a ZX who tried this crap
to convince me not to try any shit like that  Although the dude
collided with a car head on at  mph the Kawasaki team colors
still looked good  Just a few scratches like no front end
 inch long engine and other minor scratches

If you guys are out there please slow it down  I not being
an advocate for the cages especially the ones that make that 
annoying ass noises but just think  The next time you
punched it whether you have an all mighty ZX or a I can
do it  Ninja just remember a kid could step out at any   
time

Peace  ride kinda safe

sixth gear out of it  He had  miles on it when it was stolen  It was
recovered shortly after that repaired and for all I know it's still going

	The CBC was a shaftdriven overbore version of the CB and was
made for exactly one year yep head and base gaskets are VERY expensive

  Not with a hub cap but one of those Lumber yard delivery
trucks made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road
and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen  gallon cans of
spackle came off at  mph It got real interesting for about
 seconds or so Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
spackle off Me the Helmet and the bike when I got home Thanks 
to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had
a Path to drive through he made with his tires and threw up
the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact A car in

nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 

The messiest time was in San Diego in ' was on my way
back to the apartment in ocean beach on my Sportster and
had just picked up a shake burger n fries from jack in
the box and stuffed em in my foul weather jacket when the
milk shake opened up on Nimitz blvd at  mph nothing

Would anyone out there in DoDland be able to help me out in giving me
a contact to purchase a pair of military airborne combat boots

height boots that use only velcro for enclosure  I have phoned around
and nobody seems to carry such an item  I admit I have not gone into
the deepest bowels of NYC yet for the search but I have made some
calls to several of the bigger armynavy type stores with no luck

 In an article rtarazbigwpi Ramin Taraz wrote

 Does the amount of exhaust allowed to leave the engine through the
 exhaust pipe make that much of a difference the amount of airfuel
 mixture that a cylender sucks in tries to suck in depends on the
 speed of the piston when it goes down 

 and the pressure in the cylinder at the end of the exhaust stroke

 With a poor exhaust system this pressure may be above atmospheric
 With a pipe that scavenges well this may be substantially below
 atmospheric  This effect will vary with rpm depending on the tune of
 the pipe some pipes combined with large valve overlap can actually
 reverse the intake flow and blow mixture out of the carb when outside
 the pipes effective rev range

 Now my question is which one provides more resistence as far as the
 engine is conserned
  resistance that the exhaust provides 
  or the resistance that results from the bike trying to push itself and
   the rider

 Two completely different things  The state of the pipe determines how
 much power the motor can make  The load of the bike determines how
 much power the motor needs to make

have to pay the deductible to get your insurance co's pack of rabid large

I just mailed this

I noticed a in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR
The cut is only about as deep as the tread block and looks like it
only scratched the rubber at the base but the weird thing is it's
way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet
My questions are
 How dangerous is this should I replace the tire right away
and
 If I should since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the
tire only has about  mi on it what do you think my chances of
getting it replaced under warranty are

To the nedod mailing list and Jack Tavares suggested I check out
how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced  Does
anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy

Thanks

Interesting discussion

I limit myself to one 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm
going to ride And mostly unless the alcohol is something
special fine ale good wine or someone else's vsop I usually
just don't drink any

But then alcohol just isn't really important to me mainly
for financial reasons

At least one of the magazines claims to follow the
aviation guideline of no alcohol whatsoever within
hrs of riding a 'company' bike

Don't remember which mag though it was a few years ago

water from a V source  It was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my
RDB  It worked OK apart from one slight problem we had to keep the revs 
above   Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement

It made for interesting cups of coffee anyhow  We would plot routes that
contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
get the water to boiling point  This is sometimes difficult in England

Good luck on your quest

 I just got to thinking  why don't manufacturers still make bikes with 
turbos
  etc 

Because they add a lot of expense and complexity and make for a less reliable 
and less controllable bike 

As an extreme example the CX Turbo cost as much as a Mike Hailwood Replica 
Ducati

I was attacked by a rabid hubcap once  I was going to work on a Yamaha
 Twin AKA the vibrating tank when I heard a wierd noise off to my
left  I caught a glimpse of something silver headed for my left foot and
jerked it up about a nanosecond before my bike was hit HARD in the left

Rest deleted

Anyone else had this sort of experience

   to check them after collisions  Luckily few are as heavy as the
   one that got you

 SubjectGPz runs like a bitch
    Anyone have a cure for sub zero running probs on a GPz 
 Anything below  revs and the bike wants to cut out all the time
 the recommended cure in the bike mags seems to be to switch off the engine
 for a minute to thaw the icebut this is obviously not mutch of a cure
 mine has had the kawasaki heated carb mod but the problem persists
 i've covered the rad which makes the bike run warmer and moves the problem
 down the temp scale a degree or two
    Has anyone tried a dynojet kit on the  or getting desperate different
 carbs or the fuel injection off the GPz 


Have you talked to Kawasaki maybe they did another version of the upgrade
kit  Got to be worth a phone call  Did you do the carb mod or did you buy it
secondhand from someone who said that it had been done

Is that Orpington in Kent  If so have you heard of the Ogri mailing list
which I run  Its an email list for bikers in the UK and interested parties
available live or as a daily digest  Let me know if you want to subscribe

Searched without luck for a FAQ here  I need a left  Aspencade
mirror and Honda wants  for it  Now if this were another piece
of chrome to replace the black plastic that wings come so liberally
supplied with I might be able to see that silly price but a mirror
is a piece of SAFETY EQUIPMENT The fact that Honda clearly places
concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough
to convince me that this my third wing will likely be my last
In the mean time anyboby have a nonripoff source for a mirror

I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory
advice as traffic laws and their enforcement  Everybody's got an
opinion and is dead certain they are right  Yet acurate information is
extremely difficult to come by  The DMV doesn't know  Cops don't
know  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know  The vehicle code
only tells part of the story  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a
wide variety of ways  And the public at large  I seldom hear any
advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced

If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code
study it and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really
happens  Read Fight Your Ticket too but don't miss the little
section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're
basically screwed

As you may have guessed I'm pretty down on the system here in
California  I've carefully prepared for court bringing witnesses and
revealing serious holes in the officer's story only to be slapped with
the maximum allowable fine plus assessments of over   the
message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying
his own cases

So here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket  Take traffic
school if you can  If it's a serious matter get a lawyer  A lawyer
can present the exact same case as you the difference is the
sentence

meeting yeah that's the ticket What are some guidelines Should I just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or should I 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger 

If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size  If your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws carry a real big
spare you can put a big or small head in a big helmet but not in a
small one

It's quite simple the code is the week and year of manufacture

You're welcome to give any of the ones I have a try  As
for the gargoyles if you want mine you can have 'em  I
think the bridge of my nose holds them too far from my face
Same deal for the two of my friends who tried them For
people who use them with a full face helmet all bets are
off Sorry if they fit you well and took my complaint
personally Yes the Oakleys are much more desirable squid

opinion or I wouldn't have tried them

Oh yeah  at  mph in the quarter is such a slug  Come on when was
the last time you used your s max power peak  I think maybe you should
ride one first before passing judgement there is a lot more than just
maximum acceleration 

I really didn't mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc  
I have to talked to a few Duc owners SS owners in particular who
say that the power is something less than overwhelming  That said
I would love to have a SS  I guess I should have been a bit more
specific  If you have something that weighs that same as the  go 
for the extra cubes  

I think that fact that I own a GTV shows that I don't care about maximum
power it's no slug though to the exclusion of everything else  The note 
and the handling are more important to me  I just bought a Ninja because I 
couldn't afford a Duc

Didn't mean to ruffle any feathers I'll probably be getting a SS next

If we are only talking about stroke I think I can understand exhaust
pulse affect in a stroke the intake valve is closed on the
exhaust stroke and the gas is pushed out by the cyclinder  I guess
there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out
but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the 
canister  Meaning would gases so far down the line the canister
really have an effect on the exhaust stroke  Do the gases really 
compress that much

    For discussion purposes I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses
in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental picture

  Unless an engine is supercharged the pressure available to force
air into the intake tract is atmospheric  At the time the intake
valve is opened the pressure differential available to move air is only
the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after
the exhaust stroke and atmospheric  As the piston decends on the
intake stroke combustion chamber pressure is decreased allowing
atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract  At no time
does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good
vacuum

  At the time of the exhaust valve closing the pressure in the
combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up
to the first major flow restriction the muffler  Note that the volume
of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume
that must flow through the intake because of the temperature
difference and the products of combustion

  In the last  years the Japanese manufacturers have started
paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning in pursuit of almighty
horsepower  At this point in time on highperformance bikes
substitution of an aftermarket freeflow air filter will have almost
zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flows very
well anyway  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make
very little difference unless in general the new exhaust system is
much louder than the stocker

  On older bikes  exhaust backpressure was the dominating factor
If freeflowing air filters were substituted very little difference
was noted unless a freeflowing exhaust system was installed as well

  In general an engine can be visualized as an air pump  At any
given RPM anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it
on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more horsepower
Pumping more air will require recalibration rejetting of the carburetor

Personally I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike  If I get hurt it's my own fault but I don't want to wreck my Katana  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu experiment  I had one beer at  in the evening and had volleyball practice at   I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until   This made



 me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication  You may seem fine but your reactions may be affected such that you'll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind  I greatly enjoy social drinking but for me it just doesn't mix with riding

Max enjoyment

Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB Custom 

As recommended I had the bike compression tested  Compression was
a little low but very even across the four cylinders   psi  They
said that it was tested a little cold so that would explain the low 
numbers around   Does this sound right  Otherwise the bike looked
great  No signs of road rash and no rust  This bike looks great 
It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires  
I am opting for the Metzler ME and ME tires thanks to those 
who posted this other thread  This bike is BIG compared to my other bikes  
 Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX was   I should
be road legal tomorrow  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about 
the transmission and taking my chances

Being a reletively new reader I am quite impressed with all the usefull
info available on this newsgroup  I would ask how to get my own DoD number
but I'll probably be too busy riding

Insurance companies sure seem to go for NoFault coverage  Since the
majority of accidents are the cagers' fault doesn't this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a NoFault system

With a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the
legal costs out of the system  But it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed

Now I am jumping into the middle of this thread so I may not know
what y'all been talking about but I have a few comments

atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract  At no time
does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good

There are a number of other factors that are very important the three
biggest being air velocity air momentum and shock waves
Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside
of stock airboxes on a number of bikes  At a tuned engine rpm the
stacks can greatly increase the speed and thus momentum of the air
rushing in
Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake the momentum of
the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside
long after the piston has begun its compressive upstroke
Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from
escaping out the exzhaust ports  Shock waves are the product of expansion
chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' opening or closing
to the air in motion  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they
design for shock waves

 I just 
 pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or
 should I 
 maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my
 likely 
 passenger 

   My rule of thumb is Don't give rides to people that wear
a bigger helmet than you unless your taste runs that way
or they are familyfriends
Gee  reminds me of a dancer in Hull just over the river 
from Ottowa that I saw a few years ago for her I would a
bought a bigger helmet or even her own bike or anything 
else she wanted

 Would anyone out there in DoDland be able to help me out in giving

 a contact to purchase a pair of military airborne combat boots 
 
 D in size  These boots so I have read here on recmoto are calf
 height boots that use only velcro for enclosure  I have phoned
 around
 and nobody seems to carry such an item  I admit I have not gone
 into
 the deepest bowels of NYC yet for the search but I have made some
 calls to several of the bigger armynavy type stores with no luck
 
 Anyone out there know of a place that does carry such an item as
 well
 as does mail order  Any help would be appreciated
 

 Currently there are no Velcro jump boots as issue in
the military there are two other kinds One is made my
Cochran and sell for  in either the Clothing sales
store or US Cavalry Price match at the Cav store the
second co is also sold but somewhat cheaper in design
Actually they don't care what you wear as long is they
are  eyelets high
There is another boot called a Tankers boot this has
similar construction to a wellington boot except for the
boot shape and has straps that wrap around for tightness
Nice boots

Mark

  k is not too many miles on a VFR  I sold my well maintained
' VFR with k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition
All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
and seals  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
to look at the top end do a compression check etc  He confirmed it was
mint

   As for price  seems a little steep  I bought my ' with k
miles on it a year ago and in absolutely cherry condition for 
There is a bluebook ask your bank or credit union for the going price
I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the  dollar range  They all
said low miles  mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them

   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
it at all  One thing to look for BTW is a soft front end  If my
VFR is any indication at k miles the fork springs were totally shot
Progressive springs  fixed it right up

Good luck

Reading all you folks things to do to illegally parked cars made me
wonder who's going to carry cinder blocks on a bike or is 
ready to do serious damage key carvings etc to a cage  Then I
had an ideachain lube isn't just for chain's anymore  It seems
more reasonable to me no permanent damage but lots of work to get
off  Don't ask me how I know   Use it anywhere the windshield
the door handles in the keyhole etc  What a nasty mood I'm in
It's raining again

  Fuel's a bit cheaper too

every day no matter how much you ride them And if you don't fuel them they

better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than
from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors

This is pretty damned complicated I just make a back off motion with

For those of you who are thinking about fiamms you might also want to think
about airhorns I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from 
Dennis Kirk pg  of the latest catalog on my ' FJ They are rated
at db at  meters I installed them using  gage wire from the battery to
the relay to the compressor to ground My stock horn connectors fit the relay
pins just fine I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor and used
a crimp type battery connector and an inline amp fuseconnector from NAPA
	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front
fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube
frame used to support the front fairing You have to remove the front fairing to
do this but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two
vertical supports just in front of the fuses Depending how tight your fairing
follows the frame you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing
The compressor is about  in diameter and about  long
	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame it is small
so there should be plenty of good places for it
	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to
mount The horns fit inside the front fairingframe and stick out on either side
just in front of the air scoops but behind the turn signals The back of the
horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where
the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame There is just enough
room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance and there are nice
cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into
	The short horn is even with the fairing and the long one sticks out
about an inch or so but it is really not that noticable unless you look
closely They end up pointing down slightly and maybe  degrees from straight
ahead perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you
	If you have any other questions about the mounting email and I can try
to explain better If your bike is not red then you may want to paint them
first
	How do they work you ask They are very very very LOUD They sound
more like a european sports car than a truck but a vast improvement over stock
I have used them at least daily since installing them and the  amp fuse has
not blown yet although the duration of the horn blasts have been short
	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them even though
they know that I have the horns they still jump They are perfect for keeping
the pedestrians on the sidewalk
The bottom line is they work are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to
those stupid lane changing cages as well as take a few years off their lives
and are relatively easy to install on the FJ YMMV

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle The question is
is one of the effect dominant and which one is it The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar

As you point out the experiments would be difficult But we know
enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations
There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over
to begin a turn

	 Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over

	 Contact patch having shifted to one side causing bike to fall over

	 Contact patch being accelerated to the side causing a
	torque which twists the bike over

Take an average bikerider average bike wheel and at speeds of 
 and  mph say calculate how much twist of the bars would be
needed to produce say  degrees of lean in say  seconds by each
effect alone My guess is that at slow speeds  is dominant and at
high speeds  is dominant and at all speeds  contributes not far off
bugger all relatively speaking

By the way a similar problem is this how does a runner who wants to
run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast Is there a running
group where we could start counterfooting arguments and have them
all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners

Better still reverse this sequence then hit the bugger under accelleration
to stabilise yourself I hate things that attack me 
If the dog thinks you have run away it has established dominance over 
these funny noisy sheep things and will attack every bike that comes 
along for the fun of it If you can hurt the bugger it learns that it 
is below bikes in the peck order and you may have saved the life of a 
future biker whose evasive action to avoid the dog might otherwise put 
him under a truck Never avoid a dog for the dog's sake only you're own 

 I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic
to this approach It's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just 
another worthless adversary So remember to wear at least calf height leather
boots  in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your
attacking foot and go for the gusto If that dog doesn't retreat from the
street with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you really
haven't done your bit for all your fellow bikers

This also applies in cages

Sorry I can't go this far A dog against and armored cage just doesn't
seem like a fair fight

If the dog is out of control it is a menace to all road users and no
compunction should be felt if ensuring your safety means the destruction of 
it's After all it is forcing the game not you

after all it is a dog eat dog world

OK  so we've got a hotly contested BMWOA election and some inept

My question is the history of the BMW organization that lead to the
formation of the BMWRA Was there something going on in the OA years
ago that precipitated the formation of two competing owner's groups

Just to stave off flames I'm a relatively new member of both groups
and besides a difference in the slickness of the magazines it seems
the major difference is that the RA guys seem to have more fun

I'm a biker and a doglover

First and foremost I want to mention some common sense  If it's a choice
between injuringkilling a dog or getting yourself injuredkilled there is
only one rational decision  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put
the dog first

Second it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language  How you react
to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game and that you're
playing with him is completely different from how you react to a dog which
has hostile intent

Third it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog  Dogs are social
beasts and recognize a dominationsubmission hierarchy  To a dog there are
two types of fellowcreatures that which he dominates and that which
dominate him  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the
latter class  You are God you are easily angered and your anger is terrible
But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance and may
even on rare occasions dispense a kind word a kind word or even oh joy oh
rapture unforeseen A Dog Bisquit

Now how does that all relate to biking  Well first it's a good idea to
assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a
game and not out of overt hostility  The MSF suggestion is a very good one
when you see the dog coming slow down so he determines a particular place of
interception  Just before you and he reach that spot punch the throttle so
that when he reaches it you're already long gone  Dogs take a few seconds to
react to new input and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a
motorcycle is capable of

With a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures
may be necessary  This is the face off  First  and there is very important
 make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory  Face him off on the
road not on his driveway  If necessary have a large stick rolled up
newspaper etc something the beast will understand is something that will
hurt him  Stand your ground then slowly advance  Your mental attitude is
that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT  The
larger the dog the greater your anger

Dogs will pick up anger just as they can pick up fear  And since you and he
are not on his home territory it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he
is on your territory and that you are prepared to fight to the death

Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory
where there is at least a home advantage  They'll also observe that you are
satisfied by that retreat gesture of submission and thus they have escaped
punishment

The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great
deal to them  The more effective you are at communicating body language the
less you actually have to do  After  years with my  pound beast I've
learned a few tricks I think

I have a problem with the battery on my ' Honda CB NightHawk
Every week or so it is dead and I have to recharge it I ride the bike 
every day the battery is new and the charging system was checked 
thoroughly and it seems fine My suspicion is that it is draining
somewhere 

Do you have any idea about what is causing this problem
Please help since my mechanic and me are clueless

Most people wave or return my wave when I'm on my Harley
Other Harley riders seldom wave back to me when I'm on my
duck Squids don't wave or return waves ever even to each
other from what I can tell

  When we take a hand off the bars we fall down

The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers can't recognize
each other's waves  When you're riding a cruiser you wave
by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand without
first removing that hand from the handlebar  When you're
riding a crotch rocket you lower the left hand to about
ankle level palm forward and call that a wave

Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely
off the handlebar and wave it around so it's easy to tell
when they're waving

In three years of riding in the cities of San Jose
Santa Clara and Sunnyvale I never came into any
conflict with the local police over my lane splitting
habits all three of these cities were listed earlier
as being antisplitting in one way or another  I
can't say whether this was due to luck police
kindness or there not actually being any ordinances
against it in these cities so I continue

 My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
 something I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
 approved method Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target
 then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you This time it
 didn't work because I didn't have time Riding up the hill leading to my
 house I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
 the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
 the Spagthorpe Viking Actually the dog encountered me with intent to
 harm

interesting dog collision story deleted

 What worries me about the accident is this I don't think I could have
 prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was This is not
 necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but I was
 riding around the speed limit I worry about what would have happened if
 it had been a car instead of a dog but I console myself with the
 thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a
 blind driveway at  mph For that matter how many driveways are
 long enough for a car to hit  mph by the end
 
 I eagerly await comment

My driveway and about half my neighbor's driveways are long enough to
do a good  clicks mph for the velocity impaired if we wanted to
Granted I live in the country however I've seen neighbors whip out
of their driveways at the above mentioned  mph quite a bit they
claim they can tell that There's noone on the road for quite a ways
This despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving
a Chev x and twice taking my speed bicycle over the hood of a
car that had pulled out saw me then stopped  Same driver  Same car
About two months apart  

ObMoto  The scary relevant part is that these people and I live on the type
of twisty two lane that we all favor for riding and I know damn well
that they can't see me on my bike not if they couldn't see me in 
my pickup

Sorry I should have been more specific  The  SS ran the quater in

a Pantah based Vtwin was the SL Pantah and it ran a creditable  
  Modern carbs and what not should put the  in the high s at 

BTW FZR s ran mid s and the latest crop of Japanese s will out
run that  It's hard to remember but but a new GOOF will clobber an old

Not too hard to remember I bought a GS new in '  It was

    mile and  horses That wouldn't even make a good 
these days Then again I paid  for it so technology isn't the
only thing that's changed Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS

I guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a

Get the organization to act on it is easy to say but says little
about what one really can and should do  What the organization
actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors
as far as I can see  That's what makes it so important to vote in an
election of officers

if I remember right I heard that in the last election only  of the
members actually cast votes I wonder if the current board and their
friends and relatives make up  of the membership    I certainly
plan on staying with the club long enough to vote and to see the results

It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active in
the state and national arenas not infighting than other MC
organizations  Should we change this  Or just join the other groups
that already are in politics

I wouldn't support the MOA becoming politically active in that sense
the AMA already knows how to do that and I'd rather see the MOA support
the AMA in a manner that the AMA needs I think that more could be
accomplished from one strong front rather than two not neccessarily 
coordinated ones

I first heard it about academic politics but the same thought seems to
apply to the BMWMOA

The politics is so dirty because the stakes are so small

Who cares I get my duesworth from the ads and occasional technical
articles in the News I skip the generally drab articles about someone's
trek across Iowa If some folks get thrilled by the power of the BMWMOA
they deserve whatever thrills their sad lives provide

 Okay DoD'ers here's a goddamn mystery for ya 

Oh goody  I love a puzzle  Watson  The games afoot

 Today I was turning a  degree corner just like on any other day but there
 was a slight difference  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension
 to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
 tangible thunk  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage 

stuff deleted

 Okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   How can you
 rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without
 damaging the thread in the hole   Is this some sort of hitech design thingo

Let me guess  You were making a left turn correct  The edge of the stud
contacting the road caused it to turn and unthread itself  If you had 
been making a right turn it would have tightened the stud

edIf he's not I will  

Hey Ed you didn't give me the chance  Sheesh

The answer is absolutely as Ed so eloquently describes

edPut two riders on identical machines  It's the
edone who knows what he's doing and why that will be faster  It may
edbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is
edthrough trial and error but it is not very effective methodology
edOnly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
                             
edimprove on that technique I hold that this applies to any human
edendeavor

Herein lies the key to this thread

Kindly note the difference in the responses  Ed and I are talking
about knowing riding technique while Mike is arguing knowing the physics
behind it  It is possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
ie push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way without
having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
and such as seen in the parallel thread  That stuff is mainly of interest
to technomotorcycle geeks like the readers of recmotorcycles  
but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning csteering
Mike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction  I know people
who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who Newton was
On the other hand I know very intelligent welleducated people who
think that you steer a motorcycle by either  leaning  steering
a la bicycles or  a combination of  and   Knowledge of physics
doesn't get you squat  knowledge of technique does

 With a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures

  make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory  Face him off on the
 road not on his driveway  If necessary have a large stick rolled up
 newspaper etc something the beast will understand is something that will
 hurt him  Stand your ground then slowly advance  Your mental attitude is
 that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT  The
 larger the dog the greater your anger

This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to
a psychological norm that may not actually apply to a particular dog
I've tried it with some success before but it won't work on a Charlie Manson
dog or one that's really really stupid  A large Irish Setter taught me
this in my yard apparently HIS territory one day  I'm sure he was playing

No wonder bikers have such a horrid reputation

 The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great
 deal to them  The more effective you are at communicating body language the
 less you actually have to do 

I agree completely Unfortunately the majority
of my feelings before I can even start to think
rationally abhout the dog that is trying to kill
me are fear

When there's been a moment to set up like you
said a bit down the road or whatever I've 
never had a problem with dogs

Hi
     I am considering the purchase of a  Honda cc Interceptor for
 CDN about  US  I don't know the mileage on this bike but from
the picture in the 'RV Trader' magazine it looks to be in good shape
Can anybody enlighten me as to whether this is a good purchase  Is it a 
good bike  This will be my first bike  I realize that for a beginner
cc is considered too be a bit too much bike  I have heard from friends
that were once beginners that if they had to start all over again that they
would have started with a bigger bike  One just has to be careful and not
drive outside their skill level 
     I had considered and posted about two weeks ago the purchase of 
cc Yamaha Seca Turbo with  km but I am a little wary now about the
prospect of having to deal with a turbo both on the road and in the shop  I
may still consider this bike the price dropped from  to  CDN but
the Honda seems to be a good bike

Hello all

On my bike I have hazard lights both front and back turn signals
flash  Since I live in NJ and commute to NYC there are a number of
tolls one must pay on route  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the   seconds to make the transaction
Taking gloves off getting money out of coin changerpocket making
transaction putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and
usually go to another booth

My question is this a goodbad thing to do

	This sounds like a VERY good thing to do

Any others tend to do the same

	I will now whenever I don't have my handydandy automatic coin
fetchertoll payer Annette  with me

	Thanks for the tip

 If a large Malmute counts then yes someone has heardand seen such
an irresponsible childish stunt The dog needed assistance straightening
out once on board The owner would lift the front legs of dog and throw
them over the driverpilots shoulders Said dog would get shit eating
grin on its face and away they'd go The dogs ass was firmly planted
on the seat

Can someone tell me what a deltabox frame is and what relation that has
if any to the frame on my Hawk GT  That way next time some guy comes up
to me in some parking lot and sez hey dude nice bike is that a deltabox
frame on there I can say something besides duh er huh

The Yammie Deltabox and the Hawk frame are conceptually similar
but Yammie has a TM on the name The Hawk is a purer 'twin spar' 
frame design investment castings at steering head and swing arm
tied together with aluminum extruded beams The Yammie solution is
a bit more complex

 In states with Nofault autoinsurance this applies You basically insure your

 The point to be made with nofault is the fact that it removes the lawyers from the
 system and lets people get their money faster The removal of lawyers reduces the
 clogs on court system and thus reduces government burdens by not requiring so
 many judges 

 does it work I don't know ask the people of Michigan

No ask the people of New Jersey where the nofault hoax has been
going on for years  Last I heard every state that ever got nofault
insurance saw an increase in rates  I know that's what happened in

Insurance companies sure seem to go for NoFault coverage  Since the
majority of accidents are the cagers' fault doesn't this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a NoFault system

With a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the
legal costs out of the system  But it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed

	Yup  Unfortunately as has been pointed out the cost of insurance
does NOT go down with No Fault  The crappiest drivers make out like bandits
because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for
insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy
drivers  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of
the crappy drivers' actions and that's not fair

	Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of
shit because the rest of us end up paying more

	Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is
also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are
inherently less safe than slower drivers and the NHTSA disproved that two
years ago now

	DON'T BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN
	FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM

	That kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against
If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed
on during the drop the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was
intended to do  Conservative recmoto'ers will recommend that you replace
the helmet  If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately you
should

	HELMETS GO ON THE GROUND ON A TABLE ON A CHAIR ON A SHELF OR ON
	ANY OTHER SURFACE THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY
	WILL NOT EASILY BE KNOCKED DOWN

 On a
waterski bike you turn the handlebars left to lean right just like on
a motorcycle

I don't think this is the case at least not on all jetskis  On my
friend's jetski bars turn left to go left  Anyway all you're doing
there is changing the yaw of the jets so the relationship between
the handlbars and the rearmounted jets is completely arbitrary
simple linkage could make it work either way

so this supports the movethecontactpatchfrombeneaththe
centreofmass theory on how to lean This contradicts the need for
gyroscopic precession to have a countersteering induced lean

It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion
than snow skis  But it has been an amusing digression

 damned near wrecked on the way home one night her vision blocked by

 were assuming by pulling that stunt

not that logic has anything to do with it but
I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving
or something but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car
in a known unsafe condition that would seem to be liable Furthermore they
would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation which is an
additional factor in attributing blame

Anyway stickers on the window are less effective no one has any problem
taking a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker but it's a different
story with that that nice paint job on the door

Yo Whaz up

Earlier I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell  Well
I saw one think that someone said about Show me a team that used Split
fires  Well here's some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the x cages  Well for these guys splitfires
increased performance by increasing TORQUE  They weren't focusing
on horsepower numbers

Now how does this related to us high performance pilots  Well that
depends  Do you pilot a high performance  or cylinder machine
In the case of cylinders splitfires would increase overall torque
but 's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low
So for 's splitfires would not significantly increase power

But what about twins  Many of you  guys laugh at some of us twins
but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for
the hp loss see Doug Polen vs Scott Russell Daytona   However
twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands   So how does this
translate  Increased torque should theoretically help twins make
more power  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods
or anything made just stick 'em in

Now I don't know about all of this and I'm trying to catch up with
somebody about it now but Splitfires should help twins more than
's        

As far as racing teams  Ducati team Fast by Ferraci used
splitfires in the  season this is when they had Jamie James
running for em but I don't know why they stopped since then
Also somebody check to see if they had them in 

Peace

	Am I the only denizen who thinks that the Natural Look is the best
look  The thought of kissing that waxy shit smeared all over a woman's lips
is a definite turnoff
So does clear lipstickchapsticketc fit under the natural look or
the waxy shit category  I wear something on my lips to keep them from
drying out  Kissing dry cracked parched lips isn't too fun either

	Not that I'll ever be kissing Beth or Noemi

 in my jacket pocket  Life is so hard  

My wife is looking for a jacket and most of the men's styles she's tried
don't fit too well If they fit the shoulders and arms they're too
tight across the chest or something like that Anyone have any 
suggestions I'm assuming that the VPilot in addition to its handy
storage facilities is a pretty decent fit Is there any company that
makes a reasonable line of women's motorcycling stuff More importantly
does anyone in Boulder or Denver know of a shop that bothers carrying any

I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually fits
HG makes the vpilot jackets mine is a very similar style made
by Just Leather in San Jose I bought one of the last two they
ever made

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy  There is a lot
of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere made of fashion leather
made to fit men etc  I don't know of a shop in your area  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San FranciscoSan Jose
area but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order  Too hard
to tell if it'll fit  Bates custom makes leathers  You might want
to call them they're in LA and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in  Large manufacturers like
BMW and HG sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality but
fit is iffy

A while ago Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing  Don't know what they
finally decided

The other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor I was going only to
the speed limit on nothing more on my bike This guy in his BMW was
driving  meters behind me for  meters and at the next red light I
calmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the
window and I told him he was a total idiot and the reason why

Did I do the right thing

It works for me I avoid obscenities and try to remain calm cool and 
collected and try something like You almost just killed me and I'm not 
moving until you apologize or something more or less benign like that I 
haven't been shot a single time but I don't do it in Texas and I do only 
do it when there are plenty of witnesses around

 The question for the day is re passenger helmets if you don't know for 
certain who's gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a  church 
meeting yeah that's the ticket What are some guidelines Should I just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or should I 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger 

If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size  If your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws carry a real big
spare you can put a big or small head in a big helmet but not in a
small one

  Well you can accomplish both goals actually if you have a definite
physical type in mind when you go to these cough church meetings  If
your tastes tend to smaller more petite cough churchgoers it is more
likely that they will have a smaller head and you can safely get a medium
or small helmet

  This works for me and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend
who at ' tends to look more for women that are over ' and can't
usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had

  Of course if you aren't picky what size cough churchgoers you give
helpful motorcycle rides to then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any
eventuality as far as legality is concerned and a spare handtowel in the
tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport
rather than the padding above the viewport in the cases of extreme mismatch

As such it's somewhat large and overweight for its motor It will

very few other flaws to mention the limited steering lock is the 
annoyance noted by most testers And the mirrors aren't perfect
I haven't gone over  rpm yet still in break in and haven't
had a problem with the SS being too slow  The limited steering
lock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it  The mirrors

 I need help with my ' ZXA I put Supertrapp slipon's on it and
 had the carbs rejetted to match a set of KN filters that replaced
 the stock airbox  

	Ahh and just how were the carbs rejeted to match the changes
you made to the bike A stage three kit from KN or Dynojet

 Now I have a huge flat spot in the carburation at  about  thousand RPM
in most any gear 
	
	Isn't rejetting fun 

 This is especially frustrating
 on the highway the bike likes to cruise at about mph which happens
 to be  RPM in sixth gear  I've had it tuned and this doesn't
 seem to help  I am thinking about new carbs or the injection system
 from a GPz   Does anyone have any suggestions for a fix besides
 restoring it to stock
 

	New CARBS Why would that fix it you still have to get the 
jetting right to match what seems to be a extremely overly lean condition
You added a more free flowing exhaust and then higher flowing filters 
Chances are it's to lean BUT This may not bethat's the big fun with 
carb tuning It's very tricky 

	Your one and only choice unless you want to spend many hours
fiddling with the carbs is to take it to a guy witha  Dyno and have he
tune the carbs for your current set up Otherwise you'll be playing
a guessing game for a long time

The difference of opinion and difference in motorcycling between the sportbike
riders and the cruiserbike riders 

That difference is only in the minds of certain closedminded individuals  I
have had the very best motorcycling times with riders of cruiser 
bikes hi Don Eddie yet I ride anything but

Continuously on this forum and on the street you find quite a difference
between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals

Yes yes yes  Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us  This
is the nature of people and one of the beauties of the sport  

Cruiserbike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
what they like and dislike about motorcycling This is not closedminded 

And what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds a veiw
that of course no sportbike rider could possibly hold  Please quantify your
generalization for us  Careful now you're trying to pigeonhole a WHOLE bunch
of people

That plastic bodywork is useless That torque and an upright riding position is
better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a highrpm
low torque motor

To a cruisermotorcyclist chrome has some importance To sportbike motorcyclists
chrome has very little impact on buying choice

Unless motivated solely by price these are the criteria each rider uses to select
the vehicle of choice 

To ignore these as well as other criteria would be insensitive In other words
no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sportbike rider and a cruiser
rider may havesometimes it's hard for any motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements
  
You're fishing for flames Dave

This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference
between Sportscar owners and luxurycar owners 

This is a moot conversation

I have used this service and have been continually pleased  They usually
only take a few days for the whole thing and you do not have to prepare
the bike in any way other than draining the gas  Not to mention that
it is about  of the normal shipping costs by the time you crate a bike
and ship it with another company you can pay around

Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco
to Seattle  And how much might it cost

I'd recommend that you hop on the back of it and cruise  that's a
really nice ride if you choose your route with any care at all
Shouldn't cost more than about  in gas and maybe a night's motel
bill

enough behind I looked again about  seconds later car still in same

I have plenty of room so I do it accelerating I travel about  mile
staying 
feet off teh bumper of the car ahead and I do a casual mirror check This

nifty little cache on it for things like coins or lipstick  The
new Duc SS doesn't so I'll have to go back to carrying my lipstick
in my jacket pocket  Life is so hard  

	Am I the only denizen who thinks that the Natural Look is the best
look  The thought of kissing that waxy shit smeared all over a woman's lips
is a definite turnoff
So does clear lipstickchapsticketc fit under the natural look or
the waxy shit category  I wear something on my lips to keep them from
drying out  Kissing dry cracked parched lips isn't too fun either

	Agreed but yes chapstick fits under the waxy shit category
although I've noticed that stealing Annette's chapstick after she's
applied it  kept my lips from cracking this past winter like they have
in all previous winters  Sighthe price I must pay

	Not that I'll ever be kissing Beth or Noemi 
Not if Tom has anything to say about it you won't  Noemi speaks for
herself

	So does my darling Annette okay I guess you can ready the
barf bags now

 Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco
 to Seattle  And how much might it cost

I shipped my KS from Portland Oregon to Daytona for this years
bike week I rode it back  The company I used is The Federal Co's
You can reach them at  ex   You either have to be
a AMA member or maybe it is just a discount for AMA not sure
Call AMAJOIN to become an AMA member

The shipping cost is based on the number of miles  It cost me about 
for Portland to Orlando   of that was insurance  All I had to do is
ride it to the shipping dock and siphon the gas out  I think they can
also pick up the bike from any business  The bike arrived ontime at
Orlando  All I had to do was adjust the mirrors and add gas  The bike
was in perfect shape

Riding up the hill leading to my
house I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
the Spagthorpe Viking

	I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking  Was
that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front
fender a style later copied by Indian and the round side covers

accident deleted

What worries me about the accident is this I don't think I could have
prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was This is not
necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but I was
riding around the speed limit

	You can forget this line of reasoning  When an animal
decides to take you there's nothing you can do about it  It has
something to do with their genetics  I was putting along at a
mere mph or so gravel road with few loose rocks on it as in
just like bad concrete and lbs of swinging beef jumped a
fence came out of the ditch and rammed me  When I saw her jump
the fence I went for the gas since she was about  feet ahead
of me but a good forty to the side  Damn cow literally chased me
down and nailed me  No damage to cow a bent case guard and a
severely annoyed rider were the only casualties  If I had my
shotgun I'd still be eating steak  Nope if lbs of cow
can hit me when I'm actively evading forget a much more
manueverable dog  Just run them over

In rural areas flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor

So it looks like I'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage
for a few months starting several months from now and I'm already
contemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again as
possible I have everything under control I think besides the
batteries I know that if I buy a  Battery Tender for each one
and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage
they'll be fine But I'm not sure that's necessary I've never heard
anyone discussing this idea so maybe there's some reason why it isn't
so great But maybe someone can tell me

Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries drain the
electrolyte into separate containers one for each battery seal the
container close up the batteries and leave them that way Then it
would seem that when the bikes come out of storage I could put the
electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully
charged What's wrong with this

On a related but different note for you Bay Area Denizens wasn't
there someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back Who was
it Is there still any of it left

Thanks for any and all help

Sorry I lost the attributions
In most areas drivers are required to show proof of financial 
responsibility which usually means insurance 

Required how  When they get pulled over  Most drivers bellyaching on the
net aside don't get pulled over and checked  The laws are enforceable
only after the fact in which case often somebody is out a lot of money

Don't you have any requirement for yearly plate stickers in the US In
Ontario and Manitoba for sure and the other provinces i think you have
to show proof of insurnace when you renew your plate ie get a new sticker

Yes  Unfortunately there is also the concept that the owner of a car
is not responsible for the actions of any authorized user of the car
That's one of the biggest arguments against photoradar ticketing
systems

You also get to pay all outstanding tickets They even have cross province
agreements at least between Ontario and Quebec so that unpaid tickets in
the other province are on record No having an up to date sticker is a bad

Trouble with that is you then have no recourse if a misissued ticket
or a clerical error on a computer follow you around  The City of Chicago
the informal motto of which being The City the Works issues dozens
of parking tickets each year to people who have never set foot or tire
in the city

 Loud pipes are a biligerent exercise in ego projection

No arguements following just the facts

I was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my
stock Harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention

I instinctively revved my engine before I went for my horn Don't know
why but I did it and it worked Thats rather important

I am not saying the louder the pipes the better My Harley is loud
and it gets me noticed on the road for that reason I personally do
not feel it is to loud If you do well thats to bad welcome to 
America  Home of the Free Land of the Atlanta Braves

If you really want a fine tuned machine like our federal government
to get involved and pass Db restrictions it should be generous
enough so that a move like revving your engine will get you noticed
Sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle Should we
get into how many feet a bike going mph goes in  seconds or
how long it would take me to push my horn button

And aren't you the guy that doesn't even have a bike

water from a V source  It was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my
RDB  It worked OK apart from one slight problem we had to keep the revs 
above   Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement

On my LC RZ to any excolonists I replaced the bolt at the bottom of the barrel
with a tap When I wanted a coffee I could just rev the engine until boiling
and pour out a cup of hot water
I used ethylene glycol as antifreeze rather than methanol as it tastes sweeter

mjsAlso IMHO telling newbies about countersteering is er counterproductive
mjscos it just confuses them I rode around quite happily for  years 
mjsknowing nothing about countersteering I cannot say I ride any differently
mjsnow that I know about it

I interpret this to mean that you're representative of every other
motorcyclist in the world eh Mike  Rather presumptive of you

IMHO  in my humble opinion

leavittcsumdedu Mr Bill writes
leavittThe time to learn countersteering techniques is when you are first
leavittstarting to learn before you develop any bad habits  I rode for
leavittfive years before taking my first course MSF ERC and learning
leavittabout how to countersteer  It's now eight years later and I still
leavitthave to consciously tell myself Don't steer COUNTERsteer  Old
leavitthabits die hard and bad habits even harder

mjsSorry Bill but this is complete bollocks You learned how to countersteer 
mjsthe first time you rode the bike it's natural and intuitive 

Sorry Mike I'm not going to kick over the can you not countersteer
over mph stone  That one's been kicked around enough  For the sake of
argument I'll concede that it's countersteering sake of argument only

mjsMSF did not teach you how to countersteer it only told you what
mjsyou were already doing

And there's no value in that 


I didn't say there was no value  all I said was that it is very confusing
to newbies 

 There's a BIG difference in  knowing
what's happening and how to make it do it especially in the extreme
case of an emergency swerve and  just letting the bike do whatever
it does to make itself turn  Once I knew precisely what was happening
and how to make it do it abruptly and on command my emergency avoidance
abilities improved tenfold not to mention a big improvement in my normal
cornering ability  I am much more proficient knowing how to countersteer
the motorcycle rather than letting the motorcycle steer itself  That is
when I remember to take cognitive command of the bike rather than letting
it run itself through the corners  Whereupon I return to my original
comment  better to learn what's happening right from the start and how
to take charge of it rather than developing the bad habit of merely going
along for the ride

Bill you are kidding yourself here Firstly motorcycles do not steer
themselves  only the rider can do that Secondly it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise


Mike I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural
affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total
waste of time for you assuming your total training hasn't come from
simply from reading recmotorcycles  However  of the motorcyclists
I've discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience
as overwhelmingly positive  This regardless of the amount of experience
they brought into the course ranging from  minutes to  years

Formal training in this country as far as I am aware does not include
countersteering theory  I found out about countersteering about six years ago
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist I didn't believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing and realized he was 
right It's an interesting bit of knowledge and I've had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it who were at first as sceptical as I was But
that's all it is  an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster
or better as a result is absurd

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at
the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn
And that was my original point

Mike

  After both oil changes the oil level was at the top mark in the
window on the lower right side of the motor but I've been noticing
that the oil level seen in the window gradually decreases over the
miles  I'm always checking the window with the bike on level ground
and after it has sat idle for awhile so the oil has a chance to drain
back into the pan  The bike isn't leaking oil any place and I don't
see any smoke coming out of the exhaust

  My owner's manual says the amount of oil corresponding to the
high and low marks in the oil level window is approx  quart  It
looks like my bike has been using about  quarts miles  The
owner's manual also gives a figure for max oil consumption of about
ozmile or Lkm

  My question is whether the degree of oil consumption I'm seeing on
my bike is normal  Have any other K owners seen their oil level
gradually and consistently go down  Should I take the bike in for
work  I'm asking local guys also to get as many data points as I
can  


It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
miles  I don't know why  I've had three new K bikes and all three used a
bit of oil when new  max maybe  quart in first  miles this soon quits
and by the time I had  miles on them the oil consumption was about zero
I've been told that the harder you run the bike within reason the sooner
it stops using any oil

 Once again this morning I pulled up to the designated motorcycle
 parking area only to find a cage pulled up behind the bikes 
 If people don't doublepark cars why do they do it to motorcycles
 Never mind that rhetorical question I know why they do it

 What I want to know is what can I do about it  Carry pieces of
 paper that say Don't park your car in the motorcycle area 
 Call the cops  Wait until they emerge from the building and berate
 them until they beg forgiveness  

 Does anyone else have this problem and what do you do about it

 Evie

I don't know if you have a local branch where you are but the preferred method
over here is to 'phone the IRA and tell them about the car and that it 
belongs to an MP who is on a Northern Ireland Government Committee  An hour
or so later and the car is no longer a problem  It's best not to park too 
close to it though

 Okay DoD'ers here's a goddamn mystery for ya 
 
 
 The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent  I'm
 fairly sure it was there before the event  In fact the thread in
 the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something
 having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously  
 
 Okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   How can you
 rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without
 damaging the thread in the hole   

You can't knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying 
the threads  Also part of the stud would still be in the hole 
Therefore the stud was not in the hole before you touched something 
down on that side of the bike

egreeneastsuncom Ed Green  Pixel Cruncher writes


  All of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand
the technique of countersteering

Including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way
through a corner

The underlying physics are a
different matter and need not be taught to beginners 

Agreed

Countersteering
the technique should be taught for only with understanding of the
technique can one develop maximally effective emergency avoidance
manuvers

This is really the only thing we disagree on Maybe we should agree to
disagree I still think  that telling newbies to steer left to turn
to the right is unnecessarily confusing when they'll do it anyway if they
just get on the bike and ride the damn thing


 I know exactly what's happening  It's those other gits that
haven't a clue  


Me too




Understanding the physics of traction is fine  but I cannot see how
detailed theory like that has any place in a motorcyle training course
All you need to know is that maximum traction is obtained with the tyre
just beginning to slide against the road

Then we are in violent disagreement  While what you state is true it
is insufficient to form a traction management policy  Available
traction increases with applied normal force ie traction available to
the front wheel increases as weight shifts under braking forces and
correspondingly decreases at the rear  Thus a technique of applying
both brakes and easing off the rear and increasing pressure on the
front can best be learned with an understanding of weight shift and
available traction

Jeez Ed when you started talking about traction management policies I
thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway
locomotives

The official line here though I do have my doubts about it is that the
front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place In
practice I suspect most people do what you describe

Saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless
advice to a newbie  He has to go out and slide the tire to find out
where that is  It also gives him zero information from which to
develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and
corresponding weight shift develop

If you don't slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not I'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can  but if you want to find the
limits of the machine you have to go beyond them 

In any case for maximum braking if as I suggested you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding then you'll be doing
exactly as you suggest

  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  I turn  in 
about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
till now and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
motorcycle is going to insure I live in Washington DC if that makes
a difference

It depends on the bike Once you've found a bike you're interested in call
some insurance companies for rates Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than
you might think my EX only costs me year in St Louis I'm 

  Any recommendations on what I should buywhere I should look for it

For a first bike I recommend cc's or less And a bike short enough to get
both feet on the ground when you stop
 
The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety
Foundation Rider's Course See a dealer for details In some states completion
of such a course can give you a break on insurance It will also teach you
to ride properly from the beginning so you won't learn any bad habits

Good luck Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have naked or otherwise

I'm very new to motorcycles Haven't even bought one yet I was in the same
position about you How do you learn if you've never ridden

I took a class put on by a group called the Motorcycle Safety Foundation
in California They might have something similar in Washington

Try calling a motorcycle dealer in your area and asking It's a good first 
start on how to ride a motorcycle correctly

No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects

NMMSubject How to act in front of traffic jerks

I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
pumping the pedal You will obviously need a bit of free play in your
brake pedal to do this It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
himherit may mean that something is wrong


  I see one thing wrong with your strategy

Reminds me of a great editorial by Bruce Reeve a couple months ago
in Cycle Canada

He was so pissed off with cops pulling over speeders in dangerous
spots and often blind corners that one day he decided to get
revenge

Cruising on a factory loaner ZZR test bike he noticed a cop 
had pulled over a motorist on an on or off ramp with almost no
shoulder  Being a bright lad he hit his bike's kill switch
just before passing the cop who happened to be bending towards
the offending motorist thereby exposing his glutes to the
passing world

With his ignition system now dead he pumped his throtle two
or three times to fill his exhaust canister's with volatile raw fuel

All it took was a stab at the kill switch to relight the ignition
and send a ' flame in Sargeant Swell's direction

I wonder if any cycle cops read Cycle Canada

	Although I agree with the spirit of the action I do hope that
the rider ponied up the  or so it takes to replace the exhaust system
he just destroyed  The owner's manual explicitly warns against such
behavior for exactly that reason  you can destroy your muflers that way

Ya Fat Chance  The offending rider was a moto journalist  Those
guys can sell hundreds of bikes with one stroke of the pen and
as such get away with murder when it comes to test bikes

One way or the other it was probably worth the early expiration of 
one mufler to see a bone head get his butt baked

That leaves you between  and  depending on the accuracy
of my numbers to buy a used bike get it registered get it
insured and get it running properly I'd say you're cutting

note this is not about the LA or NY Times

A few times a year a funny thing happens the bike engine runs
perfectly  Completely smooth  Not that it runs poorly normally but
on these days it is exceptional  My theory is that the air density
and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete
combustion  Needless to say it puts me in a great mood

The mood lasted for about  miles  Heading north on the 
freeway about a mile or two south of the  my throttle stopped
responding and I was between lanes  Nothing to do but make 
my way over  lanes to the shoulder initially by gliding then
by pushing  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did
not mind stopping for me

Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS 
carb  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws
tight on a bike but I never thought that I had to do that
on the screws inside of a carb  At least it was roadside
fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time

  If I don't end up replacing it in the real near future would I do better 
 to wear my totally nondamaged  face DOTRATED cheapie which doesn't fit 
 as well or keep out the wind as well or wearing the Shoei RF which is a 
 LOT more comfortable keeps the wind out better is quieter but might 
 have some minor damage
 
  Wear the RF  Even after a few drops  paint chips it is FAR better
 than no helmet or a poorly fitting one  I've had many scratches  bangs
 which have been repaired plus I'm still confident of the protection the
 helmet will continue to give me  Only when you actually see depressions
                                    
 or actual cracks using a magnifying glass should you consider replacement

  

This is not good advice  A couple of years I was involved in a lowspeed
getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement  My head helmeted
hit the pavement with a clunk leaving a couple of dings and chips in the
paint at the point of impact but no other visible damage  I called the
helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage  They said that the way a
fiberglass shell works is to first give then delaminate then crack
This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a
wider area  After the fiberglass has done its thing the crushable foam
liner takes care of absorbing hopefully the remaining impact force
They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality delamination
of the glassresin layers can occur with NO visible signs either inside or
outside of the helmet  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they
would inspect it including Xraying  I did so  They sent back the helmet
with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would
compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection
I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim
prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them

The bottom line though is that it appears that a helmets integrity
can be compromised with no visible signs  The only way to know for sure
is to send it back and have it inspected  Note that some helmet
manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not  Another point
to consider when purchasing a lid

Driving While Intoxicated

  Actually I beleive DWI normally means Driving While Impaired rather
than Intoxicated at least it does in the states I've lived in

This was changed here in Louisiana when a girl went to court and won her 
case by claiming to be stoned on pot NOT intoxicated on liquor

  One can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor  drugs
not enough sleep being a total moron  all can impair someone etc  I'm
surprised this got her off the hook  Perhaps DWI in Lousiana is confined
to liquor

Lets just say it is DUI here now

Several years ago while driving a cage a dog darted out at a quiet
intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance
between us so I didn't have to slow down However a nd dog
suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and
the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier

Apparently it was following the st dog Henceforth if a dog
decides to cross the street keep an eye out for a nd dog as
many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs 

I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GLI which
has a pretty loud OEM horn not as good as Fiamms but good enuff
but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of
the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble
getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards I'd
def feel more vulnerable on my ' Trump as that'd be easier
leg chewing target for those mongrels

If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite
complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running
over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO
compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the
ground by said dog and dies from a head injury 

Any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace
running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate

Help  I've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle  This is great
Unfortunately she needs at most a  seat  This is not great  So far
the only thing we've found was an old and unhappylooking KZ

So it's time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there
Anybody know of models old models and used bikes are not a problem
with a  or lower seat  And since she has to make this difficult   
she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser  So there's bonus points
for listing tiny standards

I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through
several months ago  Did anybody keep that list

From article CquwBtquxcsouiucedu by mikehuxcsouiucedu Mike Hollyman
 Hi I have an  CB Custom that I just replaced the cylinder head gasket
 on  Now when I put it back together again it wouldn't idle at all  It was
 only running on  cylinders and it would backfire and spit flames out the
 exhaust on the right side  The exhaust is  MAC  I bought new plugs
 today and it runs very rough and still won't idle  I am quite sure the fine
 tune knobs on the carbs are messed up  I checked the timing it was fine so
 I advanced it a little and that didn't help  
 
 I assume the carbs need to be synched  Can I buy a kit and do this myself
 If so what kit is the best for the price
 
 Any other suggestions
 
	I dont think its the carbs that are out I would suspect that
the cam timing is out  as you say that you had the head off that
would make sense to me

In a previous article exbcsdvaxcsdunsweduau  says

Okay DoD'ers here's a goddamn mystery for ya 

Today I was turning a  degree corner just like on any other day but there
was a slight difference  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension
to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
tangible thunk  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage 
 some deleted

Barry Manor DoD  confused accidental pegscraper


Check the bottom of your pipes Barry  suspect that is what may
have hit  I did the same a few years past  thought it was the
peg but found the bottom of my pipe has made contact  showed a
good sized dent  scratch

 Believe you'd feel the suddent change on your foot if the peg
had bumped  As for the piece missing  contribute that to 
vibration loss

Yep the same thing happened to me on my old Honda  Twinstar

       What does DWI stand for  I thought it was DUI for Driving Under
Influence so here what does W stand for 

Driving While Intoxicated

  Actually I beleive DWI normally means Driving While Impaired rather
than Intoxicated at least it does in the states I've lived in

This was changed here in Louisiana when a girl went to court and won her 
case by claiming to be stoned on pot NOT intoxicated on liquor

  One can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor  drugs
not enough sleep being a total moron  all can impair someone etc  I'm
surprised this got her off the hook  Perhaps DWI in Lousiana is confined
to liquor

NMMThe other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor I was going only to
NMMthe speed limit on nothing more on my bike This guy in his BMW was
NMMdriving  meters behind me for  meters and at the next red light I
NMMcalmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the
NMMwindow and I told him he was a total idiot and the reason why

NMMDid I do the right thing

NMMYours Truly 

NMM                                  Niels Mikkel

Well sounds great to me When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me
I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
pumping the pedal You will obviously need a bit of free play in your
brake pedal to do this It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
himherit may mean that something is wrong

The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light may
change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth or the
occupants may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such
physically on you or your nowparked bike Admittedly the latter is a
slim chance but it would be enough to give me pause

Hello everyone  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please  I don't
have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information

  I only have about  to work with so that would have 
to cover everything bike helmet anything else that I'm too 
ignorant to know I need to buy

  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  I turn  in 
about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
till now and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
motorcycle is going to insure I live in Washington DC if that makes
a difference

  Any recommendations on what I should buywhere I should look for it

  In DC as I imagine it is in every other state OK OK we're not a 
state  we're not bitter  you take the written test first and then
get a learners permit  However I'm wondering how one goes about 
learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a get a liscence
and b not kill oneself  I don't know anyone with a bike who could 
teach me and the most advice I've heard is either do you live near a
field or do you have a friend with a pickup truck the answers to both
of which are NO  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for 
the best  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs
It's still the big city and I'm about a mile from downtown so that 
doesn't seem too viable  Any stories on how you all learned

Thanks for any replies in advance

An apartment complex where I used to live tried this only they put the
thing over the driver's window so they couldn't miss it  A friend
damned near wrecked on the way home one night her vision blocked by
the sticker  I suggested to the manager the ENORMOUS liability they
were assuming by pulling that stunt  She claimed it was the driver who
was at fault for illegally parking in the first place  That would
probably be good for a laugh or two in court before they found her
liable for Serious

Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired
Isn't that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such

Say that's another thing that bugs me  Why don't people scrape their
damn windows  I've seen people driving cars with barely the driver's
half of the windshield cleared  Nothing else cleared  This seems
pretty stupid and isn't there something probably varies state to state
that says a certain percentage of the glass must be clear  Oh well

 Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
 be able to ride a bike properly and safely But by including countersteering
 theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at
 the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn
 And that was my original point
 
 Mike

While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding
I disagree strongly with your original point The point of formal training 
must be to prepare riders for the road Preparedness is in my opinion
to know as much as possible So to exclude some aspects of riding a bike 
in a course is wrong IMHO Now to countersteering in particular
Countersteering is something that must be trained A common reaction among 
new bikers or bicycle riders in an emergency situation is to steer the 
motorcycle like a bicycle As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the
direction opposite to what was intended Needless to say this is dangerous
I have a specific example A rider in a left turn The rider thinks heshe
is to close to the right shoulder of the road and tries to steer the 
motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right 
handle The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road 
A worse scenario The same rider same turn In the middle of the turn
the rider sees a truck coming towards himher The panicking rider tries
to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it

The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency 
situations AND what to do if in one Thus the knowledge and training of
countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course

  Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CBT Are 
there any easy ways to do this ie a slipin bulb replacement
 
  Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my not damn near bright enough 
incandescent beam might be caused by a permalow battery So I went and 
picked up this cheapo Motorcycle battery and charging system tester 
Hook it up to the battery it's got  lights on Very good charge Start 
the engine to test the charging system and it doesn't even REGISTER It's 
supposed to light  or  lights if everything is OK but it stays down at 
the same point as just the battery
 
 My question here is if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up 
how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged I'd think it would be 
darned near dead from supporting my lights etc
 
 Do the ' CBT's have a problem with their charging system Are they 
just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes
 
 Is there an easy fix for this
 
  Happy noise Put  miles on my bike this weekend finally got myass an 
endorsement which is REALLY GOOD because my cage just quit running 
worth a damn and I won't have money to repair it until the first  And 
the weatherman says Bright and Sunny all week  chance of rain on

 One of those morning just getting the coffee in me thoughts
 
 Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just Hey how's it going 
nice to meet you on the road have a good ride
 
  If you're watching for other bikes to wave to it means your attention 
is on the road where it should be and you're more likely to see cages
 
  It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
you're IN a cage This is a Good Thing

    Why not  Ford owns AstonMartin and Jaguar General Motors owns Lotus
  and Vauxhall  Rover is only owned  by Honda
  
  Yes it's a minor blasphemy that US companies would  on the likes of AM
  Jaguar or sob Lotus  It's outright sacrilege for RR to have nonBritish
  ownership  It's a fundamental thing


 I think there is a legal clause in the RR name regardless of who owns it
 it must be a British companyowner  ie BA can sell the company but not
 the name

 kevinhhaslerascomch

I don't believe that BA have anything to do with RR  It's a seperate
company from the RR AeroEngine company  I think that the government
own a stake  Unfortunately they owned a stake of Jaguar too until
they decided to make a quick buck and sold it to Ford  Bastards
This is definitely the ultimate ArthurDaley government

Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS 
carb  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws
tight on a bike but I never thought that I had to do that
on the screws inside of a carb  At least it was roadside
fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time

You better check all the screws in that carb before you suck
one into a jug and munge a piston or valve I've seen it
happen before

I was posting to Altlocksmithing about the best methods for securing 
a motorcycle  I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock
described below  Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock
in the Chicago area

Any other feedback from someone who has used this

Thanks for any info

 Incidentally the best lock I've found for bikes is the Cobra Lock
 It's a cable which is shrouded by an articulated hardened steel sleeve
 The lock itself is cylindrical and the locking pawl engages the joints
 at the articulation points so the chain can be adjusted like handcuffs
 You can't get any leverage on the lock to break it open and the cylinder
 is wellprotected  I wouldn't want to cut one of these without a torch
 andor a vice and heavy duty cutting wheel

Hello everyone  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please  I don't
have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information

  Any stories on how you all learned

I'll tell you my story as an example of what not to do

Early in  I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on
his old Honda CBT  He had taken the MSF beginner's course so I
actually learned some of what I needed to know to ride

I proceeded to buy a beatup Honda CL for  and a  helmet and
rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker  Then I decided to
invest in a fullface helmet first smart move  Sometime around then
I also passed my road test

On May   I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a
mile trip  Entering the town where I lived a rather urban suburb
I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late
skidded the rear tire out and was ejected face upward into the
oncoming lane of traffic  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was
also stopped for the same red light otherwise I might have slid under
a car and been killed

Now this is anecdotal evidence to be sure but I later took the
Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training
could have helped me greatly  In your case the need is even greater
since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff
as I did

So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing  I
wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course unless you
happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until
you're ready to use it

  I only have about  to work with so that would have 
to cover everything bike helmet anything else that I'm too 
ignorant to know I need to buy

While you're waiting to take the course it might take a few weeks in
DC as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston could you
save up some more money to start out right  Say  for riding gear
plus the cost bike plus maybe  guess to a mechanic to make sure
the machine is safe assuming you economize by buying some old beatup
machine from a private individual plus insurance plus registration
and licensing fees plus the course you're looking at maybe  not
including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance

  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  I turn  in 
about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
till now and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
motorcycle is going to insure I live in Washington DC if that makes
a difference

I pay about  insurance now upstate NY but it was closer to 
in Boston more urban for decent insurance including substantial
coverage for liability which you want unless you plan always to be
poor  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area ergo
more expensive

  Any recommendations on what I should buywhere I should look for it

There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle
magazines I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or
recent models might be available  You could probably look through
past issues to size up what used bikes might be available  My first
bike was  years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice
instead  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that
are parked on the street  I basically settled on my present bike by
noticing that there were a lot of highmileage BMW's running around
and they were generally set up the way I wanted

Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting
showrooms  Dealers in the Boston area at least when I was shopping
were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and
quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models hence
cheaper although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales

 No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects

is made of  articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders but unfortunately
professionals can open it rather easily

	 Freeze a link

	 Break frozen link with your favorite method hammers work well

	 Snip through the steel cables which I have on authority are
		frightfully thin with a set of boltcutters

	For the same money you can get a Kryptonite cable lock which is
anywhere from  to  thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish and has a barreltype
locking mechanism  I don't know if it's adjustable but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat
in boltcutter jaws rather than shear  model

	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel
Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute

	FYI I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck

I know of no law either on the books or proposed that bans motorcycles

that sported a No motorcycles allowed sign at the entrance

And there have been public places  Call the AMA and ask for
Jim Bensberg sp or any one else in their Legislative Office
They will recound the many public places that they had to bring
to court to reverse their ban on bikes  That includes everything
from public parks to full cities  There are probably a few fights

where and when you park your bike is the only answer I've spent all my
spare time over the last two weeks landscaping trashing the garden of
my and two friends with bikes new house to accommodate our three bikes in
relative security never underestimate how much room a bike requires to
manouver in a walled area   Anyway since the weekend there are only two
bikes  and no he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock it was too much
hassle to take with him when visiting his parents A minimum wait of 
weeks if they don't decide to investigate for the insurance company
to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin

Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US
but very common in the UK The UK distributor given in the above article
is
	Michael Brandon Ltd
	 Oliver Crescent
	Hawick
	Roxburgh TD BJ
	Tel  

The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required

Don't lose it

So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars Open Budweiser in left 
hand Camel cigarette in the right no feet allowed If I lean and the 
bike turns am I countersteering Is countersteering like benchracing only 
with a taller seat so your feet aren't on the floor

Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive

No

At least that's what I told the NASA rentacop that stopped me
because he swore I was lifting it up

He didn't completely buy the part about water in the carbs either

 Having talked to a couple people about helmets  dropping I'm getting 
about  Don't sweat it  You might think about replacing it and the 
other  DON'T RIDE WITH IT GO WITHOUT A HELMET FIRST
 
 Is there any way to tell if a helmet is damaged structurally I dropped it 
about   feet to cement off my seat chipped the paint Didn't seem to 
screw up the actual shell 

I'd bet the price of the helmet that it's okayFrom  feet
or higher maybe not

 If I don't end up replacing it in the real near future would I do better 
to wear my totally nondamaged  face DOTRATED cheapie which doesn't fit 
as well or keep out the wind as well or wearing the Shoei RF which is a 
LOT more comfortable keeps the wind out better is quieter but might 
have some minor damage

I'd wear the full facer but then I'd be way more worried
about wind blast in the face and inability to hear police
sirens than the helmet being a little damaged


 Also what would you all reccomend as far as good helmets I'm slightly 
disappointed by how badly the shoei has scratched  etc from not being 
bloody careful about it and how little impact it took to chip the paint 
and arguably mess it up period Looking at a really good fullface with 
good venting  wind protection I like the Shoei style kinda like the 
Norton one I saw awhile back too But suspect I'm going to have to get a 
much more expensive helmet if I want to not replace it every time I'm not 
being careful where I set it down

Well my next helmet will be subject to it fitting well an AGV
sukhoi That's just because I like the looks My current one is
a Shoei task and it's getting a little old and I crashed in
it once a couple of years ago no hard impact to headMy hip
took care of that If price was a consideration I'd get
a Kiwi k I hear they are both good and cheap

 Christ I don't treat my HEAD as carefully as I treated the shoei as far as 
tossing it down and I don't have any bruises on it 

Be mildly mildly paranoid about the helmet but don't get
carried away There are people on the net like those  you
mentioned that do not consistently live on our planet

No No No No All I am saying is that you don't even need to tell people the 
technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first
time they try to go round a corner

Some will and others will steer with their tuchuses I don't know how much
the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the
tuchus steerers I was one I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way
and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding after the course
I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem but I only
started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed
offramps and the like was a lot more difficult that it should have been
I knew how it works although that's currently up for debate definitely knew
that it works as I could do it in swerves but only figured it out later
in my normal riding Just a data point I think that it's not a bad idea to
bring the idea up but it's best to let everyone tuchussteer for the first
lesson or two so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry
about proper handlebar technique

countersteering  In fact my Experienced Rider Course instructors
claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike
turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight
around even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite
direction  I admit I've never actually seen this

I have In our beginner course we had passenger training Sometime during
the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student
would take him for a ride If the student did not give the instructor the
you are a sack of potatoes passenger speech the instructor would steer
the bike and make a general nuisance of himself It was amusing to watch
I'm just happy that it didn't happen to me

On the other side of the fence I owned a Bieffe offroad helmet
Took what I would consider a minor fall and had visible damage

ratio was scary  I own Bell Moto now have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact we do this frequently in MX
and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons  My
recommendation is to buy high quality gear  YMMV

When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object there are only four things
to dissipate the energy the immoveable object the helmet shell the helmet
liner the rider's head the rider's ego ok five Assuming that the helmet
head assembly takes the same impact if the shell cracks in one case then in
the other the liner must be dented or the head gets jiggled If it's the
the liner that's dented the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were
cracked it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area If it's the head
that's getting jiggled maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all

       What does DWI stand for  I thought it was DUI for Driving Under

Driving While Intoxicated

This was changed here in Louisiana when a girl went to court and won her

I'm thinking of buying a motorcycle Whenever I tell people
this I usually get an answer like Why do you want to do that
My brother sister cousin knows somebody who had a motorcycle
and now they are brain dead as a result of an accident

So the question I have is HOW DANGEROUS IS RIDING            

It's exactly as dangerous as it looks You're hard to see and have little
protection Keeping out of trouble means knowing your limits keeping your
machine in good shape and being able to predict and make up for every stupid
move that drivers make out there We deal with it because it's fun but
staying alive takes a conscious effort

Well it looks like I'm Fcked for insurance

I had a DWI in  and for the beemer as a rec
vehicle it'll cost me almost  bucks to insureyear

Now what do I do

Sell the bike and the car and start taking the bus That way you can
keep drinking which seems to be where your priorities lay

I expect that enough of us on this list have lost friends because of
driving drunks that our collective sympathy will be somewhat muted

Look guy I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving but if
he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to
lighten up I mean it isn't like most of us haven't had a few
and then ridden or driven home We just didn't get caught
And I can speak for myself and say it will never happen again
but that is beside the point

In answer to the original poster I'd insure whatever vehicle
is cheapest and can get you to and from work and suffer
through it for a few years til your rates drop

And don't drink and drive I had one friend killed by a 
drunk and I was rear ended by one totaling my bike bent
frame and only failing to kill me because I had an eye
on my mirror while I waited at the stoplight

John Stafford 

  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike I had a BMW RRS
that was a wheelie monster Of course it didn't have the initial power
burst to just twist it into the air  I had to pop the clutch I also
had to replace front fork seals a few times as well The fairing is a 
bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
time But let me give you fair warning I trashed the ringpinion gear
in the final drive of my K I assume doing wheelies And this was 
NO cheap fix either There is some kind of slip device in the shaft
to prevent IT from breaking Unfortunately it didn't save the gears

  On the topic of wheelies the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane
do a stoppy or rear wheelie Man he had the rear end on this bike 
up about  feet off the ground at a traffic light I don't recommend these
activities anymore now that I'm an old guy with kids of my own but
it looked damn impressive

  If you can't keep both tires on the ground at least have 'em pointed
in that direction

Hi

I t was very nice out yesterday in the 'burgh so i rode my bike
to my gynecologist appointment When he came in to do the exam
he noticed my helmet sitting on a chair He got excited and picked it up 
and started asking all sorts of questions about bikes and dealers in the 
area and the MSF course Apparently he rode a friends  for a
while years ago and recently the bug to ride caught him again

Needless to say I had never before talked about bikes so much in
such a position if ya know what I mean

  Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just Hey how's it going 
 nice to meet you on the road have a good ride
  
   If you're watching for other bikes to wave to it means your attention 
 is on the road where it should be and you're more likely to see cages
  
   It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
 you're IN a cage This is a Good Thing 


The down side is that when I'm in my cage I have on numerous occasions
slammed my hand into the rolled up window in an effort to wave at
a passing biker  Ow

Another good place for your helmet is your mirror  I kid you not If
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable I doubt I have to mention it but this trick isn't
quite so smart on a GoldWing CBR any GSXR or any bike with
fairingmounted mirrors

I was a little surprised though to find that you had your helmet on
your seat while you were centerstanding your bike I usually leave my
helmet on until my bike is parked if for no other reason than I
wouldn't want my helmet to be on any surface that I was about to start

DSRiding up the hill leading to my
DShouse I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
DSthe Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
DSthe Spagthorpe Viking

DS        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking  Was
DSthat the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front
DSfender a style later copied by Indian and the round side covers

No Not at all The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when
forties fifties when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing
The first iteration the Springer was a boxer twin very similar to Max
Friz's famous design but with an overhead point cam see below for
more on the valvetrain The problem was that the thing had no ground
clearance whatsoever The solution was to curve the cylinder bores so
that the ground clearance was substantially increased


         Springer motor front
                 Viking motor front    

This is roughly the idea except that the bores were gradually curved
around a radius as the pistons were loath to make a sharpangled turn
in the middle of their stroke The engine also had curved connecting
rods to accomodate the stroke

The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary and still
unique overhead cam system Through the use of clever valve timing and
and extrordinarily trick valve linkage only a single cam lobe was
required to drive both overhead valves

Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation which used a
pressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobe
spinning over One side effect that required some rather brutal
engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to
normal the engine's valve timing would be more or less random
resulting in some impressive startup valve damage The solution was a
little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
beast remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to
pressurize the oil system before the car is started the cage however
uses an electric oil pump Wimps

Despite this fix the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner The solution was to run even
higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly This
was feasible because it was a racing engine

With just a single overhead lobe and no pushrodshaftchain towers
because of the hydraulic system the head of the engine came to an
almost perfect point

                    
                      lobe
                   XX   complex linkage not shown due to
 valvestems            complexity
                      
                   
                      piston
                     
                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical
                             it was at about a  degree angle to the
                             ground and this drawing doesn't show the
                             curvature because there was none in the
                             head itself The bore curve would start
                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                             this diagram


The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently pundits of
the day even said sensuously curved cylinders was much like a pair of
finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank Thus the
name

The Vik was a moderately successful racer lightning fast when it
worked but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
technology Eventually it was dumped when Spag finally realized that
racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made The machines
were raced for another year or two by privateers and their fate
approximately six Vikings were made plus one or possibly two
Springers Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and
down that this machine was tooled for production and that as many as
twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line However no modern
record of a production Viking has survived and most motorcycle
historians discount this story

	For the same money you can get a Kryptonite cable lock which is
anywhere from  to  thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish and has a barreltype
locking mechanism  I don't know if it's adjustable but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat
in boltcutter jaws rather than shear  model

	FYI I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck

A word of warning though  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable
locks under the Kryptonite name

When I obtained my second motorcycle I migrated one of my Kryptonite 
Ulocks from my bicycle to the new bike  I then went out shopping for
a new lock for the bicycle

For about the same money  I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock
advantages lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both
Kryptonite name or a cheesy noname Ulock advantages real steel
I chose the Kryptonite cable  After less than a week I took it back in
disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy noname Ulock

First the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite is not covered by
the Kryptonite guarantee and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of
quality and quality assurance  It is just some generic madeinTaiwan cable
lock with the Kryptonite name on it

Secondly the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke  I
don't know if mine was a particularly poor example but it was often
quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage and sometimes
it would seem to engage only to fall open when I went to unlock it

Thirdly the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves
the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the 
dark  I didn't try it obviously but I have my doubts that the 
lock mechanism would stand up to an insert screwdriver and TORQUE
attack

Fourthly the cable was not in my opinion of sufficient thickness to 
deter theft for my piece of crap bicycle that is  All cables suffer the
weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time  If you are patient
you can cut cables with fingernail clippers  Aviation snips would go 
through the cable in well under a minute

I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my  Ninja
This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
read farther than around the block    We'll be riding some twisty 
fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans

This person is  lbs and fairly small so I don't see weight as too much
of a problem but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go
I want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and
I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
turning so she leans with me but what else  Are there traditional
signals for SLOW DOWN or GO FASTER or I HAFTA GO PEE etc

I really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that
she'll want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated

Thanks

No I can't take back what happened

Yes it was stupid

But by reminding me about it all the time you're
neither helping me or yourself so stuff your opinion

Hey man you brought it up  I agree completely driving drunk is really
stupid and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it  But
DWI is endemic in our society  It is a REAL problem  And we as 
motorcyclists can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver  Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident right bloody in front of me and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants as I reported here  Also drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death which raises the
insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly

In my view drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue
but a genuine safety issue  So if YOU bring up the subject on recmoto
admitting having been caught DWI and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences don't expect people to respond with warm wishes

 Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts

 BACKGROUND
 

 The racing listserver boogieEBaysuncom contains discussions 
 devoted to racing and racingrelated topics This is a pretty broad 
 interest group Individuals have a variety of backgrounds motojournalism 
 roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers engineering
 motosports enthusiasts

 The size of the list grows weekly We are currently at a little
 over one hundred and eightyfive members with contributors from
 New Zealand Australia Germany France England Canada
 Finland Switzerland and the United States

 The list was formed October  in response to a perceived need 
 to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of 
 performance roadracing and to improve on the very low signaltonoise 
 ratio found in recmotorcycles Anyone is free to join

 Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to 
 issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be flamefree

 BOUNCES
 

 Because I haven't had the time or the inclination to replace
 the list distribution mechanism we still have a problem with
 bounces returning to the poster of a message Occasionally
 sites or users go offline either leaving their place of

 bounces from the race list Check the headers carefully and
 if you find that the bounce originated at Sun from whence I
 administer this list contact me through my administration

Hi folks		

Recently saw one post about KREME being a bad idea but that was only	
one man's opinion  	

Any one else have any experience with the stuff	



On my  sporty I had some pinhole leaks open up on the back seam  I kreme
it about a year ago and have had no problems at all  Be real careful as
the cleaning part of the solution is hell on paint

 How about someone letting me know MOTORCYCLE DETAILING TIP  
 
 The far side of my instrument panel was scuffed when the previous owner
 dumped the bike Same is true for one of the turn signals
 
 Both of the scuffed areas are black plastic
 
 I recall reading somewhere that there was some plastic compound you could coat
 the scuffed areas with then rub it down ending with a nice smooth shiny 
 finish 
 

In the May ' Motorcyclist pg  someone writes in and recomends using
rubberized undercoating for this

Hey Ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse's reins
left to go left    Or am I confusing two threads here

Three actually  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before

Basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and
neckrein  Plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and
you pull in the direction you wish to go  Neckreining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go  When training a
plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks  Thus when neckreining to the left the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit
which the horse is used to from his plowreining days

Are you sorry you asked yet

   Request for opinions	

   Which is better  a onepiece Aerostitch or a twopiece Aerostitch


   We're looking for more than Well the pc is more versatile but the 
   pc is better protection	

   Thanks in advance
   Nadine


What is best Books have been written on that But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size shape and needs
If you upper and lower body are not proportional according to aero
dimensions then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the  piece suit I have the  piece suit and I am very happy with it
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the  and  piece suits is almost negligible I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference One thing that is nice about the  piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while still with jacket
you can just detach and stow the pants 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women with standard suits Supposedly for smaller women and
petite men for that matter the  piece will fit better 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them I wish I
got  inches added to my pant legs I find the Long suits are not
really that long I can't imagine how short the standard suits must
be

 An apartment complex where I used to live tried this only they put the
 thing over the driver's window so they couldn't miss it 

I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving
or something but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car
in a known unsafe condition that would seem to be liable 

An effort was made to remove the sticker  It came to pieces leaving
most of it firmly attached to the window  It was dark and around
 pm  The sticker before being mangled in an ineffective attempt
to be torn off warned the car would be towed if not removed  A
reasonable person would arguably have driven the car  Had an
accident occured I don't think my friend's attorney would have much
trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement

As a practical matter even without a conviction the cost and
inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable

As a moral matter it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so
paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker BTW it
wasn't somebody's spot it was residentonly but unassigned
parking

I can file a complaint about this And actually have the chance to have
something done How Who Where

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime
That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
want one you are still innocent until proven guilty  Cops are not the
only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes anyone who
witnesses a crime can do so

Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation give them a
description of the car and the license number and tell them the
specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
ie search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy  Fill
out the ticket and sign it  It will go through the same system any
ticket a cop writes goes through  If contested you will have to
appear in court to prosecute  Your word will not carry the same weight
as a cop's

I was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my
stock Harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention

Sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle Should we
get into how many feet a bike going mph goes in  seconds or
how long it would take me to push my horn button

If we do I think you'd loose  Sure you're hand's already on the
throttle  And your thumb is already near the horn button  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch or accelerating  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push and the second ain't too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead  Besides the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine which is what they expect to hear you are
on the road

As is usually the case a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure

The answer is  feet

 very interesting yawn stuff deleted because I'm like that 

 Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
 be able to ride a bike properly and safely But by including countersteering
 theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at
 the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn
 And that was my original point

 Mike


I am in complete concordance with you there Mike  I was a Silver StarRider
instructor for a while  I learn't about countersteering last year
and I have been riding bikes since   We were never told about
countersteering when being taught to instruct  It doesn't seem to have
affected me or my friends or pupils  We just rode in blissful ignorance

development Propylene Glycol probably the finest radiator

it has a boiling point of  degrees much higher than
conventional coolants which helps elminate detonation and

Secondly it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise

If he's not I will  Put two riders on identical machines  It's the
one who knows what he's doing and why that will be faster  It may
be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is
through trial and error but it is not very effective methodology
Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
improve on that technique I hold that this applies to any human
endeavor

that's all it is  an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster
or better as a result is absurd

Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd
Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
decrease available traction  Braking

It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques  For most
of his riding life this may not be a problem but in an emergency
situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage

But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at
the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn

I disagree  The existance and immense success of riding courses which
teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
that is neither confusing nor detracts from any other aspects of the
course

And that was my original point

Perhaps but in the ensuing discussion you strayed far from that
point to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
rider's ability  I find this assertion ludicrous

 If I remember correctly the reason that BMW's come with those expensive
 and relatively worthless short lived Varda batteries is 'cause BMW owns
 a controling interest in that battery Manufacturer                 

 What's wrong with the BMW battery I've never had problems and I know
 numerous people that are still using the original battery in there
  year old beemers

THe original battery in an  year old BMW may be fine  Mine lasted many
years  The replacement AH battery from BMW was a disaster  The mechanic
from Comp Acc told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a
new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have
problems to bring it back and they'd do it again  It seems that many of
those AH batteries were DOA nearDOA and always unlikely to be going
strong by the end of the warantee period on them  THere was a big batch of
bad ones and they replaced them with you guessed it  more bad ones  BMW
switched to a AH battery that has more cold cranking amps even if it has
less total juice  

I switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one
third fewer dollars

Now the bike is off warranty I finally replaced the stock items on my
Softail Custom with the title ones Installation was pretty easy in
both cases even for a fairly nonmechanical chemist type dude like me
 I discovered the limitations of my tool collection but had fun buying
and making the requisite tools

MC Ignitions Power Arc II Single Fire Ignition easy to install but
read the wiring diagram carefully  Setting the static timing was a
piece of cake  Once installed I have found easier starting smoother
idle and more power plus a more satisfying to me bass note in the
exhaust registera lovely whompawhompawhompa idle  
The folks at MC Ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions on
the phone a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product

SS Super E Carb installation easy once I hacked down an Allen wrench
to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts Tunes like
a dream just like they say  The stock carb nonadjustable was so
lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes and even
backfiring into the intake manifold The Super E is terrific no
hesitation in any gear and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no
need to rejet from the factory settings

I know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchers
out there but I had my bike in so many pieces this weekend I began to
get worried But it all went back together again and runs like a
dream so I am feeling pretty happy

Now all I have to do is install my BUB pipes and try to pass the NH

As I won't be able to make the Joust this summer Job related time 
conflict '    I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in 
Knoxville

I'll be leaving from Chicago and generally plan on going down along
the IndianaIllinois border into Kentucky and then Tennessee  I would 
be very interested in hearing suggestions of roadsroutesareas that 
you would consider must ride while on the way to Knoxville

I can leave as early as  and need to arrive in Knoxville by PM
on   That leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on 
the way

By the way if anyone else is going and would like to partner for the 
ride down let me know  I'll be heading east afterward to visit family 
but sure don't mind company on the ride down to the Rally  Depending on 
weather et al my plan is motellingtenting thru the trip

From the Rally I'll be heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway then jogging
into West Va I to run up   Marlington   Petersburg 
E  IIE  After this point the route is presently undetermined
into Pennsylvania New York and back to Chicago by   Suggestions 
for these areas would be of great interest also

Ryan Another good place for your helmet is your mirror  I kid you not

This is very bad advice  Helmets have two major impact absorbing
layers a hard outer shell and a closedcell foam impact layer
Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
compacts over time long before the outer shell is damaged or
delaminates from age  Dr Hurt tested helmets for many years
following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
up to  of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression  I have
a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail

Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors sissy bars and
other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender  Even when the
comfort liner is unaffected dents and holes in the foam can seriously
degrade the effectiveness of a helmet  If you are in the habit of
parking your lid on the mirrors I suggest you look under the
comfort liner at the condition of the foam  If it is significantly
damaged or missing  replace the helmet

So the question I have is HOW DANGEROUS IS RIDING            

Tough question  more dangerous than driving a car and far more
dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the 
activity  Basically stupidity will get you hurtkilled a lot
faster on a motorcycle than in a car  But with care it is
not unreasonably dangerous  Also buying good protective
clothing is helpful that way if something does go wrong
you are likely to be less severely injured

First thing if possible take a MSF driver training course
this will get you started on the right foot  they teach
control of the vehicle and safe riding practices

Second buy protective gear  At minimum a good helmet
and a pair of leather gloves are a must  A good sturdy 
piece of footgear is also very helpful though leather hiking
boots a pair of old army boots or something similar works fine
for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay 
tied  After those a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps
are nice as well but these are also expensive items  For the
pants many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable
preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight  Similarly for
a jacket a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise though
more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants  Another
thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a secondhand
leather jacket  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items

Third don't do anything stupid  don't ride after 
drinking even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement
and balance don't ride in the snow or when conditions
are such that black ice is likely be very careful riding
in the rain  slow way down take corners gingerly 
brake early and gently  try not to ride if you are sick
tired taking any medication with drowsiness warnings or
otherwise not in average shape

With care you should be ok

The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for
a first time rider I don't want to race nor do I want to
ride cross country nor do I want to ride on dirt trails I'll
probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city
streets and freeways The maximum I can spend is about  so
I'll be looking at a used bike

I would suggest mid to late 's japanese midsized standard
Something in  cc range would probably be reasonable  If
you are shorterlighter than average you might want to go as
low as a  cc bike

Possible models 
The Suzuki GS series eg GS GS etc  These are generally
inline  bikes generally dependable except for a tendency to 
weakness in the charging system  Stator andor RegulatorRectifier 
problems  My first bike was a about ' GS it server me well

The Honda Nighthawk series this may also be known as the CB series
I think  eg Honda CB CB etc  This is another series of
standard motorcycles  Also fairly dependable

Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes but I don't know
them as well

For mid to late 's models of the above you should be able to
buy the bike for under  leaving you money for protective 
clothing and insurance and licensing costs

Hope this helps

   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my  Ninja
   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
   read farther than around the block    We'll be riding some twisty 
   fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans

I'd say this is a very bad idea  you should start out with something
much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head
That particular road requires full concentration  not the sort of
thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time

Once you both decide that you like riding together and want to do
something longer and more challenging then go for a hard core road
like MinesMt Hamilton

In any case it's your moral responsibility to make sure that she
has proper gear that fits  especially if you're going sport
riding

Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST  Finally
the th was a Saturday without much rain  In fact it cleared up 
became warm and sunny and the wind died  About three weeks ago I
took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles  for a test ride
They had sold and delivered the demo ST about fifteen hours
before I arrived  And the demo VFR was bikelocked in the showroom 
surrounded by  other bikes and not likely to move soon

Today was different  There were even more bikes   used dirt bikes
 used street bikes  cars and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat
Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot
Some sort of fat bike convention  Shelly and Dave were running one
MSF course each at the same time  One in the classroom and one on
the back lot  Plus there was the usuall free cookout food that
Cycles gives away every weekend in the summer  Hmmm it seemed like
a big moto party

After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C cheif of sales slime
and another  minutes reading and signing a long disclosurelibility
praytogod form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the
parking lot  We went over the the controls I put the tank bag from 
the Hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else
into the left saddlebag   Thats nice   Having helped push the 
ST out to the lot I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of
the road away from the  bikes and  people  He rode it like a
bicycle  'It cant be that heavy' I thought

Well I was wrong  As I sat on the ST both feet down all I could 
think was big  Then I put one foot up  Heavy came to mind very
quickly  With Cindy on the back  was she on the back  Hard to 
tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat  the bike seemed
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road

By  rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear  Even
on bike with  miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that 
did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and sure  Cycles is
on a section of  that few folks ever ride  About  miles north
of the computer concentration about five miles north of where I
splits away  is a lighly travelled two lane limited access
highway  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton 
ManchesterbytheSea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester
On its way there it meets  a road that winds from the sea about
 miles inland to Andover  On its way it goes through many
thoroughly New England spots  Perfect if slow sport touring sections

Cindy has no difficulty with speed  rd gear th gear purring along
in top gear  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk  Lane 
changes were a new experience  A big heft is required to move this 
thing  Responds well though   No wallowing or complaint  Behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was
nontrivial  Top gear car passing at mph was nearly effortless
Smooth smooth smooth   Not sure what the v sound reminds me of
but it is pleasant  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless
buzz

The jump on to  caused me to be less than impressed with the
brakes  Its a down hill reversing camber twicereversing radius
decreasing radius turn  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder  
The section of  we were on was tight but too urban  The ST works ok
in this section but it shows its weight  We went by the clam shack
oft featured in Spencer for Hire  a place where you could really 
find Spencer his house was about  miles down   After putting
through traffic for a while we turned and went back to 

About half way through the onramp I yanked Cindy's wrist our singal
for hold on tight  Head check left  time to find redline  Second
gear gives a good shove  Third too  Fourth sees DoD speed with a 
short shift into top  On the way to  we saw no cops and very light
traffic  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new
Well now it had  miles on it so it was ok  Tried some high effort
lane changes some wide sweeping turns  Time to wick it up  I went 
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat  And stayed
there  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering 
I looked down to find an indicated mph  Not bad for up touring

Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit  At the get
off in a mile sign I rolled off the throttle and coasted  I wanted
to readjust to the coming slowness  It was a good idea  there were
several manholesized patches of sand on the exit ramp  Back to the 
slow and heavy behavior  Cycles is about a mile from   I could 
see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off  I managed
to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front  Heavy  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put
the thing on the center stand  I am sure that if I used the side
stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute


My demo opinion  Heavy  Put it on a diet  Smooth comfortable
hardly notices the DoD speed   I'd buy on for about  less than 
list just like it is  Too much  for the bike as it is

I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my  Ninja
This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
read farther than around the block    We'll be riding some twisty 
fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans

	You sonuvabitch  Rub it in why don't you  We have great weather
and great roads here unlike the rest of you putzes in the US  Nyah nyah
nyah

	 for the severely humorimpaired

This person is  lbs and fairly small so I don't see weight as too much
of a problem but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go
I want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and
I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
turning so she leans with me but what else  Are there traditional
signals for SLOW DOWN or GO FASTER or I HAFTA GO PEE etc

	You'll likely not notice her weight too much  A piece of advice
for you  don't be abrupt with the throttle  No wheelies accelerate a
wee bit more slowly than usual  Consciously worry about spitting her off
the back  It's as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers
and I guarantee she'll be put off by the bike ripping out from under her
when you whack it open  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time
out too  You and her need to learn each other's body English  She needs
to learn what your idea is about how to take the turn and you need to
learn her idea of shit  Don't crash now so you don't work at cross
purposes while leaned over  You can work up to more aggressive riding over
time

	A very important thing  tell her to put her hand against the tank
when you brakethis could save you some severely crushed cookies

Have fun

GSE  It's a great bike but you'd better be damn careful  
I got a  as my third motorcycle 
deleta
The bike is light for it's size I think it's  pounds but heavy for a
beginner bike

Heavy for a beginner bike it is  pounds it isn't except maybe in
some adman's dream  With a full tank it's in the area of  lbs
depending on year etc

You're '  you should have no problem physically managing
it  The seat is roughly akin to a plasticcoated by  Very firm to very
painful depending upon time in the saddle

The  and ' versions had a much better seat IMO

The bike suffers from the infamous Suzuki regulator problem  I have so far
avoided forking out the roughly  for the Suzuki part by kludging in
different Honda regulatorrectifier units from junkyards  The charging system
consistently overcharges the battery  I have to refill it nearly weekly
This in itself is not so bad but battery access is gained only after removing
the seat the tank and the airbox

My regulator lasted over  miles and didn't overcharge the battery
The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though
tending to melt their insulation  I suspect they were underspecified
it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air

Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal
After you learn the drill it's pretty straightforward


replacement parts like all Suzuki parts are outrageously expensive

Having bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles
I'll offer a grain of salt to be taken with Dale's assessment


Good luck and be careful

	Also I think someone already said this make sure your passenger

	won't let passengers do it What I do to myself I can handle but
	I wouldn't want to hurt anyone else so I don't let them on without

I really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that
she'll want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated

	Go real easy It's amazing how solid a grip you have on the
	handle bars that your passenger does not Don't make her feel like
	she's going to slide off the back and snappy turns for you are
	sickening lurches for her In general it feels much less controlled

I've tried to be rational 
to look the other way

its uncontrollable

I hate pre's motorcycles

At first I thought it was a phase  I though I would
get used to them  It didn't happen  I tried gazing
at CBs and  customs but each time I sadistically
pictured them being hurled off of large precipice
I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and
taking holiday snaps but I can't figure that part out

What am I to do  Everytime I read a sig containing 
some spoked wheel wonder I shudder and feel pity that
the poor soul has suffered enough  I imagine the owner
scrapping out his or her living in a discarded Maytag
refridgerator box tucked in next to their CX

I'm hoping for some deliverance  I had in the past loathed
the Milwaukee machine but I can actually begin to understand
some of the preaching  There must be hope

 My wife is looking for a jacket and most of the men's styles she's tried
 don't fit too well If they fit the shoulders and arms they're too

 suggestions I'm assuming that the VPilot in addition to its handy
 storage facilities is a pretty decent fit Is there any company that
 makes a reasonable line of women's motorcycling stuff More importantly
 does anyone in Boulder or Denver know of a shop that bothers carrying any

There's an article in Motorcycling a couple of months back specifically on  
women's attire for serious and notsoserious riding  They do mention who  
makes stuff specific for women's dimensions and what also works OK enough as  
well  Bates will make custom jackets and leathers for a reasonable charge

Well as a few of you so aptly put it 
get off the road jerk we don't wanna hear your 
whining

Fine

Fuck off too

If you noticed it was in  more than two years ago
and YES I've learned and it's cost me

And yes I've known people friends and relatives who've
been involved in drunkrelated accidents not them they were hit
and my cousin is still recovering

No I can't take back what happened

Yes it was stupid

But by reminding me about it all the time you're
neither helping me or yourself so stuff your opinion

Hey man you brought it up  I agree completely driving drunk is really
stupid and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it  But
DWI is endemic in our society  It is a REAL problem  And we as 
motorcyclists can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver  Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident right bloody in front of me and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants as I reported here  Also drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death which raises the
insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly

In my view drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue
but a genuine safety issue  So if YOU bring up the subject on recmoto
admitting having been caught DWI and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences don't expect people to respond with warm wishes

Dave Svoboda svobodavoidrtsgmotcom     I'm getting tired of

You and the Beav should lighten up esp the Beav  I agree that
DUIDWI is serious  We should have reasonable laws strict
enforcement and tough sentences  But Andrew did not
post looking for sympathy over the consequences  He posted
asking for advice because he had an extremely high quote  His
post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for LESS
He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in
any way drunk driving and has renounced drunk driving  There
are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other BDC
Why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem
an outcast  He has paid his debt to society  Step off the high
horse  We have all been irresponsible in the past

With that said I'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards
rapists  I think it comes because I feel the punishment is not
severe enough  The same may be true of DWIDUI If that is the
case then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to change  If 
we had a reasonable law about DWIDUI with a stiff penalty
then fewer people would do it  

At any rate Andrew as paid his debt as defined by the law
If you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates 
tell your 'representatives'

 I don't fear the thief in the night  Its the one that comes in the

I've got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ and it ain't too good It's
difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tankfairingsidepanel layout
and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches
so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right
If I was buying another I think I'd go for a magnetic one

After reading the service manual for my bike Suzuki GSE I have
a couple of questions I hope you can answer

When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill
cap does one check it with the cap screwed in or not  I am more used to
the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully wiped clean
and reinserted fully then withdrawn and read  The dip stick on my bike
is part of the oil filler cap and has about  inch of threads on it  Do
I remove the cap wipe the stick clean and reinsert it withwithout
screwing it down before reading

The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No B on
the head cover  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material  do
you know of a generic cheaper substitute

My headlight is a Halogen  W bulb  Is there an easy brighter
replacement bulb available  Where should I look for one

As always I very much appreciate your help  The weather in Philadelphia
has finally turned WARM  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes and the riders
ALL waved  A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like

One point not yet mentioned
	Hands on the driver's shoulders are a definite nono  It feels
good for the passenger to stretch her arms and a shoulder massage feels
good too but the shoulders are connected to the arms and the arms to
the handlebars  Should you hit the brakes the pressure on the shoulders
can make steering interesting

Bundle her up if it's cold make sure she has good gear say it again
an pat her thigh to let her know all is great

Good luck		Mike

since at least one other person was interested in this

my FZR's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired
yesterday i bought a can of VHT  degree black header paint and spent an
hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand  sprayed on paint  thought
about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that
i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint worechipped off in a month

soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder
coating while extremely durable will not handle over  degree
temperatures  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with
some new powder that is supposed to handle  degrees but that it wouldn't
be available for months at least  they directed me to another shop that
specializes in header coating

the other shop said they have  coatings available  one is aluminized that
can do  degrees and is comparable to powder coating for durability
the other is silicon i think based and can do  degrees  but is
thinner and not as durable  both coatings have a textured finish not
super smooth and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush

price for  foot header pipes and a foot  collector was   i'm
planning to take the parts up friday and get them back UPS next week maybe
wednesday

sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint
considering how much abuse the pipes get from road craprocks

being a mere female I have often found I can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers so I found a more subtle and nastly
ooops I mean nasty way to get back at them If somebody cuts you up just wait till they have pulled out past you and then gently lean over and
bend their aerial every time I have done that it has eventually snapped
off near the base  which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace

mjsNo No No No All I am saying is that you don't even need to tell people
mjsthe technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first
mjstime they try to go round a corner

karrcscornelledu David Karr writes
karrAre you sure  Remember that you can get around corners without
karrcountersteering  In fact my Experienced Rider Course instructors
karrclaimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike
karrturn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight
karraround even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite
karrdirection  I admit I've never actually seen this

I've experienced this back when I was younger and more foolish

My first bike used to track extremely true  Going down the highway
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest riding
without any hands  If I needed to turn I'd shift my weight into the
turn and lo and behold the bike would turn sans touching the bars
Granted it wouldn't turn very fast but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering

As I've said I know many people who think all you do is lean and any
input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances
possibly for years at a stretch I can't think of anybody who'd argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn regardless of what you want to call it

Except maybe for Mr Sixsmith

Hola amigos

Quiero I need an answer to a pressing question  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both  One is a capable and
smooth street bike low and lightweight with wide power and great
brakes the other is a Beemer GS kind of rough for the city but
great on the long road and backroad  A good start at a stable but
I don't think it's going to work  Unfortunately insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs  

Unless some insurance agent offers a multivehicle discount  They
do this all the time for cars assuming that you're only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time  I don't think I'll ever manage
to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street Turn left
accelerate the Zephyr turn right accelerate the Beemer  Does
anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates  State Farm doesn't

By the way I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes
there and registering them  To ease me of the shock can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR and a RGS  Here in Tucson
they only cost me  full and  liability only for the two
per annum

Muchas gracias

   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my  Ninja
   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
   read farther than around the block    We'll be riding some twisty 
   fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans

Communication  work out your own system  Or just slow down and holler
back every once in a while  At reasonable speeds even on my undermuffled
Magna we can hear each other  It's only above say  MPH that you 
can't really communicate

Balance New passengers are a real pain because you never know how
they're going to react to steering  Some people catch on immediately
and lean with me  Others are completely skittish about the leaning
thing and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon  This is a
pain while turning but manageable  The WORST are the passengers who stay
perpendicular to the horizon then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn
and WHIP AROUND until they're in the correct' position  This always
screws up the line I've picked out

Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers
	 attire helmet long pants bootsheavy shoes jacket
	 Keep feet on pegs at all times unless I say otherwise  Do not
	  get onoff unless I say you can  I've had people try to dismount
	  in traffic just as I'm pulling in to a parking space
	 Muffler gets HOT 'Nuff said
	 We get GOOD traction  We're not going to fall over  Many
	  firsttime riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn
	 Turn dynamics  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and
	  we're going straight  Trust your butt not your eyes  if you're
	  confused close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel
	  of it  Or just hug me tight  
	 Please no sudden moves  shift your weight as desired but be 
	  gradual so I can compensate
	 Your faceplate is yours to openclose as desired
	 Trust is essential  Trust the driver me to do the right 
	  thing  I've driven many miles on this thing and know how
	  to operate it  Enjoy the ride  This is important to
	  stress  For example one of my firsttime passwngers seemed to 
	  watch the speedo like a hawk  I drove her to the beach down  
	  and whever we topped  mph she'd holler SLOW DOWN I'M SCARED 
	  I humored her for a while then simply covered the speedometer with 
	  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster
	  Problem solved  she watched the scenery instead of the
	  instruments and had a much better time  Based on her
	  experience driving a Lincoln Continental she was unwilling to 
	  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike

Usually I'll point out the controls engine transmission brakes 
tires etc and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for firsttimers
Helps calm their nerves and gives the bike a chance to warm up

Watch out for gravel on the Mt Hamilton road  there were lots of little
mudslides after the last big rain by now many of the blind corners will
be nicely covered with a carpet of little round nearly invisible stones
It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner on the 
first trip

Good luck  have fun

out of the question  I am specifically interested in racing bikes CBR

Yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering  Basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left

This sounds suspiciously like black magic to me  If by quick wiggle
to the right you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right
before turning to the left what is the input to the steering
mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old
shoveshove

You could but it would be considerably cheaper to spend  or so on
a trickle charger from KMart Venture or Target then it would be
to replace the halogen lamp power supply after you fuse it trying to
pump current into the battery

While charging the charger should be putting out around  or  volts

I am looking at buying a Dual Sport type motorcycle This is my first
cycle as well I am interested in any experiences people have with
the following motorcycles good or bad

	Honda XRL
	Suzuki DRS
	Suzuki DRES
	Yamaha XT

Most XXX vs YYY articles I have seen in magazines pit the Honda XRL 
against another cycle and the  always comes out shining Is it safe
to assume that the  would be of equal quality

 Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just Hey how's it going 
nice to meet you on the road have a good ride
 
  It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
you're IN a cage This is a Good Thing 

Has anyone while driving a cage ever waved at bikers I get the urge
but I've never actually done it

I've had people in cages wave at me or give me the thumbs up on
occassion  I always return the wave or thumbs up  That never
happened to me until I started riding Harleys so that may have
something to do with it

Why not try waving  What bad could happen

  So in short the  cables seems to be pretty useless I would guess

  The larger cable seems to be a much better unit

  I've got the larger cable  about  inch in diameter actually I think
its larger about  feet long which coils into a  or  inch coil with the
tubular key lock like the Ulocks  It has worked fine for me for two years
now and seems to me anyway that it is very secure  It doesn't have the
weaknesses that the Ulocks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick

 I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my  Ninja
 This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
 read farther than around the block    We'll be riding some twisty 
 fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans
 


An extended ride as a passenger on a  ninja

Owww

Well I hate to be a wet sock but well

I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started
riding myelf and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes  The passenger
seats are not designed for long rides  The passenger positions aren't
even usually designed for short rides  I ended up torturing my knees and my
back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes  One of the
reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
a BMW 

I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first  a short turn in the mountains
or some such  Then see how much pain she's in and proceed from there

The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger

 Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK and work out some sort
  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off  After I get on 
  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready and at the stop
  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off

 Keep your feet on the pegs at all times  Don't wiggle unless your rider
  asks you to 

 The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive  Echo the movements
  and lean of your rider  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable
  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn

 Get used to your rider's shifting style Riders  use a reasonably
  consistent shifting style  Avoid helmet bonk  Helmet bonk is 
  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk hishers  It
  gets old real fast

 When pulling to a stop put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank  Putting your hands
  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain
  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there

 Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be 
  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
  still there   The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider

 Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or
  losing feeling in your feet  Passenger seats are not generally designed 
  for comfort  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand

 Trust is essential  
	We had  bad crash nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest

	able to get the bike slowed down mph before we were highsided
	She got off with a fair case of road rash and I had to have the doc

    Yes it's a minor blasphemy that US companies would  on the likes 
 of AM
    Jaguar or sob Lotus  It's outright sacrilege for RR to have 
 nonBritish
    ownership  It's a fundamental thing

 Lotus looks set for a management buyout GM weren't happy that the Elan was 
 late and too pricey  If they can write off the Elan development costs the may 
 be able to sell them for a sensible price


   I think there is a legal clause in the RR name regardless of who owns it
   it must be a British companyowner  ie BA can sell the company but not
   the name

   kevinhhaslerascomch

  I don't believe that BA have anything to do with RR  It's a seperate

  hello there
  can anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
  comment on its handling 
  
  
     Some guy came to the OMRRA race school last weekend with number plates
     on his VMax  He didn't get more than  practice laps in before he pushed
     the frame too hard and it drove him into the guard rail on the back
     straight
  
     BTW  The rider was conscious and semicoherent when the ambulance
     carted him off  That's all I know
 

 I hate to pick on someone who may have been seriously injured let's hope
 not but semicoherent sounds like a good description of someone who
 shows up at the track w a VMax in the first place

what does that make me for showing up with an old interceptor with worse
brakes and handling due to bent frame than a VMAX  and i didn't even
uh  well i was more than semicoherent when the ambulance  uh

nevermind

When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill

	Most bikes I've seen that use a dipstick rather than a

ok  so what's an exhaust bra  i'm guessing it's not a fabric thing that
straps to the pipes  does it go over the chin fairinglowers in some way

Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
we have all the advantages

I agree with this  After all when you grab under his chin and
are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head what is
he going to do  tailwag you to death I even had one occasion where
I was unexpectedly jumped by a  lb German Shepherd and grabbed
his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other Now I'm
holding his mouth open no way is he strong enough to clamp down
and he can do nothing

HOWEVER all this macho shit aside the fact is that when you are
riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept it may be unwise
for you to stop and try to deal with the dog for the simple fact
that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans
before you can dismount and deal with it properly

By all means if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention
STOP and STAY there If you kick the dog and ride away that is a
victory for the dog  it drove you out of its territory It is not
even a qualified victory it is a victory If you kick it and STOP
and sit there  of dogs will say Oh shit This guy's serious
and back off Now you have established your dominance over the dog
and it probably will not bother you again

Llamas however are a different story If you stop near a llama
it will just hop on and insist on a ride And that's if you're
lucky if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and
steal it

I know there's already a bmw mailing list but since it's an R bike 
only list and limited to the R R bikes as well I believe
I've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is
please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list

there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list that it
be about BMW's I don't care which BMW any and all are welcome I will
probably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter and
would incourage other club members to do the same especially tech
articles

to subscribe to the list send a message to the list address

                    bmwridercactusorg

with the word SUBSCRIBE in caps in the subject of the message having
the word SUBSCRIBE in the subject is the only way to subscribe if you 
put the keyword in the message body your message will go out to everyone
on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief

        your From line must have a valid return address    
        the list sw will use the address in your From line 

if you would like to use a return address other than what is contained
in your From line do not send mail to the list send a note directly to
me joeridercactusorg and I'll take care of it manually

the list sw will hack up the outgoing message From line so that your
original full name in 's is preserved but the return address is
replaced with the mailing list address bmwridercactusorg this 
allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list depending
on your mail interface natch I use elm so that's what I wrote it for 
keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors
parentage

to remove your name from the list send a message to the list address
with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in caps in the subject of the message
having the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject is the only way to remove
your name from the list if you put the keyword in the message body 
your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed 
beyond belief

the list is run from my home system a poor little  box running a
very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix the MTA
isn't the smartest around but I've managed to hack it up enough to make
a decent list MTA additions and removals are handled automatically by
scripts that intercept messages based on the subject see below and
may occassionally goof the sw will send a response message back when you
subscribe if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount
of time my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts send me a 
message joeridercactusorg and I'll look into it

if the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number
of addresses I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up
with a better MTA

good luck

I bought a Yamaha XS with K miles  Over the last  years I've put K
of commute miles onnit  Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every
K  Well every K or so I've checked the pad clearences and they never
change  If anything the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which
makes no sense to me with the pad system  the pads should wear until the
clearances are too great right  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten 
up but I didn't think these kind could

Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for K on this bike and
they are still nice and quiet and if anything the clearances are tighter
What's the deal  Any other Yam triple owners notice extremely long valve
adjustment intervals

 Hi
    I'm now in the market for buying a BMWThe ideal would be an R RS but I'd be
 interested to here of any R for sale Age is not a problem  I'm more
 interested in a good example without a massive amount of miles and one which has
 been well maintained as I intend to keep it well and for some time

    I would also like to know if anyone has any sound advice as regards to
 INSURANCE  yr oldlicence for  yearsno accidentsclaimsconvictionsAm I old
 enough to get BMW owners club insurance yet or will I have to wait until next
 year 

 				Ian

 			Future Beemer Owner


My best advice would be to contact a local dealer see the yellow
pages under Motorcycle Dealers and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet if you can
afford it  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum  Apparently

I'm going to be buying my first bike and I'm considering an 
Honda Ascot FT with less than K miles Does this sound like a
reasonable choice Is there anything special I need to know

An ' FT Ascot was my first bikeI recommend it  If anyone's
interested mine's for sale  It's in LA currently with a bum
starter and around k miles  I'd like a couple hundred for it

On the other side of the fence I owned a Bieffe offroad helmet
Took what I would consider a minor fall and had visible damage
to the shell  Yes the helmet did its job  But the damageimpact
ratio was scary  I own Bell Moto now have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact we do this frequently in MX
and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons  My
recommendation is to buy high quality gear  YMMV

 new Duc SS doesn't so I'll have to go back to carrying my lipstick
 in my jacket pocket  Life is so hard  

My wife is looking for a jacket and most of the men's styles she's tried
don't fit too well If they fit the shoulders and arms they're too
tight across the chest or something like that Anyone have any 
suggestions I'm assuming that the VPilot in addition to its handy
storage facilities is a pretty decent fit Is there any company that
makes a reasonable line of women's motorcycling stuff More importantly
does anyone in Boulder or Denver know of a shop that bothers carrying any

I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually fits
HG makes the vpilot jackets mine is a very similar style made
by Just Leather in San Jose I bought one of the last two they
ever made

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy  There is a lot
of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere made of fashion leather
made to fit men etc  I don't know of a shop in your area  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San FranciscoSan Jose
area but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order  Too hard
to tell if it'll fit  Bates custom makes leathers  You might want
to call them they're in LA and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in  Large manufacturers like
BMW and HG sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality but
fit is iffy

A while ago Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing  Don't know what they
finally decided

I've seen solar battery boosters and they seem to come without any

     Robert Kennedy

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car  I purchased it via
some mail order catalog when the  year old battery in my Oldsmobile would
run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car
Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so I purchased the charger
Believe it or not the thing worked  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car many times after  or  weeks of just
sitting

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasn't strong enough due to its low angle

I think I paid  or  for the charger  There are more powerful more
expensive ones but I purchased the cheapest one I could find

I've never used it on the bike because I have an EZ Charger on it and
keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged

Basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and
neckrein  Plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and
you pull in the direction you wish to go  Neckreining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go  When training a
plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks  Thus when neckreining to the left the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit
which the horse is used to from his plowreining days

I learned when riding bareback as a kid to palmreign by just 
pushing on the right side of the horse's neck with your right palm to turn 
left  a lot like countersteering So that came pretty easy to me in the 
transition to motorcycles It took a while however to break my habit of 
kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster

Do any Honda gurus know if I can replace the 
the front sprocket on my  Honda CBK with a slightly larger one
I see this as being preferable to reducing the size of the rear one

That's a twincam right  There's a steel guard right next to
the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the
engine cases and it's needed  There's probably not enough room
to fit a bigger sprocket

I'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a  ratio
change rather than adding one to the front for about   If you
raise the overall gear ratio too much you'll impair the bike's
rideability because the gears will be far enough apart that
there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at
any given speed  Honda s don't have the widest of power

Hey Ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse's reins
left to go left    Or am I confusing two threads here

Unless they have been taught to neck rein Then the left rein is brought
to bear on the left side of horse's neck to go right

Singletrack snow vehicles with front skis and snow skis attached to
skiers' legs deform the surface of the snow creating their own bank
Ice skates alter the phase of the ice and also carve out their own
tracks
So what 

So they have bugger all to do with motorcycles  Hence any apparent
similarity in handling characteristics may or may not be analagous
in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling
characteristics

OK as one last attempt I'll take a different tack

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle The question is
is one of the effect dominant and which one is it The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar

Let's look at the one that so far has sparked no controversy on its
own gyroscopic precession To examine this alone we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike
through suspension so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way similar to a bikes An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans It 
probably would since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because without the contact patches we can't turn  Maybe there's a 
better way Besides even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it

Looking at the contactpatch effect only however is fairly simple
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle but without rotating wheels
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways and skis or skates would do fine I don't know of any snowski
or skate bikes but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski or something like
that but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect
Now I admit that this is second hand info although I'd love to try
one of these but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle in that you countersteer it to turn
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's
a similar suspension arrangement and no gyroscopes but we do have
countersteering

Conclusion you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcyclelike contact patch arrangements We still don't know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there but from my observations
of how handlebar angle force etc relate to steering in general I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering 

If you don't like this conclusion then don't accept it but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it If someone can prove otherwise go ahead

The other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor I was going only to
the speed limit on nothing more on my bike This guy in his BMW was
driving  meters behind me for  meters and at the next red light I
calmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the
window and I told him he was a total idiot and the reason why

Did I do the right thing

Well I used to get mad and either try to communicate my anger to jerks
or to uhm educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic
Now I just try to get them off my tail

In heavy traffic I slow down a bit mostly so I have more buffer zone in
front to balance the minimal buffer behind but I also often find that the 
jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes switch
into one of them and pass me  which is fine because then I can keep a
better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than
from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors

In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass
I might pull over as if to look for a street number or name
still ignoring the jerk just to get the jerk off my tail  

If this all sounds well wimpy or unDenizenly or pessimistic or perhaps 
for any psych types passiveaggressive consider that I prefer to get
my adrenaline jollies from riding rather than from yelling at jerks  

A ride can improve my whole day while yelling at a jerk is likely for
me to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger  In the worst case
yelling at the jerk could ruin my life  since even a tiny jerk in a
cage behind me is better armed with the cage than I am on a bike 

On the other hand you might try subtly arranging to be the last
vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections leaving the jerk
waiting for cross traffic and thus off your tail or crossing
illegally hopefully in front of the waiting police

Like almost everything here your choices and mileage will vary

 As a new BMW owner I was thinking about signing up for the MOA but 
let my current membership lapse when it's up for renewal
 hints on what will keep the organization in business that long

Become an activist campaign for an MC insurance program for universal
driverrider training before licensing Pick a topic dear to your heart
and get the organization to act on it Barnacles don't move ships

You're obviously not referring to any of the three abovequoted
individuals because barnacles don't each send  to the crew of the
ship to keep it moving

Get the organization to act on it is easy to say but says little
about what one really can and should do  What the organization
actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors
as far as I can see  That's what makes it so important to vote in an
election of officers

It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active in
the state and national arenas not infighting than other MC
organizations  Should we change this  Or just join the other groups
that already are in politics

Incidentally the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at
the moment don't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun
owners  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast
or California and I bet you'll wish you only had to worry about
wearing a helmet  Why does every thread on recmoto eventually come
around to guns

hello there
ican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
comment on its handling 

From CycleWorld magazine  who usually never says anything
bad about any motorcycle

The Max certainly has motor but there are some things it is short of
It is short of chassis  It loves straight lines aimed in one it is
nicely stable  But it is not overfond of corners  Forced into one it
protests shaking its head chattering its front tire grinding its
footpegs and generally making known its preference for straight
pavement  Bumps  It doesn't like them either  Its fork isn't too bad
though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking
The shocks though which work on that shorttravel shaftdrive
swingarm are firm to the point of harshness

   Watch out  Often when some scumbag steals the cover that means
   that they were or are looking to steal the bike  In my case I
   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw RRS that was stashed in an
   apartment carport and not visible from the street  They evidently
   decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing but did try the next night to
   steal a Honda Hurricane  parked in the next apartment building
   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops


I know this is just setting myself up but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes  From all accounts I've
heard practically no one steals BMWs Probably it is similar for Moto
Guzzis and other relative exotics since there isn't a large demand
for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and cc Jap sport bikes 

Well I'd say you're mostly right but for different reasons BTW as of a
couple years ago the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 
GSX's and Ninjas Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that
most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer or mail
order types Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily
by lawenforcement types and their markup is usually sufficient to keep 
them honest about acquiring parts 

For Harleys and ricerockets you've got  different situations There is a
HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts so a bike can be parted out fairly easily
Ditto the nonsport Japanese bikes but the prices on the parts for these are
not as high comparatively For the 'rockets' anytime a bike goes down the 
plastic is usually cracked and is expensive to replace It's fairly easy
then for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike slap it
on a bike in for repair repaint it and make a tidy profit The other parts
more traceable can be used or discarded if they are too traceable

About a year and half ago when I first started riding I took a MSF course I
have taken those lessons to heart  Over the past year I have had only a few 
near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels  Yesterday I got to add
another to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless  I am sitting
at a light about    car lengths behind a car a wise decsion  Suddenly I 
hear screeching tires  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the 
moroon flying up right behind me in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the
bike  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel

I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions

The tachometer has a sticker right on it that says for the first

Well if I were to do that I would never be going over  mph even in
th gear  So my question is will it hurt my new cycle to take it up 
in the  rpm range so that I can at least go the speed limit

But you already can go at the speed limit at  rpm  All you need
to do is to find a road with a  mph speed limit

This isn't quite as silly as it sounds  If you take a nice day trip
over back roads not highways full of people trying seriously to get
from here to there then you might be able to hold  mph comfortably
You could easily do  miles over three different weekends  You
might even get to enjoy some of the scenery  Yes I know this is
probably not why you bought a  called Ninja

thick coat of the carnuba wax on the bike After that those little

Greetings recmotorcyclists

Coming up labour day weekend this year Worldcon World Science Fiction
Convention will be held in San Francisco California  I am planning
to attend and have been speculating on doing my trip there by motorcycle
instead of by plane as was my initial thought 

I live and would be departing from Ottawa Ontario Canada

I had planned to take two weeks for this trip giving me  days travel
time on either side of the weekend

This looks like a distance of about  miles  km

If your distance calc is correct for an on the road distance and not
as the crow flies this is km a day for  days  If you spend the
entire time on interstates which would be a total waste of time that's
at least  hours on the road every day not including eatingpeeing
sightseeing etc

I was contemplating a similar trip but from Ottawa to LA or
maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx  

I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it I'd
have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of
time enjoying the country around me ie stopping with a camera
meeting townspeople going to a few bars  No sense spending  weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump

I estimated I'd need at least  weeks to make the trip worthwhile

I am looking for input opinions comments or snarky remarks on
 My sanity

In question 

 Suggested routes  Note getting there is important and my
   schedule doesn't leave a lot of room for side trips or circuitous
   routes

Try and stay off the interstates

 Anybody who wants to join me on this trip  For even part of the
   distance

Depending on your route and my plans I may be heading that way as far
as at least Detroit

 Anything that comes to mind and that you think might be relevant


Call the Whithorse Pess  They're a book distributer catering to
Motorcyclists  They have a large number of books highlighting
the best roads FOR MOTORCYCLISTS along the general route
you're looking at  They carry listings of bed and breakfasts
all through the States which accept motorcyclists  Order their free
catalog and within you'll probably find books covering absolutely
all you needs for this trip  Their 's in the Motorcyclist andor
Cycle World classifieds

Thanks for any input

When you're on the road in high winds stay alert  Even more alert
than your alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill

wind in sudden gusts well not gusts to somebody standing there but
it's gusty 'cause you ride through it  If you are riding in a steady

gas tank and kiss the triple clamp  Keep a nimble hand on the
steering be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts
Keep a larger than usual buffer zone both ahead and behind and to the
side you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by
countersteering  Keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror if
someone is coming up wanting to pass get out of their way early  Stop
often for short brakes extensive riding in high winds is both mentally
and physically fatiguing

I am having trouble starting keeping running my  CBRF  I have
had problems with it since last year but it seemed to have subsided  Now
it's back again  Problem persists regardless of choke usage pattern
gasoline type brand  octane and pretty much anything else I can imagine
to change  The dealer is stumped it's still under warranty

I start the bike  It runs great for a while  seconds then the engine
starts to slow down  DECREASING the idle setting will INCREASE the engine
speed  INCREASING the choke INCREASES the engine speed  Regardless the
engine will eventually slow down and stop  

Once stopped it will not restart even after flooded engine drill  If
I let it sit  minutes it starts beautifully and runs great for ever
So I go out ride it hard for  miles and bring it back ride it easy 
for a few miles to let it cool down and put it away

Next day I go thru the same drill to get it going

Any ideas  Has anyone seen this before

Another F rider had similiar problems and this is the mail I sent him
hope this helps resolve you problem

   Check the vent tube to the tank Sometimes the tube is clogged or constricted
   This prevents gas from flowing into the carbs because of the vacuum created by
   the displacement of the gasoline This is the small tube on the bottom of the 
   tank the large tube is the overflow You will have to remove the left side
   tail section to get access to this area 
   
   Good Luck
   
 but if it was clogged wouldn't this interfere with engine operation all
 the time  When it runs it runs well 
 
Good point did not catch this in the original post The only other things 
which come to mind since this is a gravity feed fuel system is this
The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the  carburator Let
suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the
vacuum valve in the fuel petcock When it is cold the hole is open enough
to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on 
since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas 
and as the engine and surrounding area warm up the hole seals up 

One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side 
panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs Connect a tube of the 
correct size preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow on the output
side of the fuel petcock Remove the control hose from  carburator Make
sure the tank is full Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum 
to the control hose preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge to check 
for air leaks With vacuum applied fuel should flow freely To see if there is
a vent problem do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed if it 
flows a lot faster with the filler cap open then there may be something in 
the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog 
or partially clog the vent I have heard of some F fuel tanks being replaced 
to fix this problem So the things which might be defective are the control
hose from  carb the petcock valve and possibly the fuel tank vent

Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold then there 
is something in the carbs screwed up but there are so many things to check 
I would be typing all day to list them all 

Here are a few with everything back together apply vacuum to the petcock valve
and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow Open up the
airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs there are
quite a few on each carb

I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting If American
Honda does not resolve this get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and
call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE It is a  number but I don't recall
it off the top of my head I called just about tires for my F and a few days
later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked
the support I received here would be your chance to tell them what you think

Buy the service manual on the F it is an invaluable source of information
for working on your bike and I might add trouble shooting

I bought a Yamaha XS with K miles  Over the last  years I've put K
of commute miles onnit  Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every
K  Well every K or so I've checked the pad clearences and they never
change  If anything the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which
makes no sense to me with the pad system  the pads should wear until the
clearances are too great right  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten 
up but I didn't think these kind could

Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for K on this bike and
they are still nice and quiet and if anything the clearances are tighter
What's the deal  Any other Yam triple owners notice extremely long valve
adjustment intervals

Yeah I had an XS that was the same The valve seats tend to wear 
very slowly and anything that might get taken off the pad which shouldn't
really wear will tend to compensate  so it's a sort of selfcompensating
system

I had the same inconvenience when I bought my EX only I could at least

Despite the high quality of motor oils and motorcycle engines these days
I would follow the instructions and just keep to city street riding for
the first  miles Heck those miles go by fast and it's worth it to
know you haven't possibly screwed up your engine

At the same time this has all the makings of a weeklong thread debating

So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars Open Budweiser in 
David Gibbs replies
Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer
I'll supply one

Yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering  Basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to

I guess I was semiserious Without using my hands I lean and the bike 
turns When leaning a torque is applied at a deg angle to the front 
wheel's axle just as in countersteering However this torque is also about 
deg from the axis of the steering head Instead of making the 
bike lean gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn but I don't remember 
which way

Rick

Oh yeah I tried this in the driveway on the centestandas suggested 
somewhere else but it doesn't seem to work the same

I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
the car in front but enough to manuver around it  Keep the bike in
st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in how's that for
engageddisengaged until there are two cars stopped behind you

When the next BDI cager comes screaching in simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you  You don't need to panic and do it or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine  Do is smoothly just
rapidly  The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection
than anything else particularly empty road

This is maybe not a Pet Peeve but definitely a Playmate Peeve

In article CuxrpFnewscisumnedu wfklynxspaumnedu Bill Ketzeback writes
Any lock including the Kyptonite utypes are EASY to break into if the person has
the proper supplies andor motivation  minutes and your bike is gone
I would be glad to explain but I dont want to contribute to any unlawful
activities 

Does this make anyone's Skeptic Alarm tm go off  No offense Bill I
don't mean to say that you're not being straight but I wonder how you
know about this  Have you actually every used your secret method to break
all the different kinds of bike locks  Or are you taking someone's word
for it

The fact is it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to
go into a successful bikestealing business because they read anything in
recmotorcycles  So please tell us what you are talking about  We can't
even protect against an assault or discuss methods if you don't come out
with it

See I have heard the ones about the pipes and the liquid nitrogen and the
cordless Dremel tools and a bunch of other ones  The most plausable method
I am not a bike thief so I really don't know for certain is just to put
a rod through each wheel and use four guys to just lift the bike into a
truck  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything
Since that method is so childishly easy I figure a nice visible chain or
cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on
to the next bike

Hey finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours  

Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off
by such a trival tactic WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft
the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lockpicker to walk away with your
property  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock
of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned

What tactic are you referring to  If we don't know what you are talking about
we can't very well guard against it can we

For my money literally I rely on a combination of a motiondetector alarm
with pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area CC
insurance and I try to park in obvious visible areas with lots of people
about  See if someone just plays with the bike without intention of
stealing it at least some eyes are on it and if they get too rambunctious
they'll set off the alarm

That's for a nice bike  For a ratbike the trick is to always keep its
actual value well below bluebook so that it looks so crappy nobody would
WANT to steal it and even if they were stupid enough to you would make
a profit on the deal  

Seriously if I for instance need to go on a business trip for a week
and sadly have to leave the bikes sitting they both get a shittylooking
but useable cover locked on and both bikes locked to each other and a
curb bumper in the parking lot under the light  I usually rig the cable
locks I use aircraft cable so that if anyone pulls on either bike or
the cable joining them the Concours alarm goes off  And I have a friend
come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there  The
only thing I have ever had stolen was a  cover and that was over 
winter storage with the battery out of the bike and thus no alarm

Oh put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through and
place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off

That's the best that I can think of  Most of the locks I see people put
on bikes look well not too mechanically sound  I like ABUS since I have
personally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot

 BDC driver nearly rams back of innocent biker
 
 I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
 really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions

Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop  I've only been riding for
about two years but here are my rules for traffic light survival

      I try to never stop just over a hill behind a car  If I have
       to stop in such a location I pull almost completely next to the
       car in front of me  If I'm the only one ie no car in front I
       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane to increase my
       visibility to any oncoming vehicle  Make sure to keep your
       taillight visible to traffic though NOTE  My bike is bright
       white turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial

      On a flat road I stop with a bit of room ahead of me usually
       about two or three bike lengths  This will hopefully give
       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches

      If you are the last in a line of vehicles watch your mirrors
       constantly  If you see a vehicle approaching and can't see
       any evidence to indicate that heshe is slowing down get out
       of the way now

      Flicker your brake light  If I'm the last vehicle in line I
       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from
       behind noticed the car by watching my mirrors of course 
       I vary the speed of the flicker hoping to make the cager notice
       that there's something in the lane ahead of him

Now with all that said it's the situation where you are first in line
that I feel most defenseless  If you're first in line your forward escape
route is seriously limited  you can only move forward to the extent that
you don't enter the intersection  I leave some room behind the stop line
although around here the  light activators are always right up 
next to the stop line and watch the mirrors  I think I've decided
that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation
Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind
you

once while peddaling up a steep hill I lost my right sock but no

complaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect about the dogs
no more dogs no more attacks The telephone worked much better

I have never experienced wind so severe it physically precluded operation

My Kawasaki KZ  L has  millimetres of play on the gearchange
pedal axle in other words I can move the axle sideways  upanddown
for few millimetres to each direction This doesn't bother me when
riding but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt Last summer I took the
bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted and the mechanic mentioned
that it should be an easy job All I would have to do is to remove the
front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find
there Well upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange
axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover It seems that in
addition to removing the cover I would have at least to remove the
sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket

Question  Would removing this small cover from the left side of the
engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushingseal Don't know the
exact term in english sorry 

Question  Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some
other purpose  Does the oil for example stay inside the engine 

Thanks

 The question for the day is re passenger helmets if you don't know for 
certain who's gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a  church 
meeting yeah that's the ticket What are some guidelines Should I just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or should I 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger 

If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size  If your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws carry a real big
spare you can put a big or small head in a big helmet but not in a
small one

While shopping for a passenger helmet I noticed that in many cases the
external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL  The
difference was the amount of inside padding

My solution was to buy a large helmet and construct a removable liner 
from a sheet of  closedcell foam and some satin glued to the inside
surface  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallestheaded pillion
with the liner in and a comfortable fit on my largestheaded pillion with
the liner out  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit

tarp on it

Well now I have to move and want to clean up the   I tried starting it
with someone else's battery and had no luck  My first guess is that it is
the gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas I can only
pray that I didn't trash the carbeurators  The question is what do I do
with this old gas  I am not going to run it in my Sabre and I think that
there is enough that I don't want to burn it campus police don't think
too kindly about bonfires  Dumping it isn't a great idea

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means slow down

Seriously concentrate on being very smooth and you will make her
experience much more enjoyable  Even a normal upshift causes your
passenger to bob so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the
clutch to eliminate this  It's more work but your passenger will
appreciate it  Also I've found that using more rear brake than normal
helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops which
makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on  If you're going
sport riding have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves
against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your
arms  Again your bike will dive less too

Hey what the hell do you mean by that  You suck  I have a godgiven
right to express opinions carry a gun and to not wear a helmet goddamn 
it Everything you stand for is STUPID

I'd give it an  on a scale of  While not mentioning Hitler or
Koresh weighs in your favor you also neglected to mention  mph tennis
balls little girls and countersteering Another thing to consider is
that like Mexican food a lot of folks mistake heat for quality Subtle
references to various personal qualitieshabitsancestrypossesions
generally earn more points than four letter words or the caps lock key
And introducing a new polysyllabic word strabismic for example is
likely to insure that some small part of your flame will become
immortal
 
Blaine Gardner  Evans  Sutherland
bgardnerdsdescom

Aw c'mon  The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points
not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say
The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish

I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames
The first does trade quality'' in the sense you mention for heat
This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly which I
contend was done above is reasonably entertaining  While it is true that
the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity friends
dinner or entertainment it says what it needs to with the appropriate
flair and it is short  The weakness of this type of flame is actually
that it can easily be taken too far at which point it becomes trite and
boring  Witness the Infante thread recently

The other type of flame which you seem to be glorifying above has
a few weaknesses as well  In the first place it can get verbose and 
tedious in the extreme particularly if the reader does not already strongly
identify with one side or the other  In the second discussing someone's
personal qualities habits and so forth can quickly become libelous
Or is that slanderous  I can never remember the difference  This leads
to a proliferation of lawyers which is widely regarded as a BAD THING
Finally introducing polysyllabic words is problematic  I can't haul my
big dic around on my bike and it would be bad form to use a word which
actually turned out to have a meaning especially one which ran counter
to my use and flamage in general

In summary Blaine your score for that flame is incorrect  While it may
be the wunderflame the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
weaknesses and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
applicable  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a
flatulent dog stapled to your posterior and I'll bet you and your 
motorcycle lean to the outside while turning  The same goes for anyone
who looks like you too

 Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human

 I agree with this  
 
 Me too for chihuahua's  The police and the military don't train
 dobermans and shephards and use them as weapons because they are so
 easy for the average Joe to defeat barehanded  You may have opposing
 thumbs but the dog has teeth so effective some of yours are named for
 him  He has IR vision better hearing and better smell than you do
 and most likely faster reflexes
 
 You're on a motorcycle he's on paws  Roll on and blow him off  He
 doesn't even have net access
 
 Oh bull pucky Ed They use dogs because a Many people are
 scared shitless of them and b because of the nose and the
 vision and hearing Without their cop partner in attendance
 the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with
 a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force

Oh horse puckey  Without their cop partner in attendance they are less likely
to be controllable without the use of force which would kill the dog

 
 Those teeth aren't very much good with an arm shoved into the
 back
 of the animals throat and held there and the neck is not

Ok  so you've disabled the dog's mouth and given up use of your arm to do
so  How bout them front and read paws and the fact that to plug up that 
mouth you've given the dog the advantage of balance

 espcially strong neither are the leg joints which can be
 easily snapped or the skull easily crushed on even the largest
 dogs

Have you ever tried to snap leg or crush the skull of a dog without use of 
hardened instruments such as a baseball bat  Without the use of both arms and
full cooperation of the beastie involved it's not that easy  Oh but wait
you've got your arm shoved in the dogs mouth  You lose

 Your advice is correct but a dog is still no match for a trained
 human in a fight

Oh now you qualify you earlier statement by saying a trained human  

 Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
 we have all the advantages

Most people here have not been trained to deal with a dog that wants to maul
you  get a clue

There has been a running thread on the need to understand
countersteering  I have seen a lot of opinion but not much of it has
any basis in fact or study  The bottom line is

The understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among
the accidentinvolved riders in the Hurt study

The average rider does not identify that countersteering alone
provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves
even after many years of practice

I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs But did the Hurt
study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure
to swerve In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen riders
will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare simply because
the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it overrides
everything else Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
manouvres  did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable

I'll second that I saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was 
unwise to buy secondhand  stuff like parachutes toilet paper condoms
and motorcycle helmets

Seriously though why take the risk You are extremely unlikely to get
a goodfitting secondhand helmet cos life just doesn't work like that

 tune knobs on the carbs are messed up  I checked the timing it was fine so

To followup I had a bad experience w a Krypto Lock too

Last year I bought a Krypto Cable II x' long something like that
that by all standards seemed like a decent piece  Until I used it anyway
Before I ever used it for security purposes I used it for entertainment
minds out of the gutter please which is to say that I sat fiddling w
it while watching TV the night I got it  After three minutes of mindless
fiddling of course it was mindless remember I was watching TV the entire
tumbler mechanism came out on the key  Not unlike that old Georgieporgie
nursery rhyme  This left a very empty cylinder and a very nonsecure 
read swingin' in the breeze cable lock
Kinda makes me wonder about any flat keystyle lock  One yank w a 
slidehammer and Viola I'm making an insurance claim

Anyone else have a similar experience w the Kryptos not bike theft

There was an article in one of the UK dailies this week
about a soccer goalkeeper who had to be carried off the
field after a collision with a Ford Sierra cage

Seems the cage driver wanted to turn around but needed to
drive onto the pitch to do this so he waited till the ball
and most of the players were up the other end Unfortunately
as soon as he started his manouvre someone booted the ball back down
the pitch the goalkeeper ran backwards towards his goal straight
into the cage

Yes it was specifically the ability or understanding of the
technique which was absent  We have made a lot of progress between
rider education and responsibility over the last tentwenty years
but I am still amazed anytime I teach an ERC how many people of many
year riding experience discover countersteering for cornering or
swerving

Mike everything else Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
Mike manouvres  did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal
street strategy like SIPDE for example was the most important
component of any rider education curriculum  The specific skills of
emergency braking cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced
as well but more significant was that  of rider did NOTHING
confronted with a potential accident and another third collided or
fell over as a result of rider error  The choice of specific maneuver
is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and
the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure

 Most of the people who made this group interesting  or  years ago

I'm terribly sorry

 Based on your previous postings apparently devoid of humour sarcasm

 assumed you were serious Mea culpa
I know I know Subtlety is sort of you know subtle isn't it

 Still it's nice to see that BNR are doing so well that they can afford

A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger

There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power having taken
passengers very occasionally on the small  etc bikes I used to
ride in the UK it was hard  I'm now riding a GS and that's great
even moving from my freinds GSX I was riding recently This may be due
in part to the fact that neither I nor my regular passengers are
particularly slimline 

I always tell passengers stay in line with the bike on corners that makes
their movements predictable

My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all
I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods
Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers
a friend recently for her first time on a bike who hold on to me real tight
making any kind of maneuvering difficult

I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and
shifts their weight a bit I recently took a work collegue to a meeting about
a  hour ride and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
sitting very still and getting a sore back

We have a code system for turns stop and for 'I need to shift position'

Unable to stand the pain anymore my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter
and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT

It came with no instructions but it came  weeks earlier than they
said it would  Installation would have been very easy but the seat
fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with
the stock seat  It never was easy to put on  Once I figured that
out the new seat went on the first try  The passenger backrest though
does not fit as I thought it might  The supplied screw to set the 
backrest angle does not fit and I have not yet found a suitable 
hard  SAE grade  or perhaps    bolt that fits  There is a
a soft bolt in there now  just don't lean back

The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider  Seems comfortable
enough but then again I put about  miles on the stock seat
without a thought  The passenger's section has about  times the 
volume of foam that the stock seat has and from my short test it
seems much more comfortable  The backrest helps a bit but I've not 
has enough time to really test it  The backrest also comes with a 
small pocket  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 
 taller seat

If I go on the threenotch ride soon  Dixville Pinkham  Smugglers
I'll give a more complete report but in general it seems like an
improvement

Various posts about shafties can't do wheelies

  No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects
  of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift
  off the ground

Good point Johna buddy of mine told me that same thing when I had my
BMW RGS I dumped the clutch at rpm hey ito nly revved to  or so and

 Oh bull pucky Ed They use dogs because a Many people are

 the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with
 a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force

One of the things that police dogs are used for is to
take the bullet instead of the human police officer
As Charles said many people are scared of dogs and will
panic when one goes on attack  They will then turn their 
weapon on the dog and this allows the police officer to
take control

 Your advice is correct but a dog is still no match for a trained
 human in a fight

A single person vs a single dog in a facetoface confrontation should
really be no contest  The dog is no match for a human willing to fight
Multiple dogs is a different story

Sure you didn't rape and pillage It's a relief to know that you were

justify your lesser indescretions  Some pretty distorted thinking I
should say  
Oh I'm sorry I just noticed that you left mucho bucks as in MONEY
Nevermind my criticism I was out of line  I forgot that when one leaves
mucho bucks as in MONEY their behavior is permissable perhaps even 
justified

Keep in mind that themfolks are the ones that could give a  when 
a biker gets killed when their elected officials institute further
draconian legislation helmet laws gun controls etc the ones that don't 
respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all the
rest of the time
Need I continue

So continue to wear your stigma as a badge but the next time you are
whining about them and the effect of their values on yours remember
that it was probably the behavior of selfrighteous wusses like myself
that kept them at bay for this long

 Do they really make a difference during the winter

I just got a K and had the heated grips installed  As far as I can
tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips 
They are not soft  Last weekend I did a  mile roundtrip and
got to a point where it was in the s and raining  Those heated

 A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime
 That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
 want one you are still innocent until proven guilty  Cops are not the
 only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes anyone who
 witnesses a crime can do so
 
 Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation give them a
 description of the car and the license number and tell them the
 specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
 ie search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy  Fill
 out the ticket and sign it  It will go through the same system any
 ticket a cop writes goes through  If contested you will have to
 appear in court to prosecute  Your word will not carry the same weight
 as a cop's
 
 And indeed the advice I got from a police officer when I had my
 close call was that without additional impartial witnesses it
 would be my word vs the other driver's and that it was up to me
 to decide whether the time and inconvenience to me was worth the
 time and inconvenience to the other driver and also whether any
 positive effect would result beyond making me feel better

My  worth I did this once BDI LadyCager in a Town Car passed me on
the right on a two lane road I memorized her license plate this in the
days before I carried pen and paper in my tankbag and went to the local
police station Cops filled out the ticket I signed it She paid it

I think the only thing to watch for is the number of attachment

 It's exactly as dangerous as it looks You're hard to see and have little

Hi

I'm not sure what the other guy can't track down his post for his name
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable
They are  There's a space between each link where the teeth of the 
locking head notch in  Thus each link is a possible locking point

Also and this is not applicable to hardcore thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxyacetylene torches the cobralinks LOOK a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks IMHO and I think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to boredjoyridersnominallyadeptat
crackingunsecuredbike deterrence as long as the lock is nominally 
functional

Finally I notice that when I ride with my leathers harness boots and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier BTW I've crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae cagers give
me a much wider berth don't hassle me and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights

I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre's Honda dinosaur
I think I have a pavlovian drool reflexI put the lock on ie on my
body and I can feel the bike already shaking away

Because riding a passenger doesn't really depend on the type of bike
The things you want a passenger to donot do is the same  Ergo if he's
asking advice I reasoned he doesn't have much practice period  If
you say he does fine  I still wouldn't take the uninitiated up a
road that's all switch backs and reversecenteruncrowned roadway not
to mention the BDCs and squids who will also be on that particular
road  He asked for advice and even though it wasn't what he meant

being a mere female I have often found I can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers so I found a more subtle and nastly
ooops I mean nasty way to get back at them If somebody cuts you up just wait till they have pulled out past you and then gently lean over and
bend their aerial every time I have done that it has eventually snapped
off near the base  which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace

Dear Gillian

That is such a wickedly cool idea why didn't I think of it However here
in Canada the aerials antenna are usually near the driver or passenger areas
and I would surely be seenbut I'll give it a try anyway

Thanks for the first truely useable piece of information I have heard in a long

Ed
DoD 

Being related to former trainers I have come to know that humans do have all the
advantages well at least one anyway It is a little known fact that a dog will
involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow I
was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and
force it down the dog's throat The dog would naturally gag and release and become
momentarily disoriented This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
have our throats examined  Proof Positive  In the time during the dog's
disorientation the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a 
choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
unconsciousness  from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow  Finally run like
the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
pissed

In response to Jerry Lotto's post about not putting your helmet on your
mirror or else risk damaging the padding from the inside

One of the major causes of mirror breakage is impact with the pavement
Laws mandating that all mirrors be protected by helmets might be in order
But seriously

One place to put a helmet is on a preferably clean footpeg hanging from
the chinguard away from any hot pipes

I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend

I was last in a line of traffic that was about  vehicles long riding
down Rt  in Groton Ma  At the side of the road sitting off on the
shoulder was the killer Volvo in question  No brake lights no turn signal
nothing  We were doing about  mph and I was following the cage in front
of me about  sec back  Well as said cage passes the Volvo the
Brain Dead Idiot tm behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait
for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic
so that she can turn around  So I get on the brakes in a effort to not
Tbone it and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up  As she finishes
the turn she looks up at me with a completely blank uncomprehending
stare

Where can I get rocket launchers for the VFR

Hello Folks

I'm very happy with my new RGS  My range is  miles on  gallons
that's  mpg  Surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  I was expecting
something rough   She's a sweet backroad honey  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike  As far as shaft effect it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  Rev it sitting still
when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence  Okay here are 
my questions

 Any recommendations for a homemade fairing  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest and perhaps my helmet for comfort at highway speeds
 mph yet don't want to a screw up the stability or b block my
vision too much for trail riding  Anybody have luck with twopiece 
detachible fairings  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas

 I run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar  The illumination's excellent that way with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it 
really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM  

 This is embarassing I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning  I invariably flood the carbs then go in and read a section
of the paper and then she starts right up  Is this a Zen thing 

 The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives Yeah right  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best  Additives

Thanks

 Mike Terry asks
 
 Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive
 
 No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects
 of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift
 off the ground
  
 DoD DarkMan
Well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie
The rear gear does climb the ring gear and lift the rear which gives an
odd feel but it still wheelies

 ' Virago

	Yep I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision I should mention  
that I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over   The wheelie was  
the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an  
intersection damn San Antonio cagers tend to be REALLY bad drivers  

	However I have done one by myself it just takes a lot of  
preclutch dump rev action

	just a passing comment

 What worked for me on my RD was to lean towards the dog as I modulated
 throttle to keep my ankle just ahead of his teeth  After a few seconds of
 warm pipe firmly wedged on his shoulder he turned his face sideways to see
 what was so warm and got his mouthnosemuzzle burned on the pipes

 A bicycling technique I've
employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog
attacks

One of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on
his megabuckmicromass bike He said he once repelled a dog attack by
picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
head with the rear wheel The dog had no idea what hit him and he
fled quite rapidly Then again he could jump garbage cans without a
ramp so I don't think I'd care to try this one on a motorcycle

The telephone worked much better than the tire pump

That's almost unfair I've never seen a dog that could use a phone

Ever notice little kid wave more than other bikers
             

The reactions of little boys seems to be the most enthusiastic to

has at least noticed my bike  I figure it helps the future of the
sport

Don't forget little girls  My notquite year old daughter now
excitedly points and says motorcycle every time she sees one go
past  I've done my work  Of course it helps that one of her
books shows Sir Topham Hatt in a chaffeured side car rig

I have to admit that I usually try to do so without the parental
figure noticing  Im afraid that the kid will get yelled at for
associatign with antisocietal types like us

Can you think of a better way to convince the kid that someday I'll
ride one of those things

Is it a genetic thing with little boys or what  Even three and four
year old boys seem magnetically attracted to motorcycles of virtaully
any sort often to the dismay of thier mothers 

No it's a genetic thing with little humans

 Hey what the hell do you mean by that  You suck  I have a godgiven
 right to express opinions carry a gun and to not wear a helmet goddamn 
 it Everything you stand for is STUPID
 
 I'd give it an  on a scale of  analysis and hints deleted
 
 Aw c'mon  The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points
 not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say
 The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish

Nope  Flames should be interesting  Around here guns  helmets
are the wallpaper

 I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames
 The first does trade quality'' in the sense you mention for heat
 This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly which I
 contend was done above is reasonably entertaining  

Not everyone in recmotoland is so easily amused  Blaine as an Elder
has seen the Superflamers at their peaks or depths if you prefer  
With that sort of incendiary backdrop awarding your faltering Bic a
 was the purest act of charity

 While 
 it is true that
 the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity friends
 dinner or entertainment it says what it needs to with the appropriate
 flair and it is short  The weakness of this type of flame is actually
 that it can easily be taken too far at which point it becomes trite and
 boring

Unless of course your audience has only seen several thousand similarly
uninspiring attempts in this arena  In that case the trite  boring
threshold tends to drift away from where you first set it as yours will
eventually or not

 The other type of flame which you seem to be glorifying above 
  blah blah blah 
 In summary Blaine your score for that flame is incorrect  While it may
 be the wunderflame the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
 weaknesses and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
 applicable  

Until you can yank the flame out of Blaine's Internet Port before he
can ioclose it you are in no position to lecture him grasshopper

 You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a
 flatulent dog stapled to your posterior and I'll bet you and your 
 motorcycle lean to the outside while turning  The same goes for anyone
 who looks like you too

Oh please yawn you're slipping further down the scale with each
successive attempt  It's so embarrassing to watch   Say you're not
from Waco are you

Well I was wrong  As I sat on the ST both feet down all I could 
think was big  Then I put one foot up  Heavy came to mind very
quickly  With Cindy on the back  was she on the back  Hard to 
tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat  the bike seemed
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road

It is heavy the  is mid 's dry that is the one major drawback
of the ST

By  rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear  Even

Can you say  tourque monster The test drive sold me on the bike 
lot's of bite anywhere above  in any gear

on bike with  miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that 

Did you trythe ABSTCS version 

Cindy has no difficulty with speed  rd gear th gear purring along
in top gear  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk  Lane 
changes were a new experience  A big heft is required to move this 
thing  Responds well though   No wallowing or complaint  Behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was

After market fairing windshield for  raises the bubble  inches
above most heads but hurts the looks of the bike

nontrivial  Top gear car passing at mph was nearly effortless
Smooth smooth smooth   Not sure what the v sound reminds me of
but it is pleasant  

This is the essence of the bike move the throttle and itr accelerates 
any gear anywhere anytime I frequently find myself at the DOD min 
during a casual passing maneuver

The jump on to  caused me to be less than impressed with the
brakes  Its a down hill reversing camber twicereversing radius
decreasing radius turn  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder  
This is a function of the weight you have to be aggresive with the brake
squeze actually as tested by Cycle world and an expert rider the ST
stopped faster then the comparable models from BMW and YAMAHA even with 
the extra weight and Gas 
The section of  we were on was tight but too urban  The ST works ok
in this section but it shows its weight  We went by the clam shack

You must countersteer the ST for every turn and movement short
of the classic pothole wiggle Just forget ever leaning into a 
turn again It must be countersteered into every turn and then 
responds nicely

About half way through the onramp I yanked Cindy's wrist our singal
for hold on tight  Head check left  time to find redline  Second
gear gives a good shove  Third too  Fourth sees DoD speed with a 
short shift into top  On the way to  we saw no cops and very light
traffic  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new
Well now it had  miles on it so it was ok  Tried some high effort
lane changes some wide sweeping turns  Time to wick it up  I went 
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat  And stayed
there  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering 
I looked down to find an indicated mph  Not bad for up touring

Faster then I've ever gone I 'd hate to buy this bike after your 
short break in period


to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front  Heavy  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put
the thing on the center stand  I am sure that if I used the side
stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute

Not true the side stand is well designed for the weight and will hold 
the bike nicely on dirt I am able to easily get the bike up on
the center stand just step down on the stand instead of pulling
up on the bike

My demo opinion  Heavy  Put it on a diet  Smooth comfortable
hardly notices the DoD speed   I'd buy on for about  less than 
list just like it is  Too much  for the bike as it is

Keep looking the  left overs if available are going for 
I love mine and I haven't found a better value then the ST for 
remember you get  years unlimited mileage warranty

Hi boys and girls  I just bought a Beemer RGS and realized abruptly that 
I am a grad student  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my 
Zephyr too

If I can sell it this month great  insurance and tags both run out in
a couple of weeks  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens

It's a very sweet bike   miles almost all highway AZWYCO last summer
plus some great rides between here and the Border  Purchased new exactly
one year ago Apr ' it's a ' model  It has a good fairing and a
luggage rack  Red very clean  Perfect maintenance no bullshit   I'll spare
any further details other than to say  I want to keep it and  somebody
'   will fit it like a charm  Not a bike for big people but not a
small bike  Standard upright positioning and goodlooking  Smooth power
great brakes good Karma

I eagerly await comment

The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the 
driveway when she sees me coming Probably only hits mph or so I made 
the mistake of waving to a neighbor She has some sort of grudge now

I was riding downhill at mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came 
flashing through the brush at well over mph on an intercept course with 
my front wheel The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard 
me and still had a lead when it hit the road The dog was approaching from 
my left and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of 
the road before I went by Rover was looking back at me to calculate the 
final trajectory Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at mph 
from the other direction

I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off 
the front bumper smacking the asphalt and getting runover by the front 
tire It managed a pretty good yelp just before impact peripheral 
imminent doom I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have 
swerved into my lane The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
home but I haven't seen it since 

Sniff

Yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering  Basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left

This sounds suspiciously like black magic to me  If by quick wiggle
to the right you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right
before turning to the left what is the input to the steering
mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old
shoveshove

Well as many a bored bike tourer can tell you the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean
Say you want to turn left  You push your body off to the left
To do this you have to push against something and the only
thing to push against is the ground through the bike  Well
the apple guy Wozniak or was that Churchill says that the 
ground will push you right back  So you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right and the ground 
pushed back toward the left  Well that push is on both wheels  
The rear wheel doesn't care unless you have serious bearing 
problems except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly which
had the revolutionary countersteeringcontrashaftdrive rear end 
but the front wheel has trail  If the ground pushes the front wheel 
toward the left at the contact patch the trail will cause the 
wheel to turn to the right  Hey there we are  Nohands counter
steering

you presumed you needed to split out a GS list
by implication of your split a plain ol' bmw
list wouldn't meet the GS riders' needs

for the sake of not forcing the split issue
how about changing the charter and renaming
your list from bmwgs to just bmw  would that
make everybody happy

  SQUIDS 

 I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist I felt the eyes of those
 in cages witnessing this display then glancing over to the dealers lot and
 damning all those on two wheels Needless to say my friend felt a little
 uncomfortable and we left 

Did you express your embarrassment to the owner  I don't blame you for being
embarrassed but I would have let my feeling be known that the behaviour of 
their sales staff and apparent enjoyment of such behaviour just cost them 
a sale and all further sales

 I will now turn off my frustration and go ride peacefully to clear my
 anger I only hope that the cop who is following me home has an open
 mind and doesn't associate me with them 

Sound good  Enjoy

 BTW I can't afford a new bike

Who can

 Now for those who have read this far  

 	Why did it rev at idle like that  Is water in the fuel an
 acceptable reaason or were they having me on

Sound like the pilot circuit was say leanclogged  I don't think
water would cause a problem like this but

 	Apparently the oil pump is doing its job and there was plenty
 of oil  Why did it seize

See above  Were you by chance coasting when it stuck  On a two stroke
you only have substantial lubrication when you are giving the bike gas
If it was lean on the pilot that's why it stuck

 Oh BTW  THe motor had been rebuilt just before I left Adelaide so had
 done about  miles when it blew  It was rebuilt because it had been
 seized at some time before we got it and it looked like that seizure
 had happened at low mileage because there were still hone marks in the
 bore

 The rebuild we did consisted of a total tear down new piston rings
 small end bearing and new gearbox bearings  Big end and rod judged
 OK


 Any ideas folks

You mentioned an aftermarket carb  I deleted the text  Looks like 
to me that's where your problem is

        What does DWI stand for  I thought it was DUI for Driving Under

 Driving While Intoxicated
 
   Actually I beleive DWI normally means Driving While Impaired rather
 than Intoxicated at least it does in the states I've lived in
 
 This was changed here in Louisiana when a girl went to court and won her 
 case by claiming to be stoned on pot NOT intoxicated on liquor
 
   One can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor  drugs
 not enough sleep being a total moron  all can impair someone etc  I'm
 surprised this got her off the hook  Perhaps DWI in Lousiana is confined
 to liquor
 
 Lets just say it is DUI here now

OK It varies from state to state It has to do with operating a vehicle
while there is greater than a given percentage of alcohol in your
bloodstream Can we drop this now and get back to asking Ed Green to
getabike

 Well sounds great to me When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me
 I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
 pumping the pedal You will obviously need a bit of free play in your
 brake pedal to do this It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
 usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
 himherit may mean that something is wrong

Sometimes yes sometimes no BDI cagers usually move back then
Hyperagressive assholes just move closer Something about

In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap
that is going on in the MOA which some folks took not as dissemination 
of information that I received but as my own bad mouthing I thought that
I would post this one which came to me yesterday  This is from board member
Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse  This is NOT my words OK guys

                                   April  

re  Cecil King's Nominating Statement 

Dear Chick
      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the 
MOA this year  Cecil King's nominating statement as it appeared in the
Owners News is  words nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the bylaws  In pertinent part the rules state

Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than  words The nominating committe shall cut afafter the th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length

    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task  Had Cecil's
statement been cut as required it would have concluded approximately with
the word undertiding sic in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his Position Statement  As a result Cecil has obtained what I view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president  This does
not just taint the election for that office it makes a mockery of the 
process  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election
     Parenthetically in your private correspondence with others I would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an asshole you remind the
letter's recipient that the republication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences
   With kind regards I remain
                                 Robert Higdon

OK MOA'ers You read it think for yourself I trust you do know who
Cecil King is and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass and he is
a pres candidate  I let you draw your own conclusions

I bought it I tried it
It is truly the miracle spooge
My chain is lubed my wheel is clean after km

I'd try it on the VFR but goddamn Competition Accessories hasn't mailed my
order yet  Hell it's only been two weeks and I was ordering some pretty
bizzare stuff  Like a clear RF face sheild and a can of Chain Wax
Bastards

For what it's worth I got my can in three days from Chaparral That's
UPS ground from CA to UT YMMV The stuff seems to work and it doesn't
attract grundge like PJ Blue does I gave it the acid test a full
day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the
sand dunes If there's anything wet  stickey it will be coated with
sand at the end of the day but the chain looked pretty clean

As far as mailorder goes if Chaparral has it in stock and they can
tell you if it's in stock or about how long it will take to backorder
it if it's not I usually get it in three days Competition Accessories
always seems to take a week or two to deliver Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse also takes a week or two and after trying to buy some boots
from them last week I don't think they actually stock anything MAW was
about  cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech  boots but on
Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week so I asked MAW a
completely unreasonable question Do you have them in stock The
conversation went something like this

I need to know if you have some boots in stock

	Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard

I want to know if you have them in stock

	Well the computer doesn't show anything I'd have to call the
	distributer to find out if we have them

So do you have them or not

	Don't you understand what I'm saying I have to call our
	distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not

Uh right So can you do it

	Yea call me back in an hour and ask for Phil

So an hour later Phil isn't there but Mike says he'll check and call
him back in half an hour Half an hour later Mike isn't there either
but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month
 weeks away Screw it the  bucks isn't worth the hassle I called
Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock

	Ooh Alpinestars Probably not they are hard to keep in stock
	but I'll check What size

Size 

	Let's see yes Size  in blue  white gray  white black

I'll take the blacks

This was about noon on Monday they arrived Thursday morning Once
again three days via UPS ground I like Chaparral

I'm not completely down on MAW they often have lower prices but be
prepared to wait

Oh and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff
Scorcher seems like a good outfit friendly fast had the tires I
wanted in stock and were cheaper than Chaparral too

Hello Folks
I'm very happy with my new RGS  My range is  miles on  gallons
that's  mpg  Surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  I was expecting
something rough   She's a sweet backroad honey  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike  As far as shaft effect it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  Rev it sitting still
when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion

	Not to start another shaft effect discussion but the twist you
	feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger flywheels that
	the BMW Rbikes maybe K's too dunno use If you whack the throttle
	at stop lights it'll really rock the bike over to the right

	snip 	snip
 I run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar  The illumination's excellent that way with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it 
really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM  

	Please post if you come to any conclusion on this I am thinking
	of putting a light on each cylinder guard on my RS and was
	wondering whether I was going to have to switch lights off every
	time I was under  RPM

In Shreveport back when I was riding the Purple Water Buffalo I jumped an 
intersection IN FRONT OF A COP who was waiting for the light  The side of 
the street he was on was hidden buy a building on the corner and I didn't 
see him till I was airborne in the middle of the intersection  I was 
parked had my helment off and my liscence out before he turned the corner  
He chewed my ass out and let me go  I will be the first to admit it was a 
very squidly thing to do jumping the intersection like that  The cop 
should have nailed me  I find that if you are polite respectfull and 
honest they will normaly let you get away with a LOT of stuff

I don't have the grips but have looked into getting them it's my

it's also my understanding that the heater resides inside the bar 
itself so if anything I would suspect it would reduce vibration by 
providing more bar end mass

I don't see why they wouldn't work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something

Someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order  The were

on the screws inside of a carb  At least it was roadside
fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time

Gee I always figured that it was the loose screws onin the rider
that were most likely to cause any problems  Did you check for that
at the same time

That is very true  However screws have been loose on this rider
for quite some time so they had been taken into account

I am looking for a new tank bag now and I wondered if you as follow 
FJ owners could make some suggestions as to what has and has

With the FJ's large flat gas tank I'd imagine that almost anything
would work Personally I'm quite happy with my Eclipse standard tank
bag

I think the only thing to watch for is the number of attachment
straps  Most come with  and some with  I have a Bagman  strap
tankbag and because the rear of the tank is so narrow the fit
is not optimal

Good point I'd overlooked that The Eclipse has a  point mount  at
the rear and  at the front and it's very stable on the FJ I have seen
some with harnesses that mount to the sides of the tank and that would
be a real problem on the FJ

lotsa stuff deleted

 Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be 
  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
  still there   The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider

Hmmmm  why does everyone on that side of the Pond seem to want
pillions to hang on to the rider rather than the grabrail 

Because I'm a guy and most of my pillions are female 

Also the other reasons like having an idea where you passengers
weight is it being a more comfortable position for the passenger
and it being a more stable configuration all come into it as well

Holding the grab rail is a great idea only for braking when you
don't want the pillion to slide forward into you otherwise I don't
find it works well

 I just got back from the th Annual Southern California Harley Dealers
Association Run to the Colorado river city of Lauglin Nevada

Why is it that some people can't enjoy themselves without being assholes

If you want to be treated with respect you need to treat others their 
property and their towns with respect

Several years ago I was at the Annual Flyin of the Experimental Aircraft
Association EAA near Oshkosh Wisconsin Although approximately 
people were in attendance there was not a piece of litter anywhere  Everyone
was considerate enough to place their trash where it belonged

There's no problem in having fun raising hell etc  But consideration
and respect for others is critical we need to work WITH each other not
against

Nudity fineloud noise fineparty all night fine but at the right
place and time  Please let's not trample over other's rights and then bitch
because they don't treat us like gods

Michael Menard

 You know I wasn't EVEN going to respond to this typical antiparty
attitude message Trash was everywhere  reason Not enough dipsy
dumpsters for the massive crowd Oatman wasn't prepared for the vast
number of PEOPLE that showed up
 BTW Michael Oatman is the RIGHT PLACE  TIME It's called a RUN Maybe
you didn't read my comment that They loved us and I'm talking about the
merchants and townspeople The merchants that didn't want us  their shops
were closed
  Maybe I should have mentioned that when I left  the trash was being
picked up aluminum sells by a crew assigned to the task
  I think the bottom line here is do they want us back  They Do
This 'action' that went on at Oatman is TYPICAL on a predominatly Harley
run It's innocent fun
  So since I enjoy TYPICAL Harley fun at Runs  in your eyes that makes me
an asshole I've already admitted I'm an asshole many times on the net
All my friends are assholes too lyrics to a new song So you want a
dime to call someone that cares
  It appears we have a difference of opinion Maybe you should look at the
big picture before you pass judgement on others th Annual That should
tell you something

it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists
unless of course the existing list failed to meet the readers'
needs

nowhere did I see you mention K bikes which being made by BMW are 
welcome on my list in fact you go out of your way to say

           most all boxer talk is welcome

your list appears to cater to boxers that's great my list caters to
BMW's without any restrictions like you have considering that the
subscription count went to  within  hours of my initial post about
the list which was made around pm just before I went to bed I'd 
say that there is a need for a BMW list as opposed to just a GS boxer 
list

my motivation for setting up the BMW list came from an earlier post of 
yours announcing your boxer list it didn't fit my needs

ok we've pissed on each other's list let's get back to the regular

 it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists
 unless of course the existing list failed to meet the readers'
 needs
you presumed you needed to split out a GS list
by implication of your split a plain ol' bmw
list wouldn't meet the GS riders' needs

good point  the list actually started out as an extension of my GS
v FJ shootout list which is why it got that name  since inception
however other boxerinterested folks have joined and the conversation
has not always been geared to gspdstspecific topics

for the sake of not forcing the split issue
how about changing the charter and renaming
your list from bmwgs to just bmw  would that
make everybody happy

when i raised the to expand or not to expandthat is the question
question on the list itself there were mixed feelings  the list has
always been open to anyone with a nonbouncing from line and there
has been general agreement that only boxerrelated stuff is
appropriate  almost all of the subscribers own RR GSSTPD
bikes although some R RT and RS owners are also on it

at this point my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace
and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as
possible  the list is fairly technical with how do i do this
what kind of that should i get kinds of questions  there has yet
to be any nonBMW bashing K bike bashing or any bmw mfg'd after
 is a piece of shit bashing  such posts are by consent of the
governed proscribed

if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the
netboxerowners then i am not going to stand in the way of progress

so hesh let me turn the question around have you or has anyone
else not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded

 Any other feedback from someone who has used this

What about the new Yamaha Cyclelok 
From the photo in Motorcyclist it looks the same hardened steel as a 
Kryptonite U lock except it folds in five places
It seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of
a parking sign or similar

Anyone had any experience with them how easy is it to attack the lock

Now just wait one cotton picking minute here DoD rule  section 
paragraph  clearly indicates that multiple people can't lay claim to a bike
in an obvious ploy to artificially increase the size of their stable

So the question of the day is Is Spike owned by a lady of true class and
breeding my definition any woman who rides   or by Tom the harely head
Spike is owned by both Tom and I  We went 's on the purchase price
and have split costs of needed parts registration etc  Both names are
on the pink slip

I also note that you lay no claim to Connie or Ol Sport Like I said 
obviously a lady of discriminating taste
I am covered by insurance to ride the Harley   I'd give it a go if
I could work the clutch  I can barely get the clutch lever to move
using both hands while standing next to the bike  Ol' Sport is a
very distinctive bike
The Concours is favorite of mine  I've pillioned an easy  miles
on that bike in the last year  Unfortunately my feet are a good
 off the ground once I'm on her  No way I could take her for a
ride as pilot rather than pillion  If I could fit on a Concours I'd
buy one  IMHO the best sporttourer made  I'm not too upset
I had to settle for the Ducati SS as my touring bike though 

Bored minds wanta know
So now you know

I've only ever done it in an automatic I was sitting in my Olds in

dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half
where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was I've never
had occasion to do it on a bike but I imagine that it would be even
easier because you could slip beside the car in front Giving a gander
at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch

screeching

If you had been looking in your mirror you would have seen the guy coming 
before you heard the screeching tires

When you're stopped at a light

  Stop so that you're got space in front of you and a quick easy escape
route between lanes into a crosswalk up a driveway somewhere if someone
decides they want to plow into you

  Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars
are stopped behind you so you don't have to waste a second you don't have
trying to get it in gear if you need to move

  Watch your mirrors  In that situation most of the hazards you are 
trying to avoid are coming from behind you  SIPDE  msfgeekspeak
isn't just for when you're moving  And you're less likely to panic and stall
the bike if you've got time to prepare before the guy's tires lock up behind
you  You still get the bejeezus scared out of you but it's more a feeling
of quicklyrising dread than a sudden jolt

Orating with wild abandon prangenickelucsindianaedu Henry Prange offers
The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem
in the summer Vibration BMW's don't vibrate Everyone knows that

I'd agree with Henry  The grips are really nice to have in winter
and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer  

My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'
This has been complained about by every reviewer official and
unofficial that's ever talked about these grips  The 'high' setting
is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things
just get a bit nippy but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable
effect I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature
about right  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker
winter gloves  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it I
received a consoling pat on the back and their sincere apologies for
the poor design actually I was told they worked just like they were
suppose to

Vibration  What's that  I ride a BMW twin  You can barely tell if
the engine is fired up or not most of the time smoother than silk
sheets

Another good place for your helmet is your mirror  I kid you not If
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable

Be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the
mirror  It will depress the foam liner in the helmet  That is not the
kind of foam that bounces back like foam rubber  Its purpose in life
is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin
If your mirror compresses it there is that much less energy absorbing
capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash

I found the right handlebar to be a good spot if on the sidestand
Hang with the chinbar facing up balanced across the grip and brake
lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the
chinbar foam  This is more challanging with an open face helmet

This is really the only thing we disagree on Maybe we should agree to
disagree 

OK but I'm right  

The official line here though I do have my doubts about it is that the
front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place 

If that's the official line taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to that also don't teach countersteering I have to
question the quality of the classes  The official line in MSF
curricula is as I described  Maximum braking is achieved by applying
both brakes equally when the weight distribution is nominally even and
both tires have equal normal forces and easing off on the rear to
prevent locking it and increasing braking on the front as more
traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to
weight shift

The official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face
of it  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage
of all the traction available to the rear at time  and is halving the
available braking power by using only the front at time 

Saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless
advice to a newbie  He has to go out and slide the tire to find out
where that is  It also gives him zero information from which to
develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and
corresponding weight shift develop

If you don't slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not I'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can  but if you want to find the
limits of the machine you have to go beyond them 

Not necessarily true  Chirping the tire indicates impending lockup
on most surfaces and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate
maximum braking  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally
makes one a better rider but it is a manuver best saved for an
experienced rider unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like
Code used to use

In any case for maximum braking if as I suggested you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding then you'll be doing
exactly as you suggest

True but from the point of view of how to best teach riding skills
which is how this discussion started keep both wheels just on the
point of sliding is nearly useless information  You need to teach a
technique or at least a strategy to achieve this

Countersteering is a method for leaning the bike  Another method is
leaning  Once leaned the bike turns all by itself

 Various posts about shafties can't do wheelies
 
   No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects

   off the ground
 
 Good point Johna buddy of mine told me that same thing when I had my

 you know what He was right
 
 Uh folks the shaft doesn't have diddleysquatpoop to do with it I can get
 the front wheel off the ground on my  ferchrissake

you may have been able to bounce the front up but not
actually do a wheelie see the shaft effect unloads
the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front
this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts
scraping in a corner

Also NC recently last few years decided that due to the fact there
are constantly people on the road drunk driving they will raise
their awareness of it by making stricter laws and as such now I believe
NC has the toughest laws for DWI while not necessarily increasing any
amount of awareness or kills on the highways  meaning it's
only made a difference at sentencing

Automatic revocation of your license for a year  I'm not sure it's the
toughtest law around but NC has absolutely no sense of humor with
respect to driving laws anyway  I think they put you in jail and sell
your first child into slavery for passing a school bus

A bill breezed through the NC House to lower the intoxification level
from  to   It faces stiff opposition in the Senate  Recently
the Highway Patrol took a few of the opposition Senators out and gave
them some shots and when they hit  put them on a course dodging
cones  They failed and will probably change their votes as a result

For some bizarre reason NC is the only state where the governer has no
veto power over legislation coming out of the state Congress so his
opinion on the matter is moot

I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent 
experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London 

I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot that
is if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on
hard for braking or acceleration I tried to always look over the
inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible leaving
Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and 
luggage

Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit 
off the back is hard to fight Similarly I held on to the grab handles
tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp I'm
a lot bigger than he is Reaching around him and pushing off the 
tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for 
him to manage

On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself I absolutely
refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding That's
helmet jacket gloves stout pants and shoesboots as a minimum It's 
not my responsibility to provide this gear but it's my responsibility
to require it if they want to ride

And I agree with an earlier poster if you've not had much experience
carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried
many passengers before take a few gentler rides of some duration before
you head off to a difficult road like MinesMt Hamilton That's a 
nasty place to find yourself in trouble

My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
something I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
approved method Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target
then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you This time it
didn't work because I didn't have time Riding up the hill leading to my
house I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
the Spagthorpe Viking Actually the dog encountered me with intent to
harm

But I digress I was riding near the unpainted centerline of the
roughly foot wide road doing between forty and sixty clicks  mph
for the velocityimpaired The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the
left side of the road at an impossibly high speed I later learned he
had been accelerating from the front porch about thirty feet away
heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road I
saw the dog and before you could say SIPDE he was on me Boom I took
the dog in the left leg and from the marks on the bike my leg was
driven up the side of the bike with considerable force making permanent
marks on the plastic parts of the bike and cracking one panel I think
I saw the dog spin around when I looked back but my memory of this
moment is hazy

I next turned around and picked the most likely looking house The
apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt cut
mouth and hoped I was not hurt either I could feel the pain in my
shin and expected a cool purple welt to form soon Sadly it has not
So I'm left with a tender shin and no cool battle scars

Interestingly the one thing that never happened was that the bike never
moved off course The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike
off course nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some
gut reaction to the sudden impact Delayed pain may have helped me
here as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember

What worries me about the accident is this I don't think I could have
prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was This is not
necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but I was
riding around the speed limit I worry about what would have happened if
it had been a car instead of a dog but I console myself with the
thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a
blind driveway at  mph For that matter how many driveways are
long enough for a car to hit  mph by the end

I eagerly await comment

tolls one must pay on route  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the   seconds to make the transaction
Taking gloves off getting money out of coin changerpocket making
transaction putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and
usually go to another booth

My question is this a goodbad thing to do

I have a question about tires for my Guzzi It is a ' T The tires that
were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked I do not have an
owners manual for it yet but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are
Front  H   Rear  H  and pressures recommended are  front and
 rear Oddly the pressure for the same tire on the T is listed at  psi
instead Anyone know the reason As I know though the pressure I should run
at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase

The real question I have is this The old tires that are on the bike are for
the front a Metzler Touring Special  H  and for the rear an Avon
Roadrunner  H   H  as marked on each tire Both are larger
than that listed in the Haynes Manual What does the owners manual recommend
and was it common to go up one size for this bike Also this will be my first
motorcycle with innertubes Any comments on the various manufacturers inner
tube qualities

The above sizes are inches except for the additional mark on the current
rear tire What is the best metric match The local BMW dealer thought
 H  on the front and  H  on the back He also happens to be
very good at getting close to matching mail order prices

I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME Laser possibly Comp K on the
front and ME on the back both in MBS variety if possible the longer 
lasting belting system I already use the ME on both the Vision and
FJ for the front and like it and I thought that with the shaft drive
behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME might give more predictable
back end control and sliding behavior than a ME might as well as giving
much better tire milage life Any comments

A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very
good but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls I do not wish to
mount the tires myself this first time so aside from warning the shop to be
careful any other comments I should make I havn't looked at the rim to
check out the make yet if it is marked He just told me late yesterday and
I havn't had a chance to check the rim type

On another note I will remove the ugly but in good shapeanyone want it
Vetter fairing and I will run without a windscreen for a while but eventually
I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it It could be
forkhandlebar mounted Any suggestions Is there such a thing as a frame
mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike How about lower
barsclipons for it I would like to restore the bike into a good condition
runner with a few modern updates but while not being historically exactly
accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'
style Yes I know to be picky that period really predates this bikeit is
just that this bike has such potential for that look

Here is the part that concerned me The HG and those shop personel that were
not busy with customers went back out where said HG members fired up their
rides and did the obligatory reving up of those  beasts At this point
one decided to see how much rubber  a Katana  could deposit in the drive

SQUIDS I thought to myself BUT I was appalled that the salesdroidsmanager
not only condoned this behavior but encourged it to the point were they
were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely
as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike seemed rather hormonal about this display and urged her
pilot to quickly catch up The others followed making sure there Kerkers
could be heard as well as felt

Um you gotta understand these salesdroids as you call them  They look at
it this way burn lotsa tire make lotsa money  I'm sure s he knew how
stupid the HG was  Would you seriously stop them from burning off 
a seasons worth of tire  The SQUIDS probably would buy Metzelers or some
good low profile tire anyhow

Yep  Them droids sure a sneaky bastards

The FT is fun I wanted to buy one  But I waited  years an bought
a Hawk instead  Friends owners of the former cycle shop on  in
Andover bought one new but several years old  Cost him 
You should not pay too much for one

I hear they can be fitted with the front end of a cc Interceptor
and thus have great brakes  Sounds like fun  Some dude on this
forum has one thats all tricked out

Second Hand Bike warns that they are fine up until  miles

The FT is a good beginner's bike with
    a reasonable seating position
    enough power to get you up and around but
       not so much it'll scare the bejeebers out of you
    tips over well and easy to pick up
       don't ask
    simple maintenance

I've had mine for four or so years and haven't had any
serious problems with it  I bought it used for  with
about  miles on it

Just last week someone in the neighborhood stopped by to
ask me about it whether I thought it was a good beginner's
bike is it comfortable and powerful enough blah blah blah
Seems he found one used for   with about  miles on it

The reall trick mod I've heard was to take the front end from
a  hurricane and slide it in  This was from a guy who
campaigns two Ascots in SOS racing  He says they do pretty
well too once you strip off the starter lights and other
assorted street paraphernalia its a pretty fast and light bike

chain drive more efficient hmmmmm


Well maintained chains running in oil without those little rubber 'O' rings 
to cause frictional losses might reach  efficiency  The average open to

I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions


Anybody who drove into somebody like that in this country would hopefully 
lose their licence  However the avoidance is simple  Don't stop behind the 
cage stop beside it or better still in front of it so that it acts as a 
buffer

Earlier I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell  Well
I saw one think that someone said about Show me a team that used Split
fires  Well here's some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the x cages  Well for these guys splitfires

Now I don't know about all of this and I'm trying to catch up with
somebody about it now but Splitfires should help twins more than

Splitfires work mainly by providing a moreorless unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque Splitfires didn't do diddlysquat for my  GMC
pickup l V but do give a noticeable performance boost in my  Harley
Sportster  and my best friend's  Sportster  Folks I know who've
tried them in  Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain
plugs which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape just different sizes Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead
I'd dualplug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make
the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense plus they look
really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head

 another to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless  I am sitting
 at a light about    car lengths behind a car a wise decsion  Suddenly I 
 hear screeching tires  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the 
 moroon flying up right behind me in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the
 bike  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel
 
 I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
 really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions
 
Another tip is to make sure you keep well to one side of the lane This gives
you a quicker escape route

 hello there
 can anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
 comment on its handling 
 
 
    Some guy came to the OMRRA race school last weekend with number plates
    on his VMax  He didn't get more than  practice laps in before he pushed
    the frame too hard and it drove him into the guard rail on the back
    straight
 
    Portland International Raceway is now for on VMax'es
 
    VMax  handling  Ferget it
 
    BTW  The rider was conscious and semicoherent when the ambulance
    carted him off  That's all I know

I hate to pick on someone who may have been seriously injured let's hope
not but semicoherent sounds like a good description of someone who
shows up at the track w a VMax in the first place

Has anyone any experience with the new Yamaha Cyclelok 

It looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a Kryptonite U lock
but unlike a U lock it is hinged in  places and opens out to a large
rectangle longer length than any U lock I have seen plus it folds down
to real small so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for example

I was curious as to how well the jointed sections would stand up to attack

For what it's worth I got my can in three days from Chaparral That's

	I'll third the recommendation as Miracle Spooge

	Don't go to the dealer to get it or what happened to me might happen

 Any other feedback from someone who has used this

What about the new Yamaha Cyclelok 

	It is far from new  It's been around almost as long as dirt

From the photo in Motorcyclist it looks the same hardened steel as a 
Kryptonite U lock except it folds in five places
It seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of
a parking sign or similar

Anyone had any experience with them how easy is it to attack the lock
at the jointed sections 

	I had one for one of my old bikes  Worked fine  I'm sure being
rigid and nonflexible that the Cyclelok would yield instantly to the freeze
and break routine

	But then for  what do ya want

was about  Centigrade and it just started snowing OK you are right I 
live in Canada The cop checked my license insurance ownership looked at 
my frozen nose and fingers told me to watch the speed limit more closely 
and entering his cruiser told me I was doing  instead of  kmh 
Didn't ticket me and I REALLY slowed down after that  I already mentioned 
it started to snow

   Request for opinions	

   Which is better  a onepiece Aerostitch or a twopiece Aerostitch



Like most everyone else I ended up getting two different sizes for
the top and bottom  My top is a L and the bottom is a L  For the
bottom the waist is far too large but the thighs fit just right the
 had a better waist but cut off the circulation in my legs I have
large muscular thighs and no I didn't use the thighmaster to get
them   The jacket fits me ok in the chest slightly snug at the
waist and too small in the arms  I can't imagine finding a onepiece
size that would have fit correctly as even the  piece has it's
problems strange since my VPilot jacket fits great all over and
when I tried the matching pants they fit like a glove as well

I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are
in some way different from us real folks

Also even though it's related to convienience you look pretty damn
wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands
I've gotten some really suspicious looks and sweated a lot while in a
store wearing the whole suit since you can't fit the top and bottom
in any motorcycle storage device yet devised except the trunk in my
sidecar rig   With the two piece I unzip the pants I generally
leave the two pieces zipped together primarily because the pants fall
down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belttype band real tight
stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags the pants just fit
and run errands just wearing the jacket  Actually if I know I'll be
running errands I just wear my VPilot jacket but that's just me

As far as crash protection I'd say that both suits are probably
equal  It seems that for weather protection if anything the  piece
provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by
 inches  The  piece is probably a little less comfortable around
the waist just because of the extra layer of stuff but maybe not

So I'd have to vote for the two piece  Despite the slightly odd fit
I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I
own  Wouldn't go long distance without it

Any help would be nice  Thank you for your support

Spring break I went through the four corners area and back  The most
beautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook  Though this
is a bit further east than where you appear to be going I highly
recommend it  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon  It
was not well marked but was one of few paved roads off of US I was
heading north from Monticello  In order to get to the right place I
should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK and not the recreation
area  Heading north from Monticello it is the second turnoff and may
have been marked as the Anticline Overlook  Anticline overlook is
about  dirt if this matters to you miles past the Needles
overlook  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably
maintained I ran it about mph

Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on 
the world  If it isn't too far out of your way you should see it

Well it's closer to Bryce than Bryce is to Arches I'd spend a lot
of time studying the maps there's a lot of you can't get there from
here in that area You might want to hit the Grand Canyon on the way
up from California loop around to CanyonlandsMoabArches and then
back down towards Bryce  Zion on the way home

Make sure you ride US  between Capitol Reef and Bryce it's been on a
number of top  roads lists


A nice booklet detailing a lot of interesting paved Byways and unpaved
Backways roads can be ordered from the Utah Travel Council I think
you can also get a state map from them just for asking

chain drive more efficient hmmmmm

Well maintained chains running in oil without those little rubber 'O' rings 
to cause frictional losses might reach  efficiency  The average open to 
the dust 'O' ring motorcycle chain probably has a difficult job making  
efficient

How about some sources for all these numbers Or is this more stuff that
everybody knows

  Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive

	Yes but the rear wheel comes off the ground not the front
 See it just HOPS into the air  Figure

   I know the roads up there in Minnesota are pretty bad but I doubt that
they are THAT bad  I've never realy tried to watch my back tyre but my 
Maxim  will pull the front wheel off the ground if I pop the clutch
Admittedly it is easier with someone on back maybe that's what keeps the
rear tyre down

 hello there
 can anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
 comment on its handling 
 Vmax racing horror story deleted 
    Portland International Raceway is now for on VMax'es
 
    VMax  handling  Ferget it

Actually a WERA racer William Lumsden considered running a Vmax in 
A Superstock  He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day and
really annoyed the  riders  they usually got caught behind a 
sideways Vmax in the corners and if they passed him going in he'd
blow by down the straight usually wobbling  Needless to say since
he was  seconds faster on a  CBF he decided against the Vmax

Too bad

All our local 'experts' say it's the tappits that need some adjusting so
I am soon to attempt that  I would like any advice anyone had 

If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve I have
the same question  Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the
adjustment process or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock 
Obviously the latter would be cheaper what do shims cost but are
measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims

A few months ago in one the the motorcycle mags there was
an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to
be available thru BMW  The idea was that the tape would look
black in sunlight and reflect in other colors at night to
headlights  It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime 
visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction

I talked to the local BMW dealer about this  I was told that the 
only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector was it being 
used in a coming line of BMW clothing rainsuits  He wasn't aware 
of anything regarding self applied tape

Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source

Thanks

One of the reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was
becase he had a BMW 

Sigh   That's music to my ears after all the complaining Lois did
about the seat on my BMW

The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive  Echo the movements
and lean of your rider  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable
but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn

I've found that the phrase sack of potatoes works pretty well in
describing to a passenger how she should act

Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be 
sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
still there   The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider

On a long ride with my exgirlfriend Nancy I would notice her
drifting off every so often we were droning down highway  to LA
I probably wouldn't have been aware of this if she hadn't been in the
habit of squeezing my butt with her knees to hold on   Good advice

Any lock including the Kyptonite utypes are EASY to break into if the person has
the proper supplies andor motivation  minutes and your bike is gone
I would be glad to explain but I dont want to contribute to any unlawful
activities Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off
by such a trival tactic WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft
the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lockpicker to walk away with your
property  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock
of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned

 Various posts about shafties can't do wheelies

 Good point Johna buddy of mine told me that same thing when I had my
 BMW RGS I dumped the clutch at rpm hey ito nly revved to  or so and
 you know what He was right
 
 Uh folks the shaft doesn't have diddleysquatpoop to do with it I can get
 the front wheel off the ground on my  ferchrissake
 
you may have been able to bounce the front up but not
actually do a wheelie see the shaft effect unloads
the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front
this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts
scraping in a corner

	Sorry to be contradictory but I've had my Nighthawk at  degress
with the horizon and I wasn't banked over in a turn  
	The hard part is getting the front in off the ground  I rev to about 
 at DROP the clutch   Even harder is keeping it from coming up to far
I use the back brake as well as the throttle  Once its up it'll wheelie just
like any other bike

 Grr Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today
 
 Went up to visit a friend overnight about  minute ride rode up after 
work only minor drizzing for the last  minutes of the ride rest of the 
ride was very zen
 
 Got up this morning needed to go home and get some disks  stuff to work 
on her computers with rainy as all hell Soaked and cold by the time I got 
home
 
 Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry I said to heck 
with it and drove my cage back up
 
 Lo and Behold those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm 
yellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was  minutes 
into the trip
 
 And me in my cage Oh JOY
 
 
 Happily my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer dropped the 
bike when I first got it put on an EMGO replacement mirror hated it the 
entire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing 
through it plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors so you 
get a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur And I got a replacement windshield for my 
fairing dropped the original and chipped the front edge cosmetic but 
annoying so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing 
them this afternoon
 
 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ' CBT is the damned 
 DCell Flashlight headlight
 
 Has anyone seen a good source for  watt halogen passing lights Since 
the charging system on the CBT can't handle continuous use of a W 
halogen headlight I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights 
on that would give me w of lighting for the rare night riding I do 
but wouldn't drain the battery during normal use chiefly day trips and 
commuting to work and back

Some potentially cool story stuff here Do share the details

	HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR  IN A 

It's simple  First it has to be the first really nice riding day
of spring  The bike is back together again and so are you  Grab
all your gear put it on and fill the tank with  octane premium
or better  Head out

	In Ames there is a road that leads to the little town of
Gilbert  Gilbert has one stop light if that tells you something
Having just gotten the bike back together I thought I'd take it
for a short ride and check things out  Heading out of town I
went into the twisties at a slow pace just under the speed limit
and started leaning around  The pace quickened as everything felt
just right  Finally the road straightened and I was ready for a
bit of speed  Grab third gear open her up  At roughly mph
grab fourth gear  Look at as much of the bike as you can and fail
to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind  Twist
the throttle like a fool grab fifth gear at  or so and see
just how well she's been put back together

	At  according to radar I noticed the front fender was
flexing a bit  Thus I slowed pulled off the road removed my
helmet and gloves unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny
pack and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper
pulled in all hot and flustered

	Have you ANY idea how fast you were going
Not precisely no  I was paying attention to the bike and road
not the instruments  I just got her back together last night and
I'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic
	My radar says you were at over mph  Care to tell me why
I shouldn't give you a ticket
Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and
traffic on a strait and flat road while wearing all the protective
gear that safety demands note I wasn't quite that eloquent
	Say what kind of bike is that anyway
I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda  a Rat Bike
	Yeah I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years
compare riding stories
pack toolkit having tightened that fender
	So why were you out here
I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through
me  If the bike fails somehow in a mph zone I'm dead  If it holds
up out here then I know it will work right in traffic  I do this
evvery year when I rebuild her
	Not any more  You'll find a better place than my highway
to do those speeds  If I ever catch you speeding on my highway
again I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can  Now get
out of my sight before I write you a ticket
Yes officer
	And kid keep your eyes open out there drives off

	And that in a nutshell is how to get a warning for  in a 
I don't guarantee that it will work for you but it worked for me

Course the only people who seem to be acting smug now probably have chain
final drive which as we all know is less efficient and has higher 
 maintenance and probably didn't know the answer at the start of the thread
 
Anyway I have Laz's solemn assurance that hesheit was serious with the 'only
paralevers can pull true wheelies' assertion whatever the hell that means

So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars Open Budweiser in left

If I lean and the 
bike turns am I countersteering

No the bars would turn only toward the direction of turn in
nohands steering

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer
I'll supply one

Yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering  Basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle
than a bicycle though because of the extra weight  Ok so my
motorcycle is heavy  Maybe yous isn't

 I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my  Ninja
 This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
 read farther than around the block    We'll be riding some twisty 
 fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans
 
 This person is  lbs and fairly small so I don't see weight as too much
 of a problem but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go

My fiancee' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding up  I'll tell you 
what we've found and the systems we've worked out

 On starts accelerate MUCH slower than usual  It's tough for the rider
to judge how scary fast acceleration is because we're holding onto something
and leaning forward  Remember this

 On turns have her lean forward and at the same angle as you normally 
this means she isn't leaning at all  It's very disconcerting to be leaned
over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up
Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous

 On slowing and stopping do so MUCH slower than usual  Again it's tough 
for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is because we're holding 
onto something and leaning forward  However you'll figure it out fast
because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you which 
shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location

 Generally have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike not 
out wide  This helps balance and gives her somegrip

 When you passenger is in fear she will squeeze her knees against you
Normally this means slow down and do it now  


 turning so she leans with me but what else  Are there traditional
 signals for SLOW DOWN or GO FASTER or I HAFTA GO PEE etc

We only have a couple signals  Slow down is her either tapping me on 
the back or slapping my helmet with all her might  Depends on the urgency
of the matter 

Turn here is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit  This is
also the sign for cool  Look at that  I hafta pee is the same sign
as turn here  I'm hungry is the same sign  Go faster is usually
done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee  I usually see slow
down more often than go faster
 
 I really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that
 she'll want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated

The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy and 
pillion on his or her bike  It's incredibly frustrating because you're 
in almost no control  Now multiply that feeling times ten because
you as a rider know what your bike will do and your passenger will likely
feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time or lock up the brakes
at any moment or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain etc  
Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad

Also remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride up
than by yourself because you're concentrating on much more and
in the Zen of the moment less  Remember this

first extended ride That's kinda like taking someone on a noshow way
speed star competition as their first skydive

This person is  lbs and fairly small so I don't see weight as too much
of a problem but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go
I want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and
I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
turning so she leans with me but what else  Are there traditional

 If the Ninja has adjustable suspension adjust it to a stiffer
setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves

 Tell her the  cardinal rules are

a NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down Not when you stop at a STOP
sign not when she thinks you're gonna crash never Keep them on the
pegs until you tell her to get off the bike

b She is to hold onto your waist She should hold on tightly enough
that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit And
added bonus for you here she should keep as close to your butt as
possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your
balls up onto the gas tank You decide how best to word this

c Just stay perpendicular to the bike straight up in the seat Don't
lean your body into curves just go with the bike and stay perpendicular
Don't look over your shoulder

 Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back That
means don't pop the clutch and try to corner and stop smoother than
usual Be aware that if you jump on the brake you're going to have
the equivalent of a  lb dead weight crashing into you from behind
so be prepared for that

 Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't
have to go No antiwomen stuff here I have a tiny bladder myself

 Remind her to look around while you're riding Point to things
of interest It makes the ride more enjoyable to her she won't get
so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet and it gives
her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at

 My wife and I tried the MSFrecommended look over the rider's
shoulder in curves bit and it just didn't work The timing of
her weight shift was unpredictable especially on the Maxim because
unlike the Ninja the upright riding position really restricts the
pillion's view of the road ahead Next time I had her just remain
perpendicular to the bike and I could hardly tell there was someone
else on the bike in curves and she weighs substantially over  lbs

Greetings netters

Steve writes  about Cobra Locks

Well I have the mother of all locks On Friday the th of April I took
possesion of a ' Cobra Links lock  diameter This was a special order

I weighs a lot I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder
after about two blocks

I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel a HD
padlock for the steering lock a Master padlock to lock the cover to two
front spokes and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a
post in an underground parking garage

Next Friday the th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on
me bike

When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home

By the way I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links
and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes two of
them I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links The
guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much
and the inner tubes were free

Later

Okay DoD'ers here's a goddamn mystery for ya 

Today I was turning a  degree corner just like on any other day but there
was a slight difference  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension
to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
tangible thunk  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage 
My bike is a Kawasaki GPXR with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such
that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc and on the
lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a bankfollower or a
little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a
banked turn  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 
mm long which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg  Now for the
mystery

The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent  I'm
fairly sure it was there before the event  There was no damage to the end of
the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been  In fact the thread in
the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something
having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously  

Okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   How can you
rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without
damaging the thread in the hole   Is this some sort of hitech design thingo
that Kawasaki never mentioned like that the end of the footpeg suddenly
changes phase on impact to let the stud rip out then changes back to a solid
  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened  In the meantime life
goes on without a lefthand bankfollower

Dogs will chase anything that moves I have two dogs and they love
chasing me when I ride off They will also chase any car that passes
 running along the footpathsidewalk at up to kph They don't
seem to go after trucks though the size difference must be a factor

It also works in my favour though I can exercise them quite easily
by riding  mile up the road and back a few times

 I'm terribly sorry

   And so you damned well should  be  young whippersnapper  It's  wet
   kippers at ten paces if there's any repeat of this sort of thing

   Now in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreckmoto let's  mutate
   Take your partners by the hand

   On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours when I should have been
   working with a  torch brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest
   holes in  Yamadog's exhaust  pipes s'mazin'  what you  can do  with  a
   couple of AA  cells and a  threevolt bulb   I stuck some  gungum
   into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike

   So last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold  the
   sodding thing starts  blowing again   I check  it out and  the gas  is
   escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the
   port  As far as I can see it being somewhat hole of Calcutta at the
   time the nuts are still there  stop that bloody sniggering you  at
   the back but the pipe is a bit loose

   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socketset  to
   tighten up me' nuts somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good
   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold
   abloodygen I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from
   the inner sleeve right at the clampmating bevel  So I stuff in a bit
   of bakedbeanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best gungum  and
   come to work late again so that I  can ask of the oracle  Will  a
   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port  Anybody tried it

   Oh and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  
   and a    brazing  rod made  by  Gaz  Yup   the  camping  folks
   Surprised the marmalade outa' me too in that place just off the Isle

I have a  Honda CBT which for most of my purposes runs well 
However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load 
That is on a mild upgrade   mph in th or th I'm lucky if I can
hold speed  If I try to add throttle much past  rpm power drops
drastically  Put simply under load the engine won't rev past 
rpm  The top thirdhalf of the throttle range is dead  Standing still
the engine runs fine up to red line K

Other phenomenology at about the point that power loss kicks in the
engine becomes a little wavery  That is at a steady throttle the
engine speed goes up and down slightly  The bike has about  miles
on it and is in good tune at least until it starts to balk

I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast 
My thoughts run toward clogged jets andor improper spark advance  I'm
hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth
the hassle of any major engine work

Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
 position switch but sure enough as Deam expected  when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on

This provides a very nice light coverage of the
road


Hmmmm I noticed sometime ago that I could do the same on my Virago and
since I don't read many schematics I didn't really think aobut it too
much   Yes it does provide excellent coverage but I figured it would
probably draw a little too much current  I also figured that it was 
overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight  Are you saying 
that these switches are designed for the hilo combination

Yep it works like a charm I had the same problem after about  years
of constant use and I was thinking of seeing how much Eclipse would
want to install a new zipper But someone I think it was Chuck Karish
suggested I try that trick It took a couple of tries to get the right
amount of squish but it's been fine for about  years since I squished
it It should work for any of the nyloncoil type zippers

OTOH
I tried this on my HG Concord jacket Thursday night  Really I just
made a tinyadjustment type of squeeze  Really

Is was   your HG zipper the nyloncoil type or the kind with
molded plastic teeth I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type and
it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem I found I was overdoing
it no broken parts but the zipper was too hard to pull so after
spreading the zipper pull jaws again I tried with ViceGrips No not
the usual Grip Of Death technique I adjusted the closed ViceGrips so
they were snug on the zipper jaws then released them and tightened the
adjusting screw a bit A couple of iterations and I had just the right
amount of Zipper Squish TM

Result I now know that noplace in Spokane will even consider trying
to repair a broken zippercloserthingy which must be a  part
which needs a  tool to install

I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit actually on the
Accessory Ellipse and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of
charge I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses but parts ARE
available for YKK's plastic zippers Replacement was pretty simple just
break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
the pull from coming off the top end Slide on the new zipper pull Then
crimp on ViceGrips again a replacement zipper stop

You might try fabric stores  such and see if they sell replacement
parts

Oh for what it's worth the coiltype zippers on the Eclipse tankbag
are also YKK

 This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to
 a psychological norm that may not actually apply to a particular dog
 I've tried it with some success before but it won't work on a Charlie Manson
 dog or one that's really really stupid  A large Irish Setter taught me
 this in my yard apparently HIS territory one day  I'm sure he was playing 
 a game with me  The game was probably Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor Before 
 He Can Dispense the TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT
 
 What a dog weighs lb maybe at max You can't handle it

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational
constant that day  the closer I got to those exposed fangs still dripping
no doubt with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine
psychology the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become  Also 
recall that the distribution of the lb is one five pound jawteeth 
operated by two lb muscles driven by a  ounce brain possessing an
instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger
The other  lb is of course dog poop but that varies all over the place 
as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended 
lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors whilst continuously replenishing its
inexhaustible supply no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me

 You have I presume thumbs Grapple with it and tear it's head
 off

My very thought at the time but as I looked down at these once formidable 
instruments of mayhem I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too
many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomicallycorrect CRT keyboard
There was only one option left I reached down to the toolbox near my
car and grasped my Craftsman  ftlb torque wrench surely the bludgeon
of dire necessity if ever there was one  To my amazement and
confusion the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass then leapt
to its feet and vanished down the street still quivering and occasionally 
looking back at me  

Seven at One Blow I exclaimed flexing my newfound biceps and brandishing
my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the nowsecure environs
of my domicile  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently
knew all along the wrench was defective would no longer measure torque
accurately and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it  What I had interpreted
as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt

 Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
 we have all the advantages

Exactly nobody can look quite as silly as we can

 lottohuscharvardedu Jerry Lotto writes
 
 The understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among
 the accidentinvolved riders in the Hurt study
 
 The average rider does not identify that countersteering alone
 provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves
 even after many years of practice
 
 I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs But did the Hurt
 study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure
 to swerve In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen riders
 will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare simply because
 the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it overrides
 everything else Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
 manouvres  did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable

Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong 
as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger  Hurt
found that a surprising number of accidentinvolved motorcyclists hadn't
used their brakes at all prior to impact  

I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in 
a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you
ever use and to practice it constantly even when you have no need to do
any turning  If you follow me down a long straight and I seem to be 
wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need it's because
I'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in
my path  All of this practice may indeed be futile but if I have even
milliseconds to react the most familiar tactic available and hopefully 
the most automatic will be countersteering  The same logic applies to braking
with the front brake of course

I am looking for a new tank bag now and I wondered if you as follow 
FJ owners could make some suggestions as to what has and has
not worked for you 
With the FJ's large flat gas tank I'd imagine that almost anything
would work Personally I'm quite happy with my Eclipse standard tank
bag

Me too Even after I bought the piece Krauser K set  Now and then 
DK puts them on sale for  bux or so to clear out inventory but they
never seem to to go away  They are the Volkswagens of tank bags I guess

BTW the late Paul O' Neill showed me a trick with a pair of pliers that
will extend their life considerably  When the zipper starts to separate
behind the pull because of age and wear squash the pull body with the
pliers just a bit to tighten it back up  I would have tossed my bag three 
years ago but this fixed it up and kept it secure and reliable

 And still we wonder why they stereotype us
 
 Erc
 
  Whacha mean 'we'ifin they whom ever 'they' are want to stereotype me
 as one that likes to drink beer and watch lovely ladies display their
 beautiful bodies  I like that stereotype
   If you were refering 'stereotype' to infer a negative  you noticed we
 didn't rape pillage or burn down the town We also left mucho bucks as in
 MONEY with the town Me thinks the town LIKES us Least they said so
                          Lynn Hall  NOS Bros
 
 
 They bein' themfolk who tend to compose fair piece of the population
 bein the ones that regard bikers as a loud irresponsible irreverent
 reprobate rabble  

Doesn't sound like they attended though does it  In fact if we riders
need friends it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from 
Lynn's description especially if the same crowd gets invited back
to party some more year after year

 Sure you didn't rape and pillage It's a relief to know that you were
 such gentlemen but because you were not completely outofhand you 
 justify your lesser indescretions  Some pretty distorted thinking I
 should say  

You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these lesser
indiscretions  If the townspeople aren't ruffled by the
indiscretions and the partyers aren't either maybe the indiscretions
don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless 
goodnatured rowdiness among consenting adults  The only thing that 
really bothered me about the description was the kneedeep empty beer cans 
in the street but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they 
helped set up the party in the first place  If I lived there and the
bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
and good intentions I'd certainly rather they stick around and party
than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed

 Oh I'm sorry I just noticed that you left mucho bucks as in MONEY
 Nevermind my criticism I was out of line  I forgot that when one leaves
 mucho bucks as in MONEY their behavior is permissable perhaps even 
 justified

If it doesn't hurt anyone and all the parties to the party benefit
and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless then who 
needs to permit or justify it  You  Why do you need to do that

 Keep in mind that themfolks are the ones that could give a  when 
 a biker gets killed when their elected officials institute further
 draconian legislation helmet laws gun controls etc the ones that don't 
 respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all the
 rest of the time

Ironically these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe  They've developed a
friendly longterm mutuallybeneficial relationship with a group of 
motorcyclists and aren't as burdened with MCignorance as is the general
population because of it

 Need I continue

If such a need exists it surely must come from within

 So continue to wear your stigma as a badge but the next time you are
 whining about them and the effect of their values on yours remember
 that it was probably the behavior of selfrighteous wusses like myself
 that kept them at bay for this long

Well you got the selfrighteous wusses part right anyway

Car accessory shops here sell stuff called TCut which is a very fine
cutting paste for paint and this will remove the dull finish and
minor acratches It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that
you probably don't realise is there and give your paintwork its original
lustre and shine It can sometimes react badly with metallic paint though
so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff Afterwards
apply wax polish and all will be well again

BTW  don't confuse Tcut with the cutting paste used for grinding in 
valvesthe principle's the same but the coarseness is vastly different

	HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR  IN A 


Poppy cock  This story is obviously a complete fabrication and I'll show
you why

	In Ames there is a road that leads to the little town of
           
This establishes that the story takes place in Iowa
Gilbert  Gilbert has one stop light if that tells you something
Having just gotten the bike back together I thought I'd take it
for a short ride and check things out  Heading out of town I
went into the twisties at a slow pace just under the speed limit
               
In Iowa  Come on now Dan how dumb do you think we are  You could
have at least thrown in a llama or tennis ball reference  Hell you
didn't even get the speed right

Maybe you had accidentally sealed in some water  I cleaned my chain

hear screeching tires  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the 
moroon flying up right behind me in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the
bike  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel
I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions

The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in
gear  I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and
stall my bike  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that
I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time
needed to put the bike in gear

So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making splitsecond
evasive manuvers  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line
Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country  If I can't
split perhaps there isn't room then I will stop near one side of the
lane so I have an easy escape and leave my bike in gear until the next
car has stopped  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure
it will  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to
stop I haven't had to find out yet  Some cars have an annoying habbit
of racing up behind you before braking heavilly so it can be hard to
tell if they are planning to brake or not

So in summary position yourself for an easy exit and then watch your
mirrors until it's all clear

    I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle and to
put it bluntly it sucks  I really would like some advice on what would
be a good starter bike for me  I do know one thing however I need to
make my first bike a good one because buying a second any time soon is
out of the question  I am specifically interested in racing bikes CBR
 F GSXR   I know that this may sound kind of crazy
considering that I've never had a bike before but I am responsible a
fast learner and in love  

Responsible and in love  I believe that's a contradiction
in terms

Unless you're really brave read reckless a cc sport
bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first
year of riding  Getting more than that really is overkill
as you'll never even want to use it  The following bikes
can be bought and repaired cheaply are easy for a novice
to manage and are plenty high performance
    Kawasaki EX
    Honda VF Interceptor
    Suzuki GSE

The mph time of the EX at full throttle is way
sooner than you're ready for it    With something
as small as a  you'd probably be wishing for more
power pretty quickly unless it's a TZR or RGV 

Now I'm not saying that you're  certain to kill
yourself immediately with a f or a GSXR  Plenty
of people have started riding on those bikes and done
just fine  What I am saying is that it's a waste of
money and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping
You'll never get the throttle more than half open
anyway so why spend the extra  bucks

If you're planning to use TCutBE CAREFUL Sunlight fades paint and TCut removes the surface layer so if its a older bike or very sunny where

Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive

Mike Terry
' Virago

I've seen 'em but the real question is can one do a wheelie on a Lead Wing
If so how high would the front wheel be off the ground

 Wheelies on Lead Wings are possible but they ain't easy or so my
hhmmm what is the relation great uncle several times removed tells
me  As for how high how high do you want 'em  Modulation isn't
exactly the easiest thing in the world or so says a guy  years old

Well apparently once you get past about  inches all the luggage shifts back in the panniers the passenger slides back and the dog ends up hanging onto the top rack
and they go all the way over until it's flat on it's ass with the front wheel
straight up in the sky  Impressive but hard on the tail lights

I read that GM wants to keep the Design part of Lotus but lose the car

was caused by GM's insistence that the Elan be redesigned significantly

This summer July  my wife Michelle and I will be in Boston
attending my brother's wedding  After the wedding we are planning
to motor up to Bar Harbor Maine to visit some relatives for a few
days  Our summer would be made if we could find a bike or bikes
to borrow or rent to ride up to Bar Harbor and back

Here's some important details  I've been riding for  years
my own bikes for the past  years Michelle has been riding for the
past  years her own bikes I've only been involved in one accident
which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign I currently own
a BMW R Michelle owns a Yamaha Virago  we prefer cruising over
racing we've toured a fair amount we're both licensed and insured
and we're nice people

So if anyone has a bike or bikes  but the second one would have
to be a Virago or something else with an equally low seat that they
would be willing to loan us for  days in July Michelle and I would
be eternally grateful In addition to our friendship you would also
have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis
In exchange we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner
and an evening of wild bike stories or we might even be willing to
cough up some money for improvements to the bikes like new tires or
something

Also any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would be
greatly appreciated

Thanks

wanted to see what the new ones were going for so we happened upon a dealer
that sold both Suzuki and Yamaha 

The place was fairly busy so we browsed a bit We happened upon a few 
Intruders most of which had SOLD signs on My friend had been bitten

Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat I 
moseid on outside The next thing I know I see  or  sport bikes pull in
I could stereotype the type of riders backward ball hat oakley IQ 
but I won't Well they went inside I didn't think much of it I figured
to each his own I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs
firmly implanted into my friends back  when I noticed the hormone gang
talking to other salesdroidsmanagers Lot's of laughter jokes etc No big
deal

Here is the part that concerned me The HG and those shop personel that were
not busy with customers went back out where said HG members fired up their
rides and did the obligatory reving up of those  beasts At this point
one decided to see how much rubber  a Katana  could deposit in the drive

SQUIDS I thought to myself BUT I was appalled that the salesdroidsmanager
not only condoned this behavior but encourged it to the point were they
were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely
as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike seemed rather hormonal about this display and urged her
pilot to quickly catch up The others followed making sure there Kerkers
could be heard as well as felt

I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist I felt the eyes of those
in cages witnessing this display then glancing over to the dealers lot and
damning all those on two wheels Needless to say my friend felt a little
uncomfortable and we left 

I will now turn off my frustration and go ride peacefully to clear my
anger I only hope that the cop who is following me home has an open
mind and doesn't associate me with them 

BTW I can't afford a new bike

All our local 'experts' say it's the tappits that need some adjusting so
I am soon to attempt that  I would like any advice anyone had  I do
not have a shop manual but have read about the procedure in Chiltons and
in a few other places  Is there anything I need to be particularaly
carful of  Any problems anyone else has encountered

I would stongly recommend a factory service manual and if you are not
an experienced machanic then get a chiltons or haynes sp ALSO
Make sure the bike has cooled at least  hours since being run
Read the books and if you have more questions you could mail me
Also be very careful when tightening valve cover bolts  They take
very little torque and breaking one is disaster

Yup Do it whenever I am in the cage which is not often if its riding weather
 ie no snow I find arm out and down and kinda finger wave works best for
sport bikes and arm outup works best for Harleys Similar to how I wave when
I am on the bike

Let's see how many posts it takes for someone to selectively quote this article

ed  All of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand

Maybe they are riding around an everdecreasing circle of lies which
eventually leads to the truth



meThe official line here though I do have my doubts about it is that the
mefront brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being
methat you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place 

If that's the official line taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to that also don't teach countersteering I have to
question the quality of the classes 

Me too though unfortunately the Official Line is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence The examiner's
guidelines are laid down by the government and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them It surprises me that none of the
rider groups here either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass that the front brake must be applied before the rear that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time instead of just
when it is justified  there's probably a few more too which I can't
think of for the moment If the riding test could be rejigged a bit 
to include more of the realworld survival skills and less of the 
woefully simplistic crap that it contains now then the accident figures
would imho reduce still further

Don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though

my car driving test I now travel from Littlehampton to Brighton every day
and I'm getting PISSED off with the trafficroad works I thinking about getting
a cc bike  Don't Laugh  just to get Streetwise and to take my test then
to get a bigger one   to  cc 

	Now I have been told I don't have to do the CBT but what will I have
to do to get a full licence

Okay here's what to do   Get a drill and a sanding disk Use say a

coarse steel wool and brake fluid  Dot  has an uncanny knack for removing

A few months ago in one the the motorcycle mags there was
an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to
be available thru BMW  The idea was that the tape would look
black in sunlight and reflect in other colors at night to


Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source


Terry McCandlish president of my local BMW club Buckeye Beemers
sells this type of tape  It comes as a strip approximately  x 
and can be cut to sizes needed

You can call Terry at   Columbus Ohio

Summary light switch allows dual use of high and low beams

I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment
of other nedod folks when Dean Cookson  yes he has not left the 
country yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR 
shows that  the light switch is a three position switch 

high beam
low beam
Both beams

Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
 position switch but sure enough as Deam expected  when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on

This provides a very nice light coverage of the road

This is true for the St and the VFR and I would expect for any 
other late model Honda with the standard two position light switch

Thanks to Dean for reading the schematics try it you'll like it

	Be a bit careful doing this I used to balance the switch on my GSB
avec Cibie' H insert so that both beams were on  I eventually fried the
main ignition switch as it wasn't designed to pass that sort of current

Shaft Bamboozle beat beguile burn or flame deceive hoax

Drive Campaign crusade push

So 'shaft drive' may be a campaign to decieve or a crusade of beguile
efforts where are true to the spirit of this list

Wheel revolution swing

Crusaders of beguile are innefective in revolutions and they cannot
swing either therefore shaft drives cannot do wheelies

I am in hte market for a new bike been without for a few years
The two main bikes I'm looking at seriously are
The Yamaha Virago  and the Honda Shadow VLX  
I am leaning towards the Yamaha for its shaft drive the Honda is Chain
Insurance in Fla is more costly than I thought so I am staying in this
power range Thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences

A friend of mine who's probably reading this right now just bought a new
Yamaha Virago   After spending  hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts had to remove the right peg loosen
the brake pedal c c I've pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oilfilter
for me  Compared to the minute change he was used to for his Honda this
is just a design flawoversight in my eyes

I need help getting my ZX C to behave  I've managed to get
the front suspension to be very happy but the rear sucks  I can't
do anything with it to make it feel ok  The bike is very stable
through the corners I think because I have the front just right
but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous  It feels
like it actually amplifies the bumps  And the damping doesn't seem
to do anything in reallife although you can tell the difference
when the bike isn't moving  I've tried  cm of sag from
completeley unloaded but I don't know which way to go  Has anyone
gotten the rear of this bike comfortable  And if so what kind of
settings esp what sag did you use  I like to corner but I also
would like my kidneys to remain intact  This thing makes the new
ZX feel comfy

     Quite right your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
most of their charge if drained and dried well but I'd throw out the
electrolyte and buy some more when you need it


     And before anyone says I'm wrong remember that new batteries almost
always come ready charged and dry and they are perfectly OK even after
several years' storage at the shop

there are jerks on this newsgroup same as any other but if you've been 
lurking for a while you already know that  You might get lots of flames
if you try to convince people that you know more than them just because you
have a badge  And of course you will get a moderate amount of flamage
just for expressing an opinion no matter what the opinion is somebody
will flame you for it

 I plan to switch to a single fire ignition in about a month and was
 curious if anyone has experience with the supposedly new Crane single
 fire that competes with the DynaS  The club wrench not the wench has
 done DynaS modules for several friends and I'll get one also unless
 a bunch of folks say the Crane is better
 
 One guy just installed the MC Power Arc ignition but has not yet
 reported the results  It was not a simple boltin replacement as new 
 mounting holes had to be drilled
 
 I recognize it's more fun to discuss why Chris needed to change brands of
 penis enhancer but how 'bout some comments on single fire ignitions for
 a while

I just installed a MC Power Arc II and it seems to run great I also
used MC coils and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my  FXSTC A little soldering
and all was fine Static timing was real easy to set too 

On the other side of the coin my local wrench whose opinion I
invariably seek but don't always adopt thinks MC Power Arc is a piece
of shit and says all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day 
Needless to say he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules and
recommends the DynaS system I think that's the one with the
Halleffect timing sensors correct

Reminds me of a great editorial by Bruce Reeve a couple months ago
in Cycle Canada

He was so pissed off with cops pulling over speeders in dangerous
spots and often blind corners that one day he decided to get
revenge

Cruising on a factory loaner ZZR test bike he noticed a cop 
had pulled over a motorist on an on or off ramp with almost no
shoulder  Being a bright lad he hit his bike's kill switch
just before passing the cop who happened to be bending towards
the offending motorist thereby exposing his glutes to the
passing world

With his ignition system now dead he pumped his throtle two
or three times to fill his exhaust canister's with volatile raw fuel

All it took was a stab at the kill switch to relight the ignition
and send a ' flame in Sargeant Swell's direction

I wonder if any cycle cops read Cycle Canada

	Although I agree with the spirit of the action I do hope that
the rider ponied up the  or so it takes to replace the exhaust system
he just destroyed  The owner's manual explicitly warns against such
behavior for exactly that reason  you can destroy your muflers that way

One more good reason for straight pipes or megaphones

Hello Folks

I'm very happy with my new RGS  My range is  miles on  gallons
that's  mpg  Surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  I was expecting
something rough   She's a sweet backroad honey  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike  As far as shaft effect it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  Rev it sitting still
when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  Maybe

If the clutch is in then a large chunk of counterrotating mass is not
rotating  Hence at a light reving makes it twist  Shaft effect is the
rear end rising under power or the real problem getting lower to the road
when the throttle is snapped shut say when you are cornering and the heads
are real close to the road  New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have
almost no shaft effect

I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence  Okay here are 
my questions

 Any recommendations for a homemade fairing  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest and perhaps my helmet for comfort at highway speeds
 mph yet don't want to a screw up the stability or b block my
vision too much for trail riding  Anybody have luck with twopiece 
detachible fairings  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas

 I run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar  The illumination's excellent that way with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it 
really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM  

It's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the
extra light  At low RPM K and under they don't charge all that much if
at all  The alternators put out sufficient wattage it just that you need
to be at K RPM to get it  

 This is embarassing I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning  I invariably flood the carbs then go in and read a section
of the paper and then she starts right up  Is this a Zen thing 

Full choke  Open the gas taps  Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the
throttle  It should fire  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle
My R likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle

It's an EXPERIENCE thing  Like Zen it's hard to describe  It can be hard
to learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success
and failure  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the
battery while trying to get it to run

If my bike has been sitting for a few weeks I give it a short while to
start  If it doesn't I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to
vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off  I've got dual
plugs which make it easier to start

 The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives Yeah right  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best  Additives

The BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit  It's good for a few MPG and the
parts are alcohol proof  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof  As
long as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time gasohol is
nice since it helps keep ping away  If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas
you ought to raise the compression Half a smiley the BMW twins of the
s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy  Dual plugs
and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance

I'm just starting out with motorcycles  I've read up on the subject a bit
talked to many of my friends who ownride bikes and encourage me to do the
same  But when I ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at i get
varied answers


I'm ' about  largeathletic build  I suppose that would help to
determine the size bike i'd want  I want something that's going to be fast and
powerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once i'm used to it  I also want
something that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out  Any ideas

WARNING WARNING MAY CAUSE UNPLEASANTNESS

In article CrBCworldstdcom davedworldstdcom Dave T Dorfman writes
 I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment
of other nedod folks when Dean Cookson  yes he has not left the 
country yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR 
shows that  the light switch is a three position switch 

high beam
low beam
Both beams


Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
 position switch but sure enough as Deam expected  when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on

This provides a very nice light coverage of the
road

This is true for the St and the VFR and I would expect for any 
other late model Honda with the standard two position light switch


It's a make before break type of switch  If not required it ought to be
for highlow beams  

There might be a wee problem with this  If you use both filaments at the
same time the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal
Possibly enough to shorten it's life span  My Honda CRX cage a cage that
really wanted to be a bike had wimpy stock lights  So we used to run
around with both beams on  Made a mucho big difference  until both low
beam filaments died nearly simultaneously  This was two weeks after
finding out how nice it was to use both beams  I replaced the lights with
quartzhalogen lights and that ended the problem

If so how high would the front wheel be off the ground

My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run
A big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried 
to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me He kicked the dog a 
couple of times we were all only going about mph and just made the dog
angrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started
after yours truly At the time I had open drag pipes obnoxiously loud as hell
and as soon as the dog was about  feet away from the right side of my bike I
pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about rpm and the roar of
the pipes frightened the dog away probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell
and he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either 

My second encounter was with an already deceased roadkill dog I wasn't paying 
very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the
carcass I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I 
just held onto the handlebars and freaked out Both wheels went squarely over
the dog's belly with a thumpthump just like running over a piece of a x
lumber The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going After
I got to my destination I found bits of fur meat and blood stuck to
the bottom of my motor and frame gross

Another good place for your helmet is your mirror  I kid you not If
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable 

BUTT BUTT THEN YU WNT BE ABLE T EE THE CAR NEAKG UP BEHIND YU AND
PP A WHHHEEEEELLLLEEEEE T DTCHUM AND THE CHICK DIG IT

Seriously though putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because
you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam
liner that is expected to cushion your noggin  And once crushed that
foam never pops back

A variation of mirror hanging thing is what I do with the bike on the
sidestand hey the centerstand is for maintenance I turn the wheel to
the stop left and can hang the helmet by the chinbar on the right
grip  There is no crushable foam in the chinbar and it is pretty
secure on there as long as the forks are locked  If I have to leave
the helmet with the parked bike and the bags aren't onfull that is
about the most stable place

Also known as leaning

Say you want to turn left
severely confused rambling about the ground pushing

Contersteering refers to pushing the inside handlebar to effect a

After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD
Slash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs which I had been planning to
do anyway went to a different in spection station and passed with no
problem at about  dB

Two points

First I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly 
Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the dB level So if any other NH riders need to get this done make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body

Second these Bub pipes are bloody terrific At low revs or cruising
through town they as quiet as the stock pipes but have a sound thats
a more throaty purring rumble  When you open her up to  RPM
they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar Best of both worlds

      Quite right your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
 most of their charge if drained and dried well but I'd throw out the
 electrolyte and buy some more when you need it

 always come ready charged and dry and they are perfectly OK even after
 several years' storage at the shop

Quick question

What are the advantages of slipon's versus your stock exhaust versus
aftermarket exhaust systems I don't see many people using slipon's
but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive

Thanks
Dave


Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less Also in most 
instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more 
performance I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on
The midrange performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 
K rpm After talking to Kaz Yoshima the developer and manufacturer of 
the slip on he thinks I might need larger pilot idle jets Was not suppose
to but maybe where I live makes a difference Altitude barometric pressure
Anyway besides that minor glitch I like the slip on performance and the sound
which is louder than stock but not loud enough to annoy folks The Ontario 
slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full 
throttle

Just remember every bike is a tuned system When you change the intake or
exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer you may
have to change other areas to compensate Like a complete change of the exhaust
system header and muffler changes the exhaust characteristic to the point
which rejetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathingpumping
profile

Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if
they have used it on your particular bike Check with people who have the
system also to see what they think about there slip on

Also as a last data point in Sport Rider's first issue did a review on a
group of header and exhaust systems for the CBRF They also included as a 
side bar the Ontario slip on the Dyno showed an increase from stock of bhp at
the rear wheel  verses  

Buyer beware of outrageous claimed increases in horse power It may have been 
true in the past but not today

It sure would be nice if someone would start making replacements
for OEM exhausts that were would be cheaper but not louder

I read about a SuperTrapp system called EAR that was supposed to be
quiet enough to pass some European standards  Apparently it's not
on the market yet

Yoshimura makes a few systems that are supposed to be kind of quiet
They are also really light  I'm planning on getting one of these 
systems soon and will post the results

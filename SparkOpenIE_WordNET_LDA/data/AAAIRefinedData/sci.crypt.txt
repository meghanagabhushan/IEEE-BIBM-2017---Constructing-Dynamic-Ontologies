QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


  What is RIPEM

 RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail PEM using
 the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES  It allows your
 electronic mail to have the properties of authentication ie who
 sent it can be confirmed and privacy ie nobody can read it except
 the intended recipient

 RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan mrrscssclmsuedu
 Most of the code is in the public domain except for the RSA routines
 which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc

  How can I get RIPEM

 RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF which is
 considered munitions and thus is exportrestricted from distribution
 to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the US or
 Canada  Therefore the following request is quoted from the README
 file

 Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
 outside of the USA or Canada  This is a personal request from me
 the author of RIPEM and a condition of your use of RIPEM

 Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain and a license for it is
 included with the distribution  You should read it before using
 RIPEM

 The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy since this will
 reduce the load on those sites that do carry it not to mention the
 humans that run them  Naturally this requires that you trust the
 friend

 RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents
 in the US from rsacom cd to rsaref and read the README file for
 info  Last I looked this site contains only the source tree and
 does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version

 RIPEM as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on
 rpubclmsuedu which is open to nonanonymous FTP for users in the
 US and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents  To find out
 how to obtain access ftp there cd to pubcrypt and read the file
 GETTINGACCESS  For convenience binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree

  Will RIPEM run on my machine

 Probably  It has already been ported to MSDOS and most flavors of
 Unix SunOS NeXT Linux AIX ULTRIX Solaris etc  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIXstyle port and a rather nice
 Maclike port written by Raymond Lau author of StuffIt  More ports
 are expected and help of users is invited

  Will RIPEM work with my mailer

 Probably  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though  The users
 guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use RIPEM
 with many popular mailers including Berkeley mush Elm and MH
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU
 Emacs

 If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one
 in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure
 and may be useful to others feel free to post it to altsecurityripem

  What is RSA

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric or publickey  This means
 that there are two different related keys one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt  Because one cannot reasonably be derived from the other
 you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your
 decryption or private key to yourself  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it  Note that the message sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real message See What is DES

 Note that the above only provides for privacy  For authentication
 the fingerprint of the message See What is a fingerprint like
 MD is encrypted with the sender's private key  The recipient can
 use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message
 must have come from the sender

 RSA was named for the three men Rivest Shamir and Adleman who
 invented it  To find out more about RSA ftp to rsacom and look in
 pubfaq or look in scicrypt

  What is DES

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard a widely used symmetric or
 secretkey crypto system  Unlike RSA DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages  However DES is much faster than RSA

 RIPEM uses both DES and RSA it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards  However it
 should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency  It is not unlikely that future
 RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by using
 multiple encryption with DES

  What is PEM and how does RIPEM relate

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail a system for allowing easy transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail  It is described in RFCs  these
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 

 RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys which RIPEM does not
 handle at this time  Their addition is planned

  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know
 your public key  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her you must know her public key  It is important
 that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read

 RIPEM allows for three methods of key management a central server
 the distributed finger servers and a flat file  All three are
 described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution
 None of them provide perfect security

  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar

 RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various
 characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in
 your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys
 This does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the
 same class of key were generated with the same program are of the
 same length etc

  What is a fingerprint like MD

 MD is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc
 It provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash
 of the plaintext  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint  Thus
 instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key
 only the MD of the message needs to be signed for authentication

 MD is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to  bits of data as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator

 MD is described in its entirety including an implementation in C in
 RFC 

  What is PGP

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy
 PGP has been around longer than RIPEM and works somewhat differently
 PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way though PGP does also use RSA

 Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM

  PGP has more key management features particularly for users without
   a direct network connection

  RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of
   working with other PEM software  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible
   with anything other than PGP in fact PGP  is not compatible with
   PGP 

  RIPEM uses RSAREF a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security
   Inc  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use
   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed thus
   PKP the firm holding the US patents on the RSA algorithm claims
   that it is a infringement of that patent to make use or sell PGP in
   the US or Canada  In acknowledgement of this PGP's original
   author Phil Zimmermann says in the documentation

   In fact if you live in the USA and you are not a Federal agency 
   you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer because Public
   Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software  PGP is
   contraband  

  Both PGP and RIPEM are exportrestricted and cannot be sent outside
   the US and Canada  However PGP already exists on many ftp sites
   in Europe and other places

 Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues

 Note that the above facts both regarding patent and export
 restrictions are somewhat controversial many people think it
 shouldn't be that way and some people interpret various documents
 differently  Unfortunately discussions of it on the net inevitably
 seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in
 misclegalcomputing  See  DISCLAIMER

  What about RPEM

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail  It was similar to RIPEM
 but used a publickey cipher invented by Rabin which is not RSA in
 an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA  It was written by Mark
 Riordan the same author as RIPEM

 Its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many
 including Rabin Public Key Partners PKP claimed that their patent
 was broad enough to cover any publickey cipher whose strength rested
 in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes not just RSA
 This claim is not universally accepted by any means but was not
 challenged for pragmatic reasons

 RPEM is not really used anymore  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP

  What is MIME

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions and is
 described in RFC   You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 compmailmime  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely
 clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type
 applicationxripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones  I
 hope some standards will emerge  Draft Internet documents exist on
 the matter

  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM

 You may wish to check the companion post ripemattacks which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and
 what procedures will minimize the risk  RIPEM's main weak area is
 probably key distribution

WHAT'S NEW

I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information  It
does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere but
it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and
some other stuff  The URL is httpcsindianaeduripemdirhtml

This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information
on patents and stuff like that  I've also reordered a few things to
have a more sensible ordering  I hope I don't have to edit this again
soon

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


  What is RIPEM

 RIPEM is a not yet complete but useful implementation of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail PEM  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the
 four security facilities provided by PEM disclosure protection
 optional originator authenticity message integrity measures and
 nonrepudiation of origin always  See What is PEM

 RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan mrrscssclmsuedu
 Most of the code is in the public domain except for the RSA routines
 which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc

 The current version of RIPEM is  the current version of the
 Macintosh port of RIPEM is 

  How can I get RIPEM

 RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF which is
 considered munitions and thus is exportrestricted from distribution
 to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the US or
 Canada without an export license  No such license has been obtained
 nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were
 shortened to  bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something
 weaker than DES  There are some suggestions that this situation may
 change now that Clinton is in office  The author requests in the
 README file that this law not be violated

 Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
 outside of the USA or Canada  This is a personal request from me
 the author of RIPEM and a condition of your use of RIPEM

 Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain and a license for it is
 included with the distribution  You should read it before using
 RIPEM

 RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
 residents in the US from rsacom cd to rsaref and read the README
 file for info  Note that the nonRSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a
 product of RSA Data Security Incorporated they merely are helping
 distribute it

 RIPEM as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on
 ripemmsuedu which is open to nonanonymous FTP for users in the
 US and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents  To find out
 how to obtain access FTP there cd to pubcrypt and read the file
 GETTINGACCESS  For convenience binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree

  Will RIPEM run on my machine

 Probably  It has already been ported to MSDOS and most flavors of
 Unix SunOS NeXT Linux AIX ULTRIX Solaris etc  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIXstyle port and a rather nice
 Maclike port written by Raymond Lau author of StuffIt  More ports
 are expected and help of users is invited

  Will RIPEM work with my mailer

 Probably  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though  The users
 guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use RIPEM
 with many popular mailers including Berkeley mush Elm and MH
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU
 Emacs

 If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one
 in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure
 and may be useful to others feel free to post it to altsecurityripem

  What is RSA

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric or publickey  This means
 that there are two different related keys one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt  Because one cannot reasonably be derived from the other
 you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your
 decryption or private key to yourself  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it  Note that the message sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real plaintext See What is DES

 Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection  For
 originator authenticity message integrity and nonrepudiation of
 origin services to be implemented the fingerprint of the message
 See What is a fingerprint like MD is encrypted with the
 sender's private key  The recipient or a disputeresolving
 authority can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm
 that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered

 RSA was named for the three men Rivest Shamir and Adleman who
 invented it  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography
 in general ftp to rsacom and look in pubfaq  Some information
 also may be in scicrypt

  What is DES

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard a widely used symmetric or
 secretkey crypto system  Unlike RSA DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages  However DES is much faster than RSA

 RIPEM uses both DES and RSA it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards  However it
 should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency  It is not likely that the PEM
 standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the
 near future because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be
 stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with
 interoperability

  What is a fingerprint like MD

 MD is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc
 It provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash
 of the plaintext  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint  Thus
 instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key
 only the MD of the message needs to be signed for authentication

 MDs can also be exchanged directly for authentication for example
 RIPEM public keys include an MD of the public key in the file so
 parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate
 channel merely need exchange MDs of keys and verify their accuracy

 MD is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to  bits of data as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator

 MD is described in its entirety including an implementation in C in
 RFC 

 There have been some recent suggestions that MD may not be as strong
 a hash as was originally believed presumably some other hash
 function will be used if this is accepted as true

  What is PEM

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail a standard for allowing transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a
 working group of experts  It is described in RFCs  these
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 

 RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys which RIPEM does not
 handle at this time  Their addition is planned

  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know
 your public key  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her you must know her public key  It is important
 that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read

 RIPEM allows for three methods of key management a central server
 the distributed finger servers and a flat file  All three are
 described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution
 None of them provide perfect security  The PEM standard calls for
 key management by certificates the addition of this feature to RIPEM
 is planned but chickenegg issues still exist

  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM

 This issue has been considered in the standards process  RFC 
 the specification for Internet standards has a discussion section
  on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be
 met for a patented method to be included in a standard  RFC 
 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering publickey
 cryptography

 This does not of course mean that all questions are settled or that
 everyone is in agreement  An interesting exchange on the use of
 patented algorithms in standards with regard to publickey
 cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive
 available via FTP ftpuunetdoclpf in the files bidzosletter
 and bidzosresponse  Amusingly the LPF files on ftpuunet are
 compressed with a patented algorithm

  What about RSADSIPKP

 RSA Data Security Inc RSADSI is a Californiabased company
 specializing in cryptographic technologies  Public Key Partners is a
 firm which holds exclusive sublicensing rights of the following US
 patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents

      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
      DiffieHellman No 

      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method HellmanMerkle No 

      Cryptographic Communications System and
      Method RSA No 

      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method HellmanPohlig No 

 PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key
 cryptography  The two businesses are rather closely related for
 example the same person Jim Bidzos is president of both of them
 PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of
 companies IBM DEC Motorola ATT Lotus for use in their
 products  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their
 patents

 RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than
 its use of the RSAREF library and for no reason other than its
 author's desire to see widespread use of publickey cryptography
 However after the ball started rolling people at RSADSI got
 interested  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site and some
 people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing
 code  RIPEM even won the Best Application Built on RSAREF in 
 award

  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar

 RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS PublicKey Cryptography
 Standards identifier describing various characteristics about the
 key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as
 those of lots of other people's keys  This does not mean your keys
 are similar but only that they are the same class of key were
 generated with the same program are of the same length etc

  What is PGP

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy
 PGP has been around longer than RIPEM and works somewhat differently
 PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way though PGP does also use RSA

 A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM

  PGP has more key management features particularly for users without
   a direct network connection

  RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability
   of working with other PEM software  PGP makes no attempt to be
   compatible with anything other than itself

  RIPEM uses RSAREF a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which
   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use  PGP uses its own
   implementation of RSA  PKP claims that it is a violation of its
   patents to make use or sell PGP in the US or Canada without
   either a license or written permission  See DISCLAIMER
   See What about RSADSIPKP  Phil Zimmermann the author of
   PGP stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal
   action he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged but
   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening
   in the future  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide

   In fact if you live in the USA and you are not a Federal agency 
   you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer because Public
   Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software  PGP is
   contraband

  Both PGP and RIPEM are exportrestricted and cannot be sent outside
   the US and Canada without an export license  However PGP
   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places

 Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues
 Unfortunately it's not distributed separately from the program
 which can be difficult to find in the US on FTP sites due to
 liability concerns

  What about RPEM

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail  It was similar to RIPEM
 but used a publickey cipher invented by Rabin which is not RSA in
 an attempt to avoid the patents on publickey systems  It was
 written by Mark Riordan who later wrote RIPEM

 Its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many
 including Rabin PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough
 to cover the cipher employed  This claim is not universally
 accepted but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons

 RPEM is not really used anymore  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP

  What is MIME

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions and is
 described in RFC   You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 compmailmime a FAQ exists on it  How PEM should interact with
 MIME is not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution
 of having a MIME type applicationxripem in order to send RIPEM
 messages as MIME ones  I hope some standards will emerge  Draft
 Internet documents exist on the matter

  What is TISPEM

 Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail for general availability  Last I heard it was
 rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent MH
 rather than a standalone system and in beta test  I don't know
 much more than that

  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM

 You may wish to check the companion post ripemattacks which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and
 what procedures will minimize the risk  RIPEM's main weak area is
 probably key distribution

SOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM


This is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open
for when using RIPEM for secure electronic mail  It does not go into
great detail and is almost certainly not exhaustive  Obviously many
of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in
general and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM
It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen mvanheyncsindianaedu  It
is posted monthly to a variety of news groups followups pertaining
specifically to RIPEM should go to altsecurityripem

CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS


 Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key
  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign
  messages with your private key

  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard
  cryptanalytic techniques  Even a standard key about  bits with
  RIPEM is long enough to render this impractical barring a
  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring

 Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message
  since the message itself is encrypted with DES  It would not allow
  an attacker to claim to be you

  DES has only  bits in its key and thus could conceivably be
  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies
  have such money to devote to simply read one message  Since each
  message has a different DES key the work for each message would
  remain high

KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS


 Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking
  RSA  To safeguard it it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived
  from a passphrase you type in  However if an attacker can get a copy
  of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snooping network
  packets tapping lines or whatever he could break the whole scheme

  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the
  private key file across an untrusted link  So don't do that  Run 
  RIPEM on a trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of
  you  Ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office
  which nobody else has physical access to

 Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could 
  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him
  rather than to the real recipient  If the enemy can fool your
  intended recipient as well he could reencrypt the messages with
  the other bogus public key and pass them along

  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people
  The most common mechanism for this is finger assuming the opponent
  has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be 
  given a fair amount of trust  The strongest method of key
  authentication is to exchange keys in person however this is
  not always practical  Having other people vouch for you by
  signing a statement containing your key is possible although 
  RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as
  PGP  RIPEM does generate and check MD fingerprints of public keys
  in the key files they may be exchanged via a separate channel for
  authentication

PLAYBACK ATTACKS


 Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could
  still cause difficulties  For example suppose you send a message
  with MICONLY a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection
  to Alice which says OK let's do that Your opponent intercepts
  it and now resends it to Bob who now has a message which is
  authenticated as from you telling him to do that  Of course he may
  interpret it in an entirely different context  Or your opponent
  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later
  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time  Or the
  opponent could change the OriginatorName to himself register 
  your public key as his and send a message hoping the recipient
  will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the
  unknown message

  To defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should 
  include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique
  identifier typically the date  A good frontend script for RIPEM
  should do this automatically IMHO  As a recipient you should be
  sure that the OriginatorName header and the sender indicated within
  the plaintext are the same that you really are a recipient and that
  the message is not an old one  Some this also can and should be
  automated  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at
  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated
  headers the programs are included in the standard distribution in
  the utils directory

LOCAL ATTACKS


 Clearly the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of
  the machine where the encryption is performed  For example under
  UNIX a superuser could manage to get at your encrypted mail
  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like
  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of
  the plaintext depending how it's stored

  In addition the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is
  an extension of that  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine
  which you are connected to via network or worse yet modem an
  eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your
  passphrase

  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust obviously  In
  the extreme case RIPEM should only be used on your own machine
  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access
  to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of
  viruses and so on  However there's a very real tradeoff between
  convenience and security here

  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation
  where other people have access even root access but increase
  security by keeping private keys and the statically linked of
  course executable on a floppy disk

  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multiuser system but when dialing
  in over an insecure line they will download the message to their
  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there  However the
  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory since
  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in you've just
  given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and
  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time
  you use it from a less insecure line  This will likely remain the
  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of
  cleartext password authentication

  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my
  security arrangement in my plan next to my public key so that
  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are
  in place  Some people use two keys a short one which is not
  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated
  with greater care for critical correspondence

UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS


 RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key
  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the
  traffic  However once someone with that key gets the message she
  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes  There 
  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking an
  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MICONLY message signed by
  you and readable by anyone although RIPEM does not provide this
  functionality  Indeed the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically
  states that such transformations should be possible to allow
  forwarding functions to work
 
  Including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will
  make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware
  of its original nature  Naturally the security of the cryptography
  can never be greater than the security of the people using it

There are many Urban Legends maybe this ought to be in the Crypt 
FAQ about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify 
magnetic media when used for classified data  Here is some 
information from the horse's mouth

Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media clearing meant to 
be retained within the controlled environment or declassifying 
the material to be reused outside the controlled environment

From National Telecommunications and Information Systems 
Security NTISS Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation 
Security Guidelines  NTISSAM COMPUSEC



 Clearing of Magnetic Media

Certain types of removable media eg magnetic tape floppy disk 
cassettes and magnetic cards may be cleared by overwriting the 
entire media one time with any one character  Floppy disks may be 
cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites 
each location with a given character

Fixed media eg Winchester disks should be cleared by overwriting 
at least one time with any one character  One way to do this is by 
applying a vendorsupplied formatting program that overwrites each 
location on the disk with a given character if it can be shown that 
this program actually works as advertised  The user should beware 
some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not 
actually do this

Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or 
released for destruction however they should be marked and 
controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of 
information ever recorded

 Declassification of Magnetic Media

Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a 
degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of 
that type  A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA

If a fixed medium for example a hard or Winchester disk is 
operative an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to 
employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all 
addressable locations at least three times by writing any character 
then its complement eg binary ones and binary zeros 
alternatively

When fixed  media become inoperative it is impossible to declassify 
the media by the overwrite method  In this case there are two 
alternate procedures that may be used  disassemble the disk 
pack and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved 
degaussing equipment and  courier the inoperative media to the 
vendor's facility have the magnetic media eg disk platter 
removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for 
destruction at the secure site  The vendor can then install new 
platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit

Lots of stuff

I hate to follow up to my own posting but I should perhaps clarify
some things so I won't get flamed

First of all when I'm talking about factoring the modulus'' or a
breakthrough in factoring'' what I really mean is a breakthrough in
the cryptanalysis of RSA  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are
not proven to be equivalent it's just so damn convenient not to
repeat this every time

I also have to admit that I don't really know if the nongroup''
property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining  I have
thought about it a little while but I can't find a way that a
cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure  That of course means
nothing at all

Then I wrote

Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus
than it is to generate it the increase in computer speed alone will
keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lockstep ie people will
simply start using longer moduli and still be safe

What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
cryptanalyst is a faster computer then we will probably have RSA for
a long time to come because even if bit moduli somehow could be
broken with fast computers not with a new algorithm then people
would simply use longer moduli  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit
from better technology in the same way

Hope this keeps the flames away  Have fun

This thread brings up the more general question  Can any crypto
implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not
available EVER be trusted

After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals
but before IBM had decided to respond I argued strenuously that they 
should not they should keep it proprietary 

The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr Lewis Branscomb  Dr Branscomb
was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS  Fortunately
for all of us Dr Branscomb understood the answer to the above question
much better than I  He realized how difficult it would be to gain
acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism  Because of the necessary
complexity publicity would not be sufficient and neither would 
authority  In fact it has taken both of those plus more than  
years

We have also had independence  The DES was solicited by NBS invented
and proposed by IBM and vetted by NBS  It has also been examined and
vetted by experts like Adi Shamir who are not subject to influence by
any of these

Even now there are still people posting on this list who do not trust
the DES in spite of all the time all of the analysis and all of the
public scrutiny

Of course it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to 
gain acceptance for a novel mechanism developed in secret on the basis
of authority alone

We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can break the
DES  That is a silly question  At some cost and in some time they
can break anything  The important question is at what cost and in
what time

The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important
as what we know about their strength  As long as we understand the
cost and duration for an attacker then we can use them in a safe way
At this point we may never replace either because of the inability of
any successor to overcome this knowledge gap

DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century
and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography
We are damned lucky to have them

tarnoldvnetIBMCOM Todd W Arnold said in article almadenibmcom
It's OK as long as you trust the enduser to stay out of your application
program  or as long as it runs in a system where the user can't get to it
Otherwise you can't stop him from finding the load a module code in your
program and simply bypassing the check for a valid module  The devious user
can either modify the object code before running the program or he can run
the program under a debugger and change the instructions in memory
There is a way to foil debuggers by clearing the single step 
interrupt on which a debugger depends every few instructions in 
the sensitive areas of the code

This assumes the person is using the hardware debug instruction of an X
type processor  It can be negated by NOP'ing the clear debug instruction
or by running the code on a machine simulator like one I wrote as a senior
project in college  It can bypass and trace practically anything one could
write in software  Kind of like being on a Star Trek Holideck

It is apparently quite easy to get hold of a person's calling records
through the phone company  Police and some lawyers are able to acquire
such information without any warrant or judicial supervision whether or
not the target is suspected of specific crimes

Pardon me but isn't this very illegal  I was under the impression that a
warrent is needed to get this information out of the phone company in
order to protect people's privacy 

Legal or not I've seen it done  Phone records were obtained
in order to establish probable cause rather than as a result of it
In other words for a fishing expedition

 
                                   A local Worcester MA police officer I
spoke with only a couple of nights ago told me that they usually only
subpeona the phone companies records in extreme conditions because it's so
much of a hassle

And does the phone company require written subpoenaable evidence
of probable cause in order to process the request  I suggest that
the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case  even if you
could prove the offender had called you at a certain time your 
chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence
are nil  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases
of extreme phone harassment several thousand calls in one case teaches 
me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters

 I will provide one hint it is reported that RSA expressed puzzlement at
 their conference that nobody has asked for permission to use RIPEM to
 write a PGPcompatible program

This actually supports Bill's speculation  IF there is a backdoor in
RSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA then it is more
than natural that they will welcome ANY publickey implementation that
uses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY
implementation that doesn't

I personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a
longprecision modular arithmetic library that comes in source but
of course the fact that I cannot see it means nothing

 It is interesting to note in this regard that permission to export
 PKZIP's encryption scheme has twice been denied by NSA  Draw you own
 conclusions

Uh I'm afraid that your information is slightly out of date PKWare
has obtained a license to export their program to the whole world
except a very limited list of countries Draw your own conclusions
about the strength of the algorithm

 There is no guarantee that the deleted space would be overwritten during
 optimization  Likely but no guarantee  A quicker and more secure method
 would be a batch file that overwrote all of your free space  For example
 fillbat
 	echo   out
 	fillbat
 This is off the top of my head  include stddisclaimerh

It is MUCH easier faster and probably even more secure to use Norton
Utilties  I'm talking IBM PC here and to tell WipeInfo to a
clean the free disk space and b clean the slack space at the end of
the files Use to Government standard option for more careful
overwriting

This actually supports Bill's speculation  IF there is a backdoor in
RSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA then it is more
than natural that they will welcome ANY publickey implementation that
uses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY
implementation that doesn't

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF I
do not believe that RSA would consent to such  

However there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which
NSA has an interest  It has an interest in a limited number of
implementations ie targets  It has an interest in fixed key or
maximum modulus size  

It has a legitimate literally right to pursue such interests  Within
bounds it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert
means  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose
all of its motives and intentions  Institutions are not selfaware
they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense

      I am looking for references to algorithms which can be used for
 password encryption Ie someone has a cleartext word runs it

 I want this algorithm to have the property that it is a next to
 impossible to reverse and b would take too long to try all possible
 words to see which one works even by use of a highspeed computer
 Please send references or ideas to mlevinhuscharvardedu

The original oneway encryption I put into Multics about  as suggested

by Joe Weizenbaum was invertible  An Air Force tiger team demonstrated 
this to me in May   I then asked an expert who requested anonymity 
what I should use instead the expert's suggestion was to treat the 
byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm 
which is similar or identical to DES  This method or something stronger 
should take care of a  Issue b is discussed in compsecuritymisc 
longer passwords and quality control on what users can choose as passwords
are the common tactics

For example if I had a program on my disk which created totally random
files looking like encrypted messages and could demonstrate that the file
in question could have been created by that program then my claim that
it was in fact created by that program must stand as true since I'm
innocent unless someone can prove me wrong

HMMM that brings up a neat idea  

Unfortunately it's SOOO neat I think I ought to patent it

So I can't tell you about it

Sorry

How about this  I create a bunch of sets of random data and encrypt it  I 
keep only one of the sets of random data around to show that I encypt random
data for kicks  The rest I delete with their keys  I tell all my friends
I think this establishes reasonable doubt about the contents of any encrypted
files and my ability to provides keys  Since anyone could do this any law
that forces a user to provide keys on demand is worthless

The law is much worse than worthless  It gives police the power to put
innocent people in jail because they the police find something they don't
understand  Most police don't know what the return key does never mind the
difference between a core file and classified military secrets

There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something
is either  It could be uninitialized junk  The burden of proof is on the
user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have  No
one should ever be put in that situation especially in America

What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it to
provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical alleged child molester
or drug dealer or whatever bad thing is in style at the time  Basically most
people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects

As an analogy it's like they find a loose screw in your house and they
insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun  They ask you where it came
from like you'd know and ask you to prove your claim  When you explain it
in such simple terms people may start to get the idea

As a matter of fact i do keep random files on my disk  The reason is
without specialpurpose hardware it takes a long time to generate good random
bits  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute which is
pretty conservative but over time that's more than i need

If you think about it there's no point in actually encrypting random data
because it just gives you different random data  If you want some data to
look like an encrypted file you just put an appropriate header on it  If
enough people do this some of them will be put in jail

When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys you can tell them it's
just random junk although of course they won't believe you  While you're
sitting in jail you can take consolation in the fact that the government will
burn a few CPUyears trying to find something that's not there

People have been encrypting notes in their notebooks for hundreds of years
 maybe over a thousand  It's a long tradition dating at least back to
the alchemists

I know of nothing bad happening to them  I would assume that nothing bad
would happen to you given this long history establishing encryption as

I guess we will have to wait for the time in the far future
when everyone uses such good crypto that the NSA has no job  Then the
agency will be disbanded and its files opened after the approprate
historical delay  

You've overlooked a fundamental Truth

	both headcount and budget of any government agency are
	monotonic increasing functions

Given that Truth you need to look for what the agency can do to occupy
all those people and spend all that money when crypto is unbreakable

Perhaps they could talk the world's telephone companies into making equipment
they could break into and tap

Maybe they could convince people that distributed computing was a good idea
so that even the internal state of a process would be available for access
by wiretapping

Maybe

This suggests a new PC security product design approach  first fill the hard
drive with  random files and  files encrypted under a number of known 
keys Then whenever a new secret file is created you delete a random file and
replace it with real encrypted data New nonsecret files are encrypted under
a known key

   Better yet instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system take
it a step further  Write yourself a minimal file system program that
is used to createdelete files endecrypt them to ramdisk list a
directory Put the util password protected on a floppy

   The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part
of the DOS file system  Instead defrag your disk thus packing all
allocated clusters into clusters n  Then use the back end of the
partition to hold your 'stealth' file system  Or leave a small nd
partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS  Another approach
might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files DOS
system files for instance  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage 
unit of a cluster there is unused physical space on the disk between
the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster These
dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file
system

   Now you have a situation where no encrypted data appears on your
disk at all

A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic
hash function eg MD when fed with a large amount of
moreorless random data For example running MD on devmem is a
slow but random enough source of random bits there are bound to be
 bits of entropy in the tens or hundreds of megabytes of data in
a modern workstation's memory as a fair amount of them are system

eg The police couldn't demand that you silently take them to where the
body is buried or where the money is hidden

But they can make you piss in a jar and possibly provide DNA semen
and hair samples or to undergo tests for gunpowder residues on your hand

BTW that was why the chemical engineer arrested in the WTC explosion
thrust his hands into a toilet filled with urine as the cops were breaking
down the door  the nitrogen in the urine would mask any residue from
explosives  I found it interesting the news reported his acts but not
his reasons

Somewhere perhaps a privacy group they discussed the legal ramifications
of using a password like

  I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden

a while back  The impression I got was that real judges would dismiss
arguments that this password is selfincrimination as firstyear law
school sophistry  the fact that you use a statement for a password has
no bearing on the veracity of that phrase

You are not being asked to incrimidate yourself eg where did you
bury the body you are being asked to provide information necessary
to execute a legal search warrant  Refusing to provide the password is
akin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker except that they
could always force their way into the locker

Of course that doesn't mean you have to help them understand what
they find or point out things they overlooked in their search

      Do a straight encryption of your keyrings and put the
        results with misleading names somewhere they won't be noticed
        eg in the windows directory nobody knows what half those
        files are

      Do a straight encryption of a BAT file that will decrypt
        the keyrings to RAMdisk and will set PGPPATH to point at it

      Set up another BAT file to decrypt and execute the first
        again on RAM disk Have it take the name of the target file
        as an argument so that there is no link between this file and
        the nonexistent batch file referred to by the rest of the
        system Comment it so it looks like a test script for fooling
        around with PGP Set PGPPATH to the PGP directory

      Leave the original keyrings that came with PGP in the
        directory with PGP a good indication that you are playing
        with but haven't made serious use of PGP Add a set of keys
        with your name and a really simple passphrase Never use it
        or use it as your widely published key for lowsecurity
        email

      When needed run the second BAT file Make sure all
        intermediate and plainfiles are generated on RAMdisk

From Mike Godwin mnemonicefforg posted with permission  Carl

Sadly it does not Suspects can be compelled to give handwriting and
voice exemplars and to take blood and DNA tests

 eg The police couldn't demand that you silently take them to where the
 body is buried or where the money is hidden

No but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where as it
happens evidence that will convict you is stored 

The cryptokey disclosure issue hasn't come up yet but current law
suggests that it's a loser for the defendanthe'll be compelled to turn
over the key

The test for compelled selfincrimination is whether the material to 
be disclosed in itself tends to inculpate the discloser In the example
I gave above the safe key itself has no testimonial valueergo it can
be disclosed under compulsion eg subpoena duces tecum

Moreover the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
keycompelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you Of course they
can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
you

Why do people insist on making unequivocal statements about that which

 But I don't guess PKP and RSA are interested in big bucks  Maybe
 they have some other agenda  Secure communications only for

nothing at all preventing the average citizen using it only selling
it

 
 I hope my cynicism is misplaced here  Go aheadI'm not afraid to
 be wrong every once in a while  But I have an uneasy feeling that I
 am right  

It is and you are wrong yet you emotionally state a bunch of crap as fact
with a tiny disclaimer at the end  Check your facts first and grow up
Why is there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography
and immaturity I wonder

IDENTITY



 What is identity' on the internet

  Generally today people's identity' on the internet is primarily
  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their
  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm   This is your
  login name qualified by the complete address domain information
  for example ldlongslancecolostateedu''  People see
  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you
  and in other situations where programs record usage  Some obsolete
  forms of addresses such as BITNET still persist

  In email messages additional information on the path that a message
  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient  This
  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the
  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination  This
  type of identifyandforward protocol is also used in the USENET
  protocol to a lesser extent  Forging these fields requires
  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and
  is very uncommon  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the
  origination point so that all initial sites in the list are faked
  at the time the message is created  Tracing these messages can be
  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of
  real machines and represent real transfer routes


 Why is identity unimportant on the internet

  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication
  privacy and security which in turn are all critical aspects of
  computer networks For example the convenience of communication
  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for
  identification  But there are many potential abuses of identity
  possible that can have very severe consequences with massive
  computer networks at the forefront of the issue which can
  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems

  Verifying that an identity is correct is called authentication'
  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is
  HGWell's War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled
  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was
  in progress  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and
  forged identities makes them more insidious  People and their
  reputations can be assaulted by forgery

  However the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of
  its most attractive features Identity is just as useful as it is
  harmful  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he
  finds he is talking to an undergraduate A person of a particular
  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally
  shun him  Some prejudices are erased but on the other hand many
  prejudices are useful  A scientist might argue he can better
  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more
  about the authors  Likewise he may be more likely to reject it
  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria  On the other side of the
  connection  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in
  exerting pressure for acceptance

  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating
  credit' not necessarily financial and ownership' and usage' 
  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques
  for identification Heavy reliance will be placed on digital
  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic 
  Many government functions and services are based on identification
  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it  Hence employees of
  many government organizations push toward stronger identification
  structures  But when does identification invade privacy

  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive
  proportions Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect
  many future users especially as the network becomes increasingly
  global universal widespread and entrenched and the positive or
  adverse affects of these actions intended and inadvertent  will
  literally be magnified exponentially


 How does my email address not identify me and my background

  Your email address may contain information that influences people's
  perceptions of your background  The address may identify' you as
  from a department at a particular university an employee at a
  company or a government worker  It may contain your last name
  initials or cryptic identification codes independent of both  In
  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers  Others
  are in the form 'u' where the number is incremented in the
  order that new users are added to the system

  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your
  broad geographical location or nationhood  However none of this
  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all  The
  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on
  rather arbitrary organization such as mostly invisible network
  cabling distributions  The only point to make is that early fields
  in the address are more specific such as specific computer names
  or local networks and the later ones the most general such as
  continental domains  Typically the first field is the name of the
  computer receiving mail

  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an
  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise  For more
  information see the FAQs on email  addresses and known
  geographical distributions below  However UNIX utilities exist
  to aid in the quest see the question on this

  Common Suffixes
  

  us    United States
  uk    United Kingdom
  ca    Canada
  fi    Finland
  au    Australia

  edu   university or college
  com   commercial organization
  org   'other' eg nonprofit organization
  gov   government
  mil   military site
 

 How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address

  One simple way is to send email to that address asking  Another
  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address ie
  postmasteraddress although the postmaster's job is more to help
  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve
  mail routing problems  The sysadmin ie rootaddress' may also
  be able to supply information  Users with related email address
  may have information  However all of these methods rely on the
  time and patience of others so use them minimally

  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the
  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'  The basic syntax is

    finger userherethereeverywhere

  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer
  named in the address for information on the user named  The
  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may
  be in any format  Possible responses are as follows

   A message unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is
    incorrect two lines with no information and ''
  
   A message 'In real life ' in which case the receiving computer
    could not find any kind of a match on the username The finger
    utility may return this response in other situations
  
   A listing of information associated with multiple users Some
    computers will search only for matching user IDs others will
    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all
    actual full names of users kept in a local database
  
  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the
  system with a finger address'  In general this is often
  considered weak security however because attackers' know valid
  user ID's to crack' passwords

  More information on the fields returned by finger' is given below 
  More information on finger' and locating people's email addresses
  is given in the email FAQ such as the WHOIS lookup utility  Just
  as you can use these means to find out about others they can use
  them to find out about you  You can finger' yourself to find out
  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you  Be
  careful when modifying finger' data virtually anyone with
  internet access worldwide can query this information  In one
  amazing case the New York Times writer J Markoff uncovered the
  identity of R Morris author of the Internet Worm  through
  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'  See the book Cyberspace
  by K Hafner and J Markoff


 Why is identification unstable on the internet

  Generally identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept
  on the Internet for a variety of reasons  One is the inherent
  fluidity of cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge
  frequently and absences are not readily noted in the community' 
  Most people remember faces and voices the primary means of casual
  identification in the 'real world'  The arbitary and cryptic 
  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are
  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique
  identification of an individual who may use multiple accounts on
  multiple machines anywhere in the world

  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances
  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to
  be A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an
  individual  
  
   Anyone with access to the account eg they know the password
    either legitimately or otherwise can send mail with that address
    in the From line
  
   Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as
    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations 

   As part of current mailing protocol standards forging the From
    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many
    hackers
    
  The status and path information prepended to messages by
  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable In general while
  possible forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in
  email  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic
  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification
  on the internet

   Internet mail standards described in RFC are still evolving
    rapidly and not entirely orderly  For example standards for
    mail address munging' or parsing' tend to vary slightly between
    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding
    addresses and bouncing mail
  
   Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites
    and there are delays in the propagation of this data
  
   Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers
    crash such as the receiving computer or other computers involved
    in resolving names into addresses called nameservers' 
  
   A whole slew of problems is associated with  nameservers' if
    they are not updated they will not find name addresses and even
    the operation of what constitutes updating' has different
    interpretations at different sites
  
  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly
  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was
  somewhat obscure and not widespread with only a fraction of the
  traffic it now sees  Today a large proportion of internet traffic
  is email comprising  millions of messages


 What is the future of identification on the internet

  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images
  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of
  community that comes from the familiarity of identification
  However they are not currently widespread require large amounts
  of data transfer standardized software and make some compromises
  in privacy

  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'
  and 'digital authentication' common see below  Also the trend
  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted
  information  On the other hand advances in ensuring anonymity
  such as remailers are forthcoming  See below


PRIVACY



 What is privacy' on the internet

  Generally while privacy' has multiple connotations in society and
  perhaps even more on the internet in cyberspace most take it to
  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the
  data stored on and and directed to it such as email and you do
  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches  In other words 
  others may obtain data associated with your account but not
  without your permission  These ideas are probably both fairly
  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users
  consider their private domains  Some users don't expect or want
  any privacy some expect and demand it


 Why is privacy unimportant on the internet

  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic arousing
  passionate opinions  On the internet some take privacy for
  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent
  Most governments have rules that protect privacy such as the
  illegal search and seizure clause of the US constitution adopted
  by others but have many that are antithetical to it such as laws
  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping These
  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules
  governing it  However the legal repercussions of the global
  internet are still largely unknown and untested ie no strong
  legal precedents and court cases  The fact that internet traffic
  frequently passes past international boundaries and is not
  centrally managed significantly complicates and strongly
  discourages its regulation


 How insecure are internet networks

   Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with
    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the
    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it However the
    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes
    these scenarios highly improbable even by government agencies
    with supposedly vast funding and resources
  
   Technologies exist to tap' magnetic fields given off by
    electrical wires without detection  Less obscurely any machine
    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic
    detection but this scenario requires knowledge and access to
    very lowlevel hardware the network card to pursue if even
    possible
  
   A company Network General Inc is one of many that manufactures
    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can
    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for
    troubleshooting purposes but the cost of this type of device is
    prohibitive for casual use

  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major
  scale such as at network hubs are very rare The greatest risks
  tend to emerge locally  Note that all these approaches are almost
  completely defused with the use of cryptography
    

 How insecure is my account

  By default not very  There are a multitude of factors that may
  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet 
  First your account must be secure from other users The universal
  system is to use a password but if it is weak' ie easy to
  guess this security is significantly diminished  Somewhat
  surprisingly and frighteningly to some certain  users of the
  system particularly the administrator generally have unlimited
  access regardless of passwords and may grant that access to
  others  This means that they may read any file in your account
  without detection

  Furthermore not universally known most UNIX systems keep fairly
  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in what
  commands you execute and when they are executed in fact login
  information is usually public Most features of this auditing' or
   process accounting' information are enabled by default after the
  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it
  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims 
  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting
  purposes and may otherwise be ignored  This data tracks
  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on
  the system A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user
  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of
  symbolic links described  in 'man ln'
  
  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features
  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies
  regularly Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX
  functionality with publicdomain programs and locallydeveloped
  tools for monitoring and use them only to isolate suspicious'
  activity as it arises eg remote accesses to the 'passwd' file incorrect
  login attempts remote connection attempts etc
  
  Generally you should expect little privacy on your account for
  various reasons
  
   Potentially every keystroke you type could be intercepted by
    someone else 

   System administrators make extensive backups that are completely
    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over
    many weeks 

   Erased files can under many operating systems be undeleted 

   Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or
    otherwise for example FTP sites usually log the commands and
    record the domain originations of users including anonymous
    ones

   Some software exacerbates these problems  See the section on
    X Windows insecurity''

  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users a much
  more commonly harmful threat There are multiple ways to help
  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others and
  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines

   Choose a secure password  Change it periodically
   Make sure to logout always
   Do not leave a machine unattended for long
   Make sure no one watches you when you type your password
   Avoid password references in email
   Be conservative in the use of the rhost file
   Use utilities like xlock' to protect a station but be
    considerate

  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your
  password  There are only several basic situations where UNIX
  prompts you for a password when you are logging in to a system or
  changing your password  Situations can arise in which prompts for
  passwords are forged by other users especially in cases where you
  are talking to them such as Internet Relay Chat  Also be  aware
  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain 
  passwords

 How insecure are my files and directories

  The most important privacy considerations are related to file
  rights and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature
  or haphazard maintenance Be aware of the rights associated with
  your files and directories in UNIX If the x' execute' right on
  your parent directory is off for users groups and other these
  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories 
  Anything less may allow others to read change or even delete
  files in your home directory The rights on a directory supersede
  the rights associated with files in that directory For a
  directory 'x' means that access to the files or subdirectories
  in the directory is possible  if you know their names  To list
  the contents of the directory however requires the 'r' right
 
  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner but the
  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator
  preference  The default file mode specifies the initial rights
  associated with newly created files and can be set in the shell
  with umask'  The details of rights implementations tend to vary
  between versions of UNIX  Consult man pages on chmod' and ls'

  Examples
  

    traverlance  ls ld 
    drwx  ld      Jan   usersld

  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home
  directory denoted by '  The columns at the left identify what
  rights are available The first column identifies the entry as a
  directory and the next three columns mean that read write and
  execute rights respectively are permitted for that user  For
  directories the x' right means that contents file and
  subdirectory names within that directory can be listed The
  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to
  anything in the directory tree originating at that point  They
  can't even see' any lower files or subdirectories the hierarchy
  is completely invisible to them

    traverlance  ls l msg
    rwrr   ld    Jan   msg
    traverlance  chmod urwgo msg
    traverlance  ls l msg
    rw   ld    Jan   msg

  Here the modes on the file msg' were changed to take away rights
  from group' and other' 
  
  Note that ls l file' requires both the 'r' right to get the list
  of files and subdirectories and the 'x' right to access the files
  and subdirectories in order to get their size etc For example
  suppose the directory foo' has rights drrr  the following
  is possible

    ls foo

  These commands would fail independent of file rights
  
    ls l foo
    ls l foofile
    cat foofile
    cd foo

  If the directory foo' has rights dxxx the following are
  possible if it is known beforehand that foo' contains an 'r'
  readable file named file'
  
    ls l foofile
    cat foofile
    cd foo
  
  The following commands fail
  
    ls foo
    ls l foo

 How insecure is X Windows

  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena
  project which is funded by US government grants to develop
  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing
  computational tasks particularly the humancomputer interface 
  The software implements a clientserver interface to a computer via
  graphical windows In this case the client' is the application
  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources such as windows or a
  mouse and the server' is the machine that provides them  In many
  situations the client is an application program running on the same
  machine as the server

  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation
  of the client and server so that windows may be broadcast' to a
  server at a remote location from the  client Unfortunately this
  dynamic power also introduces many deep intricate and complicated
  security considerations  The primary security and privacy issue
  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be
  sent over a network and over wider regions than in the case where
  the human is situated near the host computer  Currently there is
  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X
  Windows

  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design
  flaws  early versions of the X Window system are extremely
  insecure Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt
  that display or read it electronically based on access to the
  device unix by any regular user   There are no protections
  from this type of access in these versions   The problem arises
  because the security is completely based on machine addresses
  rather than users such that any user at a trusted' machine is
  himself trusted Quoting from X documentation man Xsecurity
  
   Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed
   access to the X server This system can work reasonably well in
   an environment where everyone trusts everyone or when only a
   single person can log into a given machineThis system does not
   work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and
   mutual trust does not exist 
  
  With the access control list the xhost' command may prevent some
  naive attempts ie those other than the directaccess unix
  evasion the syntax as typed on the host machine is  xhost
  name'' where name is the domain name or internet address of an
  authorized client machine By default clients running nonlocal to
  the host are disabled  Public domain programs to disrupt a display
  momentarily such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image or
  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom have been circulating on
  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks
  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users  Much more serious security
  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this
  inherent weaknesses  The minimal easilybypassed trusted'
  security mode of xhost' has been jokingly referred to as X
  Hanging Open Security Terrible'' 

  New versions of the X Window system XR and higher by default 
  make server access as secure as the file system using a Xauthority
  file and 'magic cookies'  Remote machines must have a code in the
  Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code
  allowed by the server  Many older programs and even new
  vendorsupplied code does not support or is incompatible with
  magic cookies' The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to
  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of
  keys occurs in transmission  XR also includes other
  sophisticated encryption mechanisms  Try man Xsecurity' to find
  out what is supported at your site  Even though improved security 
  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since  local
  sites often update this software infrequently because installation
  is extremely complex

 How insecure is my email

  By default not very  The characters that you are reading are
  almost certainly encoded in ASCII the American Standard Code for
  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic
  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa  Virtually every
  computer system uses this code and if not has ways of converting
  to and from it  When you write a mail message by default it is
  being sent in ASCII  and since the standard is virtually
  universal there is no intrinsic privacy  Despite milleniums worth
  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge cryptographic technologies
  are only recently being established that afford high priority to
  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design  Some
  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows

   The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous
    system operators reading private mail in the spool files' at a
    local site ie at the source or destination of the message
    such as a university 
  
   System administrators may also release files to law enforcement
    agencies but conventions and protocols for warrants involving
    computer searches have still not been strongly established and
    tested legally

   Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in
    their entirety  This means that if you address mail with an
    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human
    other than the recipient

   Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local
    mail directory is private but this is not guaranteed and can be
    overridden

   Finally be aware that some mailing lists email addresses of 
    everyone on a list are actually publicly accessable via mail 
    routing software mechanisms  This feature' can be disabled

  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly
  avoided with the use of strong endtoend cryptography which has
  its own set of caveats for example unscrupulous administrators
  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or
  nonlocal  See the sections on email privacy'' and email
  policies''


 How am I not liable for my email and postings

  As punishment or whatever your system administrator can revoke
  certain privileges' such as emailing USENET posting or reading
  certain groups file transferring remote communications or
  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account 
  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator
  and under the procedures followed at a particular site which in
  many cases are haphazard and crisisoriented  Currently there are
  virtually no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures  for
  restricting use to any internet services and local administrators
  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access

  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations
  In the typical scenario complaints reach a system adminstrator
  regarding abuses by a user usually but not necessarily preceded by
  complaints to the user in email regarding that person's
  objectionable email or postings  abusive' posters to USENET are
  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as
  urged by others on the net' The debate persists endlessly on
  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means
  of attacking or silencing harmless crackpots' or censoring
  unpopular opinions
  
  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to
  'squelch' severe cases of abuse  In general however by tradition
  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of
  the system but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe
  their alternatives when this patience is sapped the options
  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next
  message referred to as hitting the n' key'' or to plonk'
  annoying posters according to the Hacker's Dictionary the sound a
  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file

  In cases where punitive actions are applied generally system
  administrators are least likely to restrict email  USENET postings
  are much more commonly restricted either to individual users or 
  entire groups such as a university campus  Restrictions are most
  commonly associated with the following abuses'

   harassing or threatening notes email terrorism'
   illegal uses eg piracy or propagation of copyrighted material
   ad hominem' attacks ie insulting the reputation of the
    poster instead of citing the content of the message
   intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness
   inappropriate postings esp binary files in regular groups
    mailbombing' inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive
    files

  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and
  official email or postings  Most users have internet access via
  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the
  internet can be construed as representative of their parent
  organizations Many people put disclaimers in their signatures' in
  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent
  organizations as a precaution A recent visible political case
  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House
  staff members of the Bush administration  Following are some
  guidelines

   Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy
   If possible avoid use of your company email address for private
    communication
   Use a disclaimer
   Keep a low profile avoid flamewars' or simply don't post
   Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be
    proprietary or internal'

 How do I provide moreless information to others on my identity

  The public information of your identity and account is mostly
  available though the UNIX utility finger' described above 
  
   You have control over most of this information with the utility
    chfn' the specifics vary between sites on some systems use
    passwd f'
   
   You can provide unlimited information in the plan file which is
    copied directly to the destination during the fingering 
    
   A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is
    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the plan file sent to them
    
   Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE
    
   USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the signature file
    in your home directory
    
  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult
  and involved  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to
  change or delete information about you such as your full name 
  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from
  someone unrelated to you personally  You may be able to remotely
  login via modem or otherwise to computers that you are not
  physically near  These are tactics for hiding or masking your
  online activities but nothing is foolproof  Consult man pages on
  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode  Generally files on
  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very
  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators

  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different
  accounts More untraceable are new anonymous posting' and
  remailing services that are very recently being established  See
  below


 Who is my sysadmin  What does she know about me

  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration
  job and thereby access to all information on a system vary widely
  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax especially at
  universities  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely
  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often
  hacking'  In general commercial and industrial sites are more
  strict on qualifications and background and government sites are
  extremely strict

  The system adminstrator root user can monitor what commands you
  used and at what times  She may have a record backups of files
  on your account over a few weeks She can monitor when  you send
  email or post USENET messages and potentially read either  She
  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using
  both locally and elsewhere  Administrators sometimes employ
  specialized programs to  track strange' or unusual' activity
  which can potentially be misused


 Why is privacy unstable on the internet

  For the numerous reasons listed above privacy should not be an
  expectation with current use of the internet  Furthermore large
  parts of the internet are funded by the US NSF National Science
  Foundation which places certain restrictions on its use such as
  prohibiting commercial use  Some highlevel officials in this and
  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to
  guarantee privacy such as encryption and anonymous services

  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been
  local Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread
  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some
  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as pornographic' The
  alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system which has virtually
  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation is
  frequently targeted although this material may appear anywhere

  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely
  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders
  are pursued  For example  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted
  material such as newspaper or magazine articles are posted to
  USENET with regularity without major consequences some email
  complaints may ensue  More astonishing to some is that currently
  significant portions of USENET traffic and less so internet
  traffic is comprised of sexuallyexplicit digitized images almost
  entirely originating from copyrighted material newsgroups such as
  altsex' regularly have the  highest traffic
  

 What is the future of privacy on the internet

  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or
  appropriate level of privacy  Others will argue that as a
  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate
  safeguards  The internet is growing to become a completely global
  international superhighway for data and this traffic will
  inevitably entail data such as voice messages postal mail and
  many other items of extremely personal nature Computer items that
  many people consider completely private such as their local hard
  drives will literally be inches from global network connections
  Also sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged
  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with
  the internet
  
  Most would agree that for these basic but sensitive uses of the
  internet no significant mechanisms are currently in place to
  ensure much privacy New standards are calling for uniform
  introduction of privacy enhanced mail' PEM which uses encryption
  technologies to ensure privacy so that privacy protection is
  automatic and may significantly improve safeguards

  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy
  such as with  surreptitious surveilance can be overwhelmingly
  effective in protecting  it eg with encryption Some government
  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general and believe
  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct
  eg courtauthorized wiretapping  However powerful new
  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming
  increasingly popular provoking some to say that the cat is out
  of the bag'' and the genie can't be put back in the bottle''  In
  less idiomatic terms they believe that the spread of strong
  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically
  unstoppable
  
  To date no feasible system that guarantees both secure
  communication and government oversight has been proposed the two
  goals are largely incompatible Proposals for registration'' of
  secret keys by D Denning on scicrypt for example have been met
  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst
  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections
  of inherent feasibility  Electronic privacy issues and
  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet will
  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few
  years


ANONYMITY



 What is anonymity' on the internet

  Simply stated anonymity is the absence of identity the
  ultimate in privacy However there are several variations on
  this simple theme  A person may wish to be consistently
  identified by a certain pseudonym or handle' and establish a
  reputation under it in some area providing pseudoanonymity
  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single
  oneway message a sort of hitandrun' Or a person may
  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with
  others with either known or anonymous identities via an
  anonymous return address'  A user may wish to appear as a
  regular user' but actually be untraceable  Sometimes a user
  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to in addition to the
  message itself The anonymous item itself may be directed at
  individuals or groups  A user may wish to access some
  service and hide all  signs of the association 
  
  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently
  tricky to carry out in practice because of all the tracking
  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols 
  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed
  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse 
  Nevertheless the inherent facelessness of large networks will
  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity


 Why is anonymity' unimportant on the internet

  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or
  problematic depending on its use  Arguably absence of
  identification is important as the presence of it  It may be the
  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be
  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted because true
  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish

  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague
  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly such as
  employeremployee scenarios  One can use it to pass information
  and evade any threat of direct retribution  For example
  whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses economic social
  or  political can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or
  retaliation Sensitive personal potentially damaging information
  is often posted to some USENET groups a risky situation where
  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely
  independent of the identities of the participants  Some police
  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of
  crimes such uses would be straightforward on the network
  Unfortunately extortion and harassment become more insidious with
  assurances of anonymity


 How can anonymity be protected on the internet

  The chief means as alluded to above are masking identities in
  email and posting However anonymous accounts public accounts as
  accessable and anonymous as eg public telephones may be
  effective as well but this use is generally not officially
  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF
  guidelines  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining
  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous
  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large

  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to
  anonymity  Virtually every protocol in existence currently
  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet
  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee
  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication


 What is anonymous mail'

  One approach to anonymizing' mail has been to set up an anonymous
  server' that when activated by email to its address responds by
  allocating and supplying an anonymous ID' that is unique to the
  person requesting it based on his email address  This will vary
  for the same person for different machine address email
  originations To send anonymous mail the user sends email directed
  to the server containing the final destination The server
  anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information
  and forwards the message which appears to originate from the
  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id 
  This is the interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity
  mentioned above

  Another more fringe' approach is to run a cypherpunk' remailer
  from a regular user account no root system privileges are
  required These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and
  Hal Finney halalumnicaltechedu The operator runs a process on
  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain
  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail
  typically fields in the header One has been implemented as a 
  PERL script running on UNIX  Several of these are in existence
  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable
  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge
  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses 
  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator 
  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any
  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system
  although actually may be held liable regardless

  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses
  
   The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of
    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained
    indefinitely  One alternative is to allow deallocation' of
    aliases at the request of the user but this has not been
    implemented yet

   Although an unlikely scenario traffic to any of these sites could
    conceivably be monitored from the outside' necessitating the
    use of cryptography for basic protection

   Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or
    under pressure from local network or government agencies
  
   Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic
    that goes through them

   Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected 

   The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these
    operators are basically  network users who do not own the
    equipment and are accountable  to their own system
    administrators who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic
    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered
    regarding it as illicit use 

   In all cases a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous
    server operator by the user

  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP
  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary
  field information  This practice not uncommon to hackers and the
  approach used by remailers is generally viewed with hostility by
  most system administrators  Information in the header routing data
  and logs of network port connection information may be retained
  that can be used to track the originating site  In practice this
  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out  Some
  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to
  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished
  more severely such as revoking the account all of this actually
  happening occasionally but infrequently

  See the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
  responsibilities associated with anonymity''


 What is anonymous posting'

  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet
  posting with all the associated caveats above monitored traffic
  capricious or risky local circumstances logging  Make sure to
  test the system at least once by eg anonymous posting to
  misctest however some operators don't recommend this because many
  sites autorespond' to test messages possibly causing the
  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines 
  See the responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''
  before proceeding

  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a
  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information
  This practice not uncommon to hackers is also generally viewed
  with hostility by most system administrators and similar
  consequences can ensue

  See the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
  responsibilities associated with anonymity''


 Why is anonymity unstable on the internet

  As noted many factors compromise the anonymity currently available
  to the general internet community and these services should be
  used with great caution  To summarize the technology is in its
  infancy and current approaches are unrefined unreliable and not
  completely trustworthy  No standards have been established and
  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software
  are prevalent  Here are some encountered and potential bugs 
  
   One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous
    return addresses 
   Others passed signature information embedded in messages
    unaltered 
   Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced
    to a remailer are common
   Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem  possibly
    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID  email
    address  mappings in the alias file  This can be remedied with
    the use of passwords
   Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers
  
  Source code is being distributed tested and refined for these
  systems but standards are progressing slowly and weakly  The
  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official
  endorsement and action by network agencies  The whole idea is
  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and
  distrust by many on the internet seen as illegitimate or favorable
  to criminality  The major objection to anonymity over regular
  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system
  operators ie invulnerability to account restrictions resulting
  from outside complaints  System adminstrators at some sites have
  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the
  prominent servers from their redistribution flows  This may only
  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less
  characteristically detectable headers  Probably the least
  problematic approach and the most traditional to Usenet is for
  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer
  eg ignoring it or filtering it with kill files
  

 What is the future of anonymity on the internet

  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase
  safeguards of anonymity  For example the same mechanism that
  routes email over multiple hosts thereby threatening its privacy
  can also be used to guarantee it In a scheme called chaining' an
  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers
  before reaching a destination  In this way generally multiple
  links of the chain have to be broken' for security to be
  compromised Reencryption at each link makes this scenario even
  more unlikely  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers
  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses
  such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation
  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message
  tracing However remailers run by corrupt operators are possible
  
  The future of anonymous services on the internet is at this time
  highly uncertain and fraught with peril While specific groups seem
  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities many
  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a
  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in
  serious' groups   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity
  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and
  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and alt' groups have had
  in the past For example as part of new group creation the
  charter may specify whether anonymous' posting is unwelcome 

  Nevertheless the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may
  be inevitable Based on traffic statistics anonymous services are
  in huge demand Pervasive and readily available anonymity could
  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences  However if
  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may
  be confined to the underground  The ramifications of widespread
  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown It
  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new
  traffic or instead of expansion cause a shift where a greater
  portion of existing traffic is anonymized  Conceivably the
  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social
  acceptance of Usenet

  From the RIPEM FAQ by Marc VanHeyningen
  mvanheynwhalecsindianaedu on newsanswers

   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail PEM
   using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES  It allows
   your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication
   ie who sent it can be confirmed and privacy ie nobody can
   read it except the intended recipient
   
   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan
   mrrscssclmsuedu Most of the code is in the public domain
   except for the RSA routines which are a library called RSAREF
   licensed from RSA Data Security Inc
   
   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
   residents in the US from rsacom cd to rsaref and read the
   README file for info
   
   RIPEM as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site' on
   rpubclmsuedu which is open to nonanonymous FTP for users in
   the US and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents  To
   find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pubcrypt and
   read the file GETTINGACCESS

  Note cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet
  and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it


 What is the cypherpunks mailing list

  Eric Hughes hughestoadcom runs the cypherpunk' mailing list
  dedicated to discussion about technological defenses for privacy
  in the digital domain''  Send email to
  cypherpunksrequesttoadcom to be added or subtracted from the
  list From the charter

   The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption
   To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy  But to encrypt
   with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
   privacy Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will
   learn how best to defend it

 How can I run an anonymous remailer

  Cypherpunk remailer source is at sodaberkeleyedu in the
  pubcypherpunks directory  It's written in PERL and is
  relatively easy to install no administrative rights are required
  Karl Barrus  eleesfmenudouhedu has more information and
  modifications Also most remailer operators mentioned above are
  amenable to discussing features problems and helping new sites
  become operational Address all points in the section
  responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to
  advertising your service  You should be committed to the longterm
  stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously

 What is digital cash''

  With digital encryption and authentication technologies the
  possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be
  realized  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks
  similar to today's checking system except entirely digital may
  be one approach  The issues of cryptography privacy and
  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an
  economy  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum

 What is a hacker'' or cracker''

  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning
  especially on the internet  In the general news media in the past
  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends such as
  breaking into systems has been referred to as a hacker but most
  internet users prefer the term cracker'' for this  Instead a
  hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious
  curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a
  system for examplesomething of a proud electronic pioneer and
  patriot  This is the sense intended in this document  See also

 What is a cypherpunk''

  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list

   Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were
   more of it  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy
   must create it for themselves and not expect governments
   corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant
   them privacy out of beneficence  Cypherpunks know that people
   have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers
   envelopes closed doors and couriers  Cypherpunks do not seek
   to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or
   their opinions

 What is steganography' and anonymous pools

  Closely associated with encryption is steganography' or the
  techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication
  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself 
  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the
  proliferation of computer technology  For example it is possible
  to encode messages in the leastsignificant bits of images
  typically the most 'noisy' In addition when such an item is
  posted in a public place such as a newsgroup virtually
  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and
  receiver  For  steganographic communications in the electronic
  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where
  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual
  users decode particular messages with their unique key   An
  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman

 What is security through obscurity'

  Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain
  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information
  or programs relating to them  For example a company may not make
  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade
  attacks' based on knowledge of it Another example would be
  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in
  operating systems  Or some reliance may be made on the fact that
  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious
  because they are not widely known'' or not widely used'' This
  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet
  posting forgery' Security through obscurity' is regarded as a
  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at
  worst also called the headinthesand approach'' See the FAQ
  for altsecurity  
  
  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow cofounder of the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation directed to NSA agents at the First
  International Symposium on National Security  National
  Competitiveness held in McLean Virginia  Dec  

   Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep
   contained  This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile  It's
   almost a life form in its ability to selfpropagate  If
   something hits the Net and it's something which people on there
   find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind  I
   believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into
   an environment where any information which is at all interesting
   to people is going to get out  And there will be very little
   that you can do about it  This is not a bad thing in my view
   but you may differ


 What are identity daemons'
  
  RFC describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to
  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local
  communication socket a connection of this type is established
  during FTP and TELNET sessions for example  The standard is not
  widely supported perhaps  of internet sites currently implement
  it but the number is increasing  The mechanism is detrimental to
  anonymity  Regular users cannot disable it but system
  adminstrators can circumvent it  This standard may represent a
  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms


 What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy


  RemailingPosting
  
  
   Stable secure protected officially sanctioned and permitted
    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs
   Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET
    postings
   Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information
    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms chaining
    encrypted addresses etc
   Standards for anonymous email addressing embedding files and
    remailer site chaining
  
  General
  
  
   Recognition of anonymity cryptography and related privacy
    shields as legitimate useful desirable and crucial by the
    general public and their governments
   Widespread use and implementation of these technologies 
    by systems designers into
    hardware software and standards implemented securely'
    seamlessly' and transparently'
   General shift of use dependence and reliance to means other than
    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement
    agencies
   Publicity retraction and dissolution of laws and government
    agencies opposed to privacy replaced by structures dedicated to
    strengthening and protecting it

 What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF

  From ftpefforgpubEFFmissionstatement

   A new world is arising in the vast web of digital electronic
   media which connect us  Computerbased communication media like
   electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis
   of new forms of community  These communities without a single
   fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an
   electronic frontier
   
   While wellestablished legal principles and cultural norms give
   structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like
   newspapers books and telephones the new digital media do not
   so easily fit into existing frameworks  Conflicts come about as
   the law struggles to define its application in a context where
   fundamental notions of speech property and place take
   profoundly new forms People sense both the promise and the
   threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies
   even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the
   workplace and the home
   
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help
   civilize the electronic frontier to make it truly useful and
   beneficial not just to a technical elite but to everyone and to
   do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest
   traditions of the free and open flow of information and
   communication
  
  EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor founder of
  Lotus software and John Barlow lyricist for the Grateful Dead
  rock band  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization
  involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI
  raid and an accompanying civil suit  see section on Steve

  by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' complete text in 
  ftpeffcompubpubinfra

   we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to
   work with other sectors of the communications industry to create
   a consumeroriented public information network Please let me or
   my staff know what policies you and others in the computer
   industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating
   a reasonably priced widely available network in which
   competition is open and innovation rewarded  I also want to
   learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten
   to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on
   structuring the information and communications networks of the
   futureI ask your help in gaining input from the computer
   industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will
   bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the
   information services industry

 What was Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case

  In the early 's a fear spread among US law enforcement agencies
  on the illicit activities of hackers' and phreakers' involved in
  such activities as credit card fraud and longdistance call thievery
  
  see ftpefforgpubSJGGeneralInformationEFFector

   Operation Sundevil' the Phoenixinspired crackdown of May
    concentrated on telephone codefraud and creditcard
   abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success 
   Bulletin Board Systems went down all over America terrifying
   the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of
   their criminal instruments  It also saddled analysts with some
    floppy disks and confronted harried Justice Department
   prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide
   hacker showtrial involving highly technical issues in dozens of
   jurisdictions

  Massive showtrials' never materialized although isolated
  instances of prosecution were pursued  The movement reached a
  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal
  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of
  Austin Texas on March    From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST
  by Bruce Sterling bruceswellsfcaus in Fantasy and Science
  Fiction Magazine

   In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional
   warrant agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the
   SJG office  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared
   for publication private electronic mail and several computers
   including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin
   Board System  Yet Jackson and his business were not only
   innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place 
   The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that
   somewhere in Jackson's office there might be' a document
   compromising the security of the  telephone system

  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed
  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier
  Foundation  See information on EFF below  From an article by Joe
  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle Feb  
  
   AUSTIN  An electronic civil rights case against the Secret
   Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal
   District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a
   proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown
   and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment 
   
   Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago who was in
   charge of three Austin computer searchandseizures on March 
    that led to the lawsuit stoically endured Spark's rebuke
   over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer
   seizure policies  While the Service has seized dozens of
   computers since the crackdown began in  this is the first
   case to challenge the practice 
   
   Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin
   science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never
   suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal
   research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and
   the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine
   that the company was a publisher Indeed agents testified that
   they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the
   special Secret Service school on computer crime 
   
   How long would it have taken you Mr Foley to find out what
   Steve Jackson Games did what it was asked Sparks An hour 
   
   Was there any reason why on March  you could not return to
   Steve Jackson Games a copy in floppy disk form of everything
   taken 
   
   Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had
   a picture of Steve Jackson  a lawabiding taxpaying citizen
    saying he was a computer crime suspect 
   
   Did it ever occur to you Mr Foley that seizing this material
   could harm Steve Jackson economically 
   
   Foley replied No sir but the judge offered his own answer 
   
   You actually did you just had no idea anybody would actually go
   out and hire a lawyer and sue you 
   
   More than  has been spent by the Electronic Frontier 
   Foundation in bringing the case to trial The EFF was founded by 
   Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large
   part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown

 What is Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN

  ISDN is a highspeed data communications standard that utilizes
  existing copper telephone lines and is a possible inexpensive and
  intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone
  networks  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and
  video transmission applications  G V der Leun in the file
  ftpefforg pubpubinfra

   Telecommunications in the United States is at a crossroads  With
   the Regional Bell Operating Companies now free to provide
   content the shape of the information networking is about to be
   irrevocably altered  But will that network be the open
   accessible affordable network that the American public needs 
   You can help decide this question
   
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation recently presented a plan to
   Congress calling for the immediate deployment of a national
   network based on existing ISDN technology accessible to anyone
   with a telephone connection and priced like local voice service
    We believe deployment of such a platform will spur the
   development of innovative new information services and maximize
   freedom competitiveness and civil liberties throughout the
   nation
   
   The EFF is testifying before Congress and the FCC making
   presentations to public utility commisions from Massachusetts to
   California and meeting with representatives from telephone
   companies publishers consumer advocates and other stakeholders

 What is the FBI's proposed Digital Telephony Act

  Providers of electronic communication services and private branch
  exchange operators shall provide within the United States
  capability and capacity for the government to intercept wire and
  electronic communications when authorized by law''
  
  From BBS Legislative Watch FBIs Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted' by
  S Steele in Boardwatch Magazine Feb  p 
 
   In a move that worried privacy experts software manufacturers and
   telephone companies the FBI proposed legislation to amend the
   Communications Act of  to make it easier for the Bureau to
   perform electronic wiretapping The proposed legislation
   entitled 'Digital Telephony' would have required communications
   service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their
   systems 'tappable' by providing 'back doors' through which law
   enforcement officers could intercept communications Furthermore
   this capability would have been provided undetectably while the
   communications was in progress exclusive of any communications
   between other parties regardless of the mobility of the target
   of the FBI's investigation and without degradation of service
    
   under the proposal the Department of Justice DOJ can keep
   communications products off the market if it determines that
   these products do not meet the DOJ's own  guidelines This
   could result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for
   service providers and equipment manufacturers since they will be
   unlikely to add any features that may result in a DOJ rejection
   of their entire product the FBI proposal suggests that the
   cost of this wiretapping 'service' to the Bureau would have to be
   borne by the service provider itself
   
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of
   public interest and industry groups from Computer Professionals
   for Social Responsibilty CPSR and the ACLU to ATT and Sun
   Microsystems to oppose the legislation A white paper produced
   by the EFF and ratified by the coalition entitled An Analysis
   of the FBI Digital Telephony Proposal' was widely distributed
   throughout the Congress   The Justice Department lobbied hard
   in the final days to get Congress to take up the bill before
   Congress adjourned but the bill never  found a Congressional
   sponsor and was therefore never officially introduced The FBI
   may reintroduce Digital Telephony when the rd Congress
   convenes in January

 What is the background behind the Internet
 
  The article Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce
  Sterling bruceswellsfcaus contains general and nontechnical
  introductory notes on origins of the Internet including the role
  of the RAND corporation the goal of network resilience in face of
  nuclear attack MIT UCLA ARPANET TCPIP NSF NREN etc

   ARPANET itself formally expired in  a happy victim of its 
   own overwhelming success  Its users scarcely noticed for
   ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved 
   The use of  TCPIP standards for computer networking is now
   global  In  a  mere twentyone years ago there were only
   four nodes in the  ARPANET  network  Today there are tens of
   thousands of  nodes in  the Internet  scattered over fortytwo
   countries with more coming  online every day   Three million
   possibly four million people use  this gigantic
   motherofallcomputernetworks   
   
   The Internet is especially popular among scientists and is 
   probably the most important scientific instrument of the late 
   twentieth century   The  powerful sophisticated access that it 
   provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped
   up the pace of scientific research enormously  
   
   The Internet's pace of growth in the early s is  spectacular 
   almost ferocious  It is spreading faster than cellular phones
   faster  than fax machines  Last year the Internet was growing at
   a rate of  twenty percent a month  The number of host'
   machines with direct  connection to TCPIP has been doubling
   every year since     The Internet is moving out of  its
   original base in military and  research institutions  into
   elementary and high schools as well as into  public libraries
   and the commercial sector

 How Internet anarchy' like the English language

  According to Bruce Sterling bruceswellsfcaus

   The Internet's anarchy' may seem strange or even unnatural  but
   it makes a certain deep and basic sense  It's rather like the 
   anarchy' of the English language  Nobody rents English and
   nobody  owns English    As an Englishspeaking person it's up
   to you to learn  how to speak English properly  and make whatever
   use you please  of it though the government provides certain
   subsidies to help you  learn to read and write a bit  
   Otherwise everybody just sort of  pitches in and somehow the
   thing evolves on its own and somehow  turns out workable  And
   interesting   Fascinating even   Though a lot  of people earn
   their living from using and exploiting  and teaching  English
   English' as an institution is public property a public good  
   Much the same goes for the Internet   Would English  be improved
   if  the The English Language Inc'  had a board of directors
   and a chief  executive officer or a President and a Congress  
   There'd probably be  a lot fewer new words in English and a lot
   fewer new ideas

 What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites

  Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites
  is anonpenetfi operated by julfpenetfi for several months who
  has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment 
  Including anonymized mail Usenet posting and return addresses 
  no encryption  Send mail to helppenetfi for information
 
  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk
  remailers on the ftp site sodaberkeleyedu 
  pubcypherpunkshal'sinstructions See also scriptstarZ UNIX
  scripts to aid remailer use and anonmailarj MSDOS batch files to

  phantommeaduwashingtonedu 
  
    Experimental remailer with encryption to server  finger' site
    address for information

  Notes
  
  
   Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
    running without site administrator knowledge Liability issues
    are wholly unresolved
  
   So far all encryption is based on publickey cryptography and PGP
    software see the question on cryptography 

   Encryption aspects message text destination address replies
    vary between sites

   Multiple chaining alias unlinking and address encryption are
    mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time


 What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity

  
  Users
  

   Use anonymity only if you have to Frivolous uses weaken the
    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others
   Do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others
   Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
    Usenet  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups
   If posting large files be attentive to bandwidth considerations
    Remember simply sending the posting to the service increases
    network traffic
   Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet this
    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers The alt'
    hierarchy is preferred
   Give as much information as possible in the posting ie
    references etc Remember that content is the only means for
    readers to judge the truth of the message and that any
    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
    future ones under the same handle
   Be careful not to include information that will reveal your
    identity or enable someone to deduce it  Test the system by
    sending anonymized mail to yourself
   Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them 
    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege
   Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity
   Hitandrun'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation
    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead
   Be courteous to the system operator who may have invested large
    amounts of time be personally risking his account or dedicating
    his hardware all for your convenience

  Operators
  

   Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
    introductory file that is sent to new users  Have a coherent and
    consistent policy and stick to it State clearly what logging and
    monitoring is occurring Describe your background interest and
    security measures Will the general approach be totalitarian or
    lassaizfaire
   Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas What if a user
    is blackmailing someone through your service What if a user
    posts suicidal messages through your service Remember your
    users trust you to protect them
   In the site introductory note give clear examples  of situations
    where you will take action and what these actions will be eg
    warn the user limit anonymity to email or posting only revoke
    the account 'out' the user contact local administrator etc
   Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware
    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site Report candidly
    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred  Work closely with
    users to isolate and fix bugs Address all bugs noted below under
    instability of anonymity''
   Document the stability of the sitehow long has it been running
    What compromises have occured Why are you running it What is
    your commitment to it
   Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages  Include an
    address for complaints ideally appended to every outgoing item 
    Consult a lawyer about your liability
   Be committed to the longterm stability of the site Be prepared
    to deal with complaints and hate mail' addressed to you  If you
    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system
    adminstrator consult those who do and are
   Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups  If
    possible query group readers
   Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message
    format that can be screened effectively by kill files  Ensure
    the key text Anon' is  somewhere in every header
   Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from
    physical and  networkbased attacks and infiltrations

  Readers
  
  
   Do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason
    that he is posting anonymously make blanket condemnations that
    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail
    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons eg its
    volume is heavy or increasing
   React to the anonymous information unemotionally  Abusive posters
    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate
    responses  Sometimes the most effective response is silence
   Notify operators if very severe abuses occur such as piracy
    harassment extortion etc
   Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they
    offend you personally
   Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the
    idea of anonymity itself
   Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings
    should be barred from particular groups because no possible' or
    conceivable' need exists

   This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual
   privacy and the use of handles  It accepts the need of a system
   operator to know the name of a user but suggests that the use of
   a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a
   letter to the editor The article concludes with a set of
   guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous


 How do I kill' anonymous postings

  James Thomas Green jgreenzeuscalpolyedu

   Try putting this in your kill file
     
     Anonhj
     Anonymoushj
   
   This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that
   contain Anon' or Anonymous' in them  Not perfect and won't
   kill followups 
  
  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask
  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work so
  far this practice is not widespread but it may become more common
  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering
  

 What is the history behind anonymous posting servers

  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for
  individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity is
  almost the preferred method of communication such as talkabortion
  and altsexbondage  One of the first was one by Dave Mack
  started in  for altsexbondage Another early one was
  wizvaxmethuenmaus run by Stephanie Gilgut Gilgut Enterprises
  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds  The system provided
  anonymous return addresses nkbtraincom John Opalko took up
  the functions of this server including reinstating the anonymous
  alias file The group altpersonals has been chewing through
  servers like there's no tomorrow''
  
  Spurred by the disappearance of wizvax' and interested in
  researching the idea Karl Kleinpaste
  KarlKleinpastegodivanectarcscmuedu developed his own system
  from scratch in six hours By this time the idea of extending the
  server to new more mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge
  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by
  multiple users for anonymity in other groups The intended
  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group
  support with a single anon identifier across all  This was
  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems'' 
  K Kleinpaste posted a message on recnude asking users whether an
  anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus
  against it 

  K Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a fire extinguisher'' to
  squelch' or plonk' abusive users in response to complaints and
  used this in three cases Nevertheless after a few months of
  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his
  server Even as restricted as it was my system was subjected to
  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the
  facilities staff here Such abuses started right after it was
  created''

  In Nov  Johan Helsingius julfpenetFI set up the most
  controversial anonymous site to date anonpenetfi is based on
  scripts and C code written by K Kleinpaste and supports anonymized
  mail posting and return addresses He initially wanted to confine
  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide
  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests
  
  J Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet
  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological
  opposition eg by news adminstrators in newsadminpolicy
  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium
  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than
  routine'' abuses His total commitment to preservation of
  anonymity is also controversial

  For example in a highly controversial and publicized case in Feb
    an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate
  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via
  anonpenetfi to sciastro Despite that the transcript had been
  posted in the same place up to a year earlier then
  nonanonymously and actually originated not with the poster but a
  New York news tabloid subsequent responses consisted largely of
  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity reverberating
  through many newsgroups 
  
  The original poster using the same anonymous handle later conceded
  that the story seemed likely to have been fabricated''
  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was
  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of
  the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceived
  association with the item  The ensuing commotion generated queries
  for the original article by lateentering readers The anonymous
  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his
  detractors

  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints and even the vocal
  opposition and verbal abuse of K Kleinpaste and eminent news
  operators J Helsingius has largely avoided use of the fire
  extingisher'' and the group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the
  scope of the service As of March  the anonpenetfi site is
  best described as inundated' it has registered over  users
  in its initial three months of operation forwards  messages a
  day and approximately  of all Usenet postings are anonymized
  through the site The immense popularity is probably largely due
  to the capability for global' anonymity which has allowed users to
  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned

  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to
  dismantle his server in Feb  At one point K Kleinpaste
  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate
  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages
  originating from the site  J Helsingius has also alluded to
  threats of flooding the  server  The server has crashed several
  times at least once due to a saturation mailbombing' through it
  by an anonymous user  Mr Helsingius reports spending up to 
  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the
  service's administration In response to the serious threats he
  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and
  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly
  
  Based on fastmoving dialogue and creative suggestions by
  cypherpunks'' J Helsingius has identified many security
  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service and is
  currently in the process of code development and testing He is
  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible  machine to a  soon
  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new
  system with very sophisticated functionality including multiple
  email aliases alias allocation control publickey encryption
  etc

  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec
   by D Clunie dcluniepaxtpacomau that used cryptography
  in both directions tofrom the server for the highest degree of
  confidentiality seen so far  However it was running on a public
  access account and he had to shut it down after only several
  weeks upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately
  originating from NSF representatives D Clunie has released the
  software to the public domain

  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to whistleblowing' on
  government abuses has received wide and focused attention and
  group formation is currently underway  In the basic scenario the
  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers
  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable
  digital signatures The traffic may eventually reach reporters in
  the mainstream news media  deltortoaolcom has volunteered to
  attack multiple aspects of this project including distributing
  easytoread documentation on posting anonymization and
  encryption

 What is the value of anonymity

  KONDAREDPURCCVMBITNET
    
   I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the
   content of one's message Sure lot of anonymous posts are abusive
   or frivolous but in most cases these are by users who find the
   anon facility novel Once the novelty wears off they are stopping
   their pranks

  morganengrukyedu Wes Morgan

   I don't mind seeing the miscellaneous hatredprejudiceracism
   those things are part of our nature  However  the notion of
   providing anonymity's shield for these ideas repulses me  If
   they have such strong feelings why can't they put their names
   on  their postings  Quite frankly I loathe communication
   with people who refuse to use their names

  dcluniepaxtpacomau David Clunie
   
   Many seem to question the value of anonymity But who are they to
   say what risks another individual should take  There is no
   question that in this rather conservative society that we live
   in holding certain views making certain statements adopting a
   certain lifestyle are likely to result in public censure
   ridicule loss of status employment or even legal action Given
   the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdictions from where the many
   contributors to usenet post who knows what is legal and what is
   not  Some say that anonymous posters are cowards and should
   stand up and be counted Perhaps that is one point of view but
   what right do these detractors have to exercise such censorship 

  From dougccysuedu Doug Sewell
  
   Why is it censorship to not expect someone to speak for
   themselves without the cloak of anonymity This is at best a
   lame argument 
   
   You tell me why what you have to say requires anonymity  And you
   tell me why the wishes of a majority of nonanonymous users of a
   newsgroup should be disregarded when they don't want anonymous
   posts
   
   Anonymous users have LESS rights than any others They are not
   legitimate usenet participants I would not honor RFDs CFVs
   control messages or votes from one

  bradclarinetcom Brad Templeton
  
   I can think of no disadvantage caused by anon posting sites that
   doesn't already exist other than the fact that they do make more
   naive net users who don't know how to post anonymously the old
   way more prone to do it

  From mandelnetcomcom Tom Mandel
  
   I cannot speak for others but I regard anonymous postings in a
   serious discussion as pretty much worthless  views that hide 
   behind the veil of anon are hardly worth the trouble of reading
  
  nanonpenetfi Hank Pankey
  
   Since I began posting anonymously to show support for general
   principles of personal privacy I have been subject to far more
   abuse and attack than I ever received before People seem to
   find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they don't
   know Perhaps it's easier to pretend that there is no person
   behind the email address who feels the sting of abusive comments
   
   Anonymity does hinder some methods of controlling other posters'
   actions  People who seek such control will naturally oppose it

  From acearlleobsuvcbsuedu
  
   Instead of making this a freeer medium by allowing posters to
   protect themselves with anonymity simply require that all
   posters be prepared to discuss their sources of information and
   take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble  This seems to be the
   way things are currently done

   In misckids there are three threads going on started by anonymous
   posters One was about changing jobs so as to work less hours
   job sharing and so on from a woman who didn't want anyone at her
   current place of work to know she was thinking of looking for
   work elsewhere The next was from a woman who is thinking of
   having a baby sometime soon and doesn't want coworkers friends
   family etc etc to know all about it but who wants advice The
   third is about sex after parenthood  actually this was started
   by people posting in the usual way but then it was pointed out
   that the anonymous posting service might let more people
   participate
   
   Misckids doesn't seem to be suffering any harm from the presence
   of anonymous posters in fact it seems to have been helped by it

  hoeyzogwargetlarmymil Dan Hoey
  
   While there has never been any real security against anonymous or
   forged postings on Usenet the process has until now been
   sufficiently inconvenient errorprone and undocumented to limit
   its use by persons who have not learned the culture of the net
  
   On the other hand a recent use of the anonymous posting service
   on scimath seemed seemed to be a student asking help on a
   homework problem It has now been attributed to a teacher
   asking for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teaching
   guide  He says his news posting is broken so he is using the
   anonymous service as a mailtonews gateway

   Some argue that the opinions of the people who hide behind a veil
   of anonymity are worthless and that people should own up to
   their thoughts  I agree with the latter point  in an ideal
   world we would all be sitting around engaging in Socratic
   dialogues freely exchanging our opinions in an effort to
   learn  But in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for your
   thoughts or ridicule you
   
   But we live in a world where the people who don't agree with you
   may try to harm you  Let's face it some people aren't going to
   agree with your opinion no matter how logically you try to
   present it or how reasoned out it may be  This is sad since it
   does restrict people from voicing their opinions

  redredpollneoucomedu Richard E Depew

   The consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service
   such as that at anonpenetfi seems sufficiently corrosive of the
   trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment
   should be ended  Perhaps the next time the question comes up we
   can say We tried it  we learned it does more harm than good 
   and we stopped it 

  From Cvmurzuniheidelbergde Alexander EICHENER

   anonymous posting has not created major problems aside from
   angering irate people like you who would rather ban
   anonymouspseudonymous posting altogether because real men can
   stand up for what they said or comparable puerile arguments as
   others have brought up

  daveelxrjplnasagov Dave Hayes

   What a primal example of human nature I have three questions for
   you folks 
   
   Do people really say different things to each other based upon
   whether their identity is or isn't known
   
   Are people really so affected by what other people say that the
   verbage is labeled abuse
   
   Most importantly on a forum that prizes itself on the freedom of
   communication that it enjoys is there really such a thing as
   freedom of communication
  
  From terrygeovisiongvccom Terry McGonigal
  
   sigh  Just how many anon services are needed  Will
   everybody start running one soon  What's the purpose  Who
   stands to benefit when there are N anon services then N then
   N out there  Where has this sudden fasination with anon
   services come from
   
   For better or IMHO worse it looks like we'er gonna get stuck
   with these things and as much as I don't like the idea of
   services like this becoming the norm I don't really think
   there's much to be done since it's obvious that anyone who wants
   to can set one up with a bit of work

  KarlKleinpastecscmuedu Karl Kleinpaste

 Should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed

  morganengrukyedu Wes Morgan
  
   I will be the first to admit that I hold some controversial
   opinions indeed I'm sure that none of us are completely
   orthodox in our opinions However  I've received hundreds of
   anonymous email messages over the last few years fewer than 
   of them were reasonable posts made with good motives It's 
   getting more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity
   at all the abusers are once again lousing things up for those
   who truly need the service  or those who would put it to good
   use
   
   I'm not suggesting that we should ban anonymous servers as I've
   said there are several situations in which anonymity is a Good
   Thing tm 
   
   However the notion that anonymity's shield should be
   automatically extended to every Usenet discussion is ridiculous
   it opens the door to further abuse 

  twpierceunixamherstedu Tim Pierce
  
   Of course how does one determine whether a group requests the
   service  A flat majority of posters voting in favor A positive
   margin of  votes  Or what  No one speaks for a newsgroup
   
   I'm not convinced by the arguments that an anonymous posting
   service for all newsgroups is inherently a bad idea simply
   because it's a diversion from the status quo Since the status
   quo previously permitted anonymous posting to no newsgroups
   any anonymous posting service would reject the status quo
  
  hartmanulogicUUCP Richard M Hartman writes
  
   It is facist to suggest that a newsgroup is best able to decide
   whether it wants to allow anonymous postings instead of having
   them forced upon them by an service administrator

  ogilquadsuchicagoedu Brian W Ogilvie

   The service provides a mechanism for forwarding mail to the
   original poster Since most Usenet readers don't know John Smith
   from Jane Doe except by their opinions and their address the
   effect of having an anonymous posting to which mail replies can
   be directed is minimal except for those who personally know the
   posterand  the lack of anonymity could be serious Any
   mechanism like this is liable to abuse but the benefits as well
   as the costs must be weighed Limiting the service to alt groups
   or specific groups would not help those who want advice on
   sensitive issues in more 'professional' newsgroups

  From tarlswstratuscom Tarl Neustaedter
  
   An additional point is that some of us find anonimity in technical
   matters to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forums
   has different meanings If I get a phone call from someone who
   won't identify himself I hang up If I get US mail with no
   return address it goes into the garbage unopened If someone
   accosts me in the street while wearing a mask I back away 
   carefully and expecting violence In a technical discussion
   anonimity means that the individual isn't willing to associate
   himself with the matter being discussed which discredits his
   utterances and makes listening to them a waste of time
     
   Anonimity leads to fun psych experiments the literature is filled
   with all the various things that people will do anonymously that
   they won't otherwise Including one notorious study involving
   torture that would not have passed today's ethical standards Fun
   stuff in any case
   
   FINE LEAVE US OUT OF IT

  From jbuckforneyberkeleyedu Joe Buck

   You obviously have never submitted an article to a refereed
   journal where you will receive anonymous reviews through a server
   the editor that behaves much like the one in Finland eg you 
   may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity    Your
   comparison of someone who wants to express himherself on a 
   technical issue anonymously with a person who approaches you on a 
   dark street with a ski mask is just emotionally overwrought 
   nonsense such posters pose no physical threat to you
 
  jikmitedu J Kamens
  
   It seems obvious to me that the default should be not to allow
   anonymous postings in a newsgroup  The Usenet has always
   operated on the principle that the status quo should be kept
   unless there's a large number of people who want to change it
   
   If someone REALLY needs to post a message anonymous in a newsgroup
   in which this usually isn't done they can usually find someone
   on the net to do this for them They don't need an automated
   service to do it and the automated service is by its nature
   incapable of making the judgment call necessary to decide whether
   a particular posting really needs to be anonymous

  From twpierceunixamherstedu Tim Pierce
  
   For any newsgroup you name I bet I can envision a scenario
   involving a need for secrecy If an accurate contentbased
   filter of each anonymous posting could be devised to screen out
   those that don't require secrecy wonderful  But it can't be
   done

  From lhpdaimiaaudk Lasse Hillere Petersen
  
   If a newsgroup wants to be noise and nuisancefree then it
   should call for moderation This should happen on a pernewsgroup
   basis and not as a general USENET ban on anonymous postings Of
   course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all
   anonymous postings and could be achieved automatically It would
   still be moderation Personally I would prefer moderation
   criteria being based on actual content

  David A Clunie dcluniepaxtpacomau
  
   If a group doesn't want to receive certain posts it should
   become moderated  there are clearly defined mechanisms on
   nonalt groups for this to take place An automated moderator
   excluding posts from certain eg anonymous sites or individuals
   could easily be established If anyone wants to take such a
   draconian approach then they are welcome to do so and good luck
   to them I doubt if I will be reading their group 

  From davefrackitUUCP Dave Ratcliffe
  
   What possible need would someone have for posting anonymously to a
   sci group 
   
   Sure most adults are willing to post under their own names Why
   would they want to hide behind an anonymous posting service
   Ashamed of what they have to say or just trying to rile people
   without fear of being identified 
   
   Anonymous posting have their place in CERTAIN groups If I or
   anyone else needs to tell you what those groups are then you've
   been on another planet breathing exotic gases for too long

  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   It's bloody fascinating that all the proponents of unimpeded
   universal anon posting access can't seem to find any middle
   ground at all  Why is there such a perception of
   absolutism Where does this instant gratification syndrome come
   from I want anon access and I want it NOW  Who are the
   control freaks here
  
  From acearlleobsuvcbsuedu

   Remember this is a newsgroup for posters writing about SCIENTIFIC
   issues Anonymous discussion of scientific issues leads to bad
   science

  From noringnetcomcom Jon Noring
  
   Though many have personal philosophical arguments against
   anonymous posters their arguments have not been compelling
   enough to convince me that omninewsgroup anonymous posting
   should be banned or severely restricted  Though I cannot prove
   it it seems to me that those who do not like anonymous posting
   in principle do so for reasons that are personal read
   psychological discomfort rather than for reasons related to
   maintaining the integrity of Usenet
   
   Remember it is impossible to be able to ascertain all the
   conceivable and legitimate motives for anonymous posting to
   newsgroups one normally would not deem to be sensitive  in
   general I fear even letting newsgroup readers vote on either
   allowing or not allowing anonymous posting since a priori they
   cannot know all the motives of legitimate posters and I do
   not believe that any system should ever be instituted that would
   inhibit the posting of legitimate and informative posts 

  lestatwixercactusorg Lyle J Mackey writes

   I personally don't believe that pseudonymous postings are
   appropriate in a serious discussion area  If there is a
   LEGITIMATE reason for concealing the posters' identity perhaps
   but simply because they're not so sure if they want their name
   attached doesn't qualify as LEGITIMATE in my book  Oh and if
   you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous postings
   please enlighten me

  sderbycrickssctrbcmtmcedu Stuart P Derby
  
   Three of our the US's founding fathers Madison Hamilton and
   Jay seemed to think anonymous posting was OK The Federalist
   papers were originally printed in New York newspapers with

   their purpose LEGITIMATE



 What should system operators do with anonymous postings

  From emcguireintellectioncom Ed McGuire
  
   I would like to know how to junk all articles posted by the
   anonymous service currently being discussed  Ideally I would
   actually tell my feed site not to feed me articles posted by the
   anonymous service Assuming the C News Performance Release what
   is a simple way to accomplish this Or where should I look to
   learn how to do it myself
  
  From dcluniepaxtpacomau David Clunie
  
   That's a bit draconian isn't it  Have your users unanimously
   decided that they would like you to do this or have you decided
   for them 
  
  From emcguireintellectioncom Ed McGuire
  
   Good question  Nobody has decided I have no definite plan to do
   this just wanted the technical data

  Carl Kleinpaste KarlKleinpastegodivanectarcscmuedu
  
   were I to be in the position of offering such a service again
   my promises of protection of anonymity would be limited  Not on
   the basis of personal opinion of what gets posted but on the
   basis of postings which disrupt the smooth operation of the
   Usenet The most obvious and direct recourse would be to out'
   the abusive individual Less drastic possibilities exist  the
   software supports a fire extinguisher by which individuals can
   be prevented from posting

  johniastateedu John Hascall
  
   Since when is Usenet a democracy If someone wants to run an
   anonymous service that's their business If you want to put
   that host in your killfile that's your business If a newsadmin
   wants to blanketdrop all postings from that site that's between
   them and the other people at that site If everyone ignores a
   service the service effectively doesn't exist

  From jikathenamitedu Jonathan I Kamens
  
   NNTP servers that allow posting from anyone are NOT a service to
   the net  They do the net a disservice
   
   Terminal servers have the same problems as open NNTP servers 
   they allow people who want to do illegalimmoralunethical things
   on the Internet to do so without accountability
   
   There are by now public access sites all over this country if
   not all over the world that allow very inexpensive access to the
   Usenet and the Internet  There is no reason for NNTP servers to
   allow anyone to post messages through them and there is no
   reason for terminal servers to allow anyone to connect to them
   and then make outbound connections through them  Perhaps when it
   was harder to get to the Internet or the Usenet open servers
   could be justified but not now

  jbotzmtholyokeedu Jurgen Botz 
  
   I think that what  these points show clearly is that an
   anonymous posting service has a great deal of responsibility
   both towards its clients and towards the Net as a whole  Such a
   service should IMHO have a set of welldefined rules and a
   contract that its clients should sign under the terms of which
   they are assured anonymity

  From ananonpenetfi
  
   Is the problem that some are used to punishing posters who are
   upsetting in some vague way by complaining to the usually
   acquiescent sysadmin or organizations that the poster belongs
   to That surely is the most gutless approach to solving
   problems but my experience on the net shows that the same users
   who vilify anonymous postings are the first to write obsessively
   detailed grievances to the poster's supervisor when his or her
   tranquility is disturbed by some intrusive or subversive post
   or another
   
   Anonymous postings prevent just this kind of intimidation

  From gandalfcyberspaceorg Eric Schilling
  
   The main point I would like to make here is that while we can go
   through and revise the news sw to reject anon posts to technical
   newsgroups or some such thing I think the attempt will prove
   futile Each attempt to modify news can result in a changed
   approach by anon service providers to thwart the change  I think
   this would be pointless

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius

   I have tried to stay out of this discussion and see where the
   discussion leads But now I rally feel like I have to speak up
    I have repeatedly made clear  that I do block users if
   they continue their abuse after having been warned In many cases
   the users have taken heed of the warning and stopped and in some
   cases even apologized in public And when the warning has not had
   the desired effect I have blocked a number of users I have also
   blocked access to groups where the readership has taken a vote to
   ban anonymous postings although I feel changing the newsgroup
   status to moderated is the only permanent solution for newsgroups
   that want to formalize discussion
 
  redredpollneoucomedu Richard E Depew

   Does this  mean that you are volunteering to issue a Request 
   For Discussion to ban anonymous postings or to moderate each of 
   the  newsgroups that your server can reach  I don't think 
   so but this illustrates the trouble that your server is causing
  
   please listen to the consensus of the news administrators in this 
   group  any newsgroup should be consulted before letting your 
   server post messages to that group
 
  From Cvmurzuniheidelbergde Alexander EICHENER
  
   There is no pompous consensus of the news administrators 
   here  maybe you would like to invent one There is a sizeable 
   number of people who are concerned about the possible and to a 
   minor extent about the actual abuse of the server as it is 
   configured now These concerns are respectable Johan is dealing
   with them  There are some few who rage with foam before 
   their mouth and condemn the service altogether And a number who
   defend it pointing out like Kate Gregory that even a group 
   like misckids can benefit from pseudonymous postings

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius

   I have answered a lot of personal mail related to server abuse
   and as a result of that blocked a number of abusive users I
   have also withdrawn the service from several newsgroups where the
   users have taken a vote on the issue I have not made any
   comments on newsadminpolicy partly because the
   newlyimplemented password feature as a emergency measure
   against a security hole has kept me really busy answering user
   queries the last two weeks and partly because I feel it is not
   for me to justify the service but for the users The problem
   with newsadminpolicy is that the readership is rather elective
   representing people whith a strong interest in centralised
   control

  From hartmanulogicUUCP Richard M Hartman
  
   This seems to be a rather bigoted attitude  I would consider that
   this group is for anyone who wishes to discuss how the net should
   be controlled  Saying that we only have an interest in
   centralized control is a clear indication of bias  You are
   perfectly welcome to join in the discussions here to promote your
   views on control

  jbuckohmberkeleyedu
  
   This whole debate is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing
   because even if you all decide to ban anonymous posting servers
   it is not enforceable  The only people who conceivably could
   enforce retrictions are those that control the international
   links
   
   Policy changes should be made by cooperation not by attempting
   to dictate you need to persuade those who run the services
   to act like this through friendly persuasion not by trying to
   beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you
   don't even have

  sppzabriskieberkeleyedu Steve Pope
  
   I am finding this bias against pseudonymity boring  Our friend
   posting through penet has a point  The old guard would like to
   keep their network the way it always has been and this new
   thing these pseudonymous servers cuts into their turf  So they
   whine and bitch about it and every time there's the slightest
   abuse such as somebody's sig being too long  they try to
   parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity
   
   I'll go on record as saying three cheers for the admins at anon
   servers like penet pax and nkbt and for all the  access
   service providers who are willing to preserve their clients
   privacy
   
   And a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity
  
  mimirsteinuwashingtonedu Al Billings
  
   I wouldn't help people get rid of anon postings as a group If you
   don't like what someone says then you put THAT anon address in
   your kill file not all of them Of course if and when I get an
   anon site going I'm just going to assign fake names like
   jsmith instead of anon to avoid most of the hassles
   You'll never know it is anonymous will you

  From annealcorconcordiaca Anne Bennett
  
   I must admit to some astonishment at this argument  I see the
   value of anonymous postings under some circumstances yet believe
   strongly that these should be identified as such so that people
   who do not wish to read material from people who won't identify
   themselves don't have to
   
   I fail to see what good you would be accomplishing and indeed
   surmise that you will cause many people inconvenience and
   annoyance by hiding the anonymity of postings from your
   anonymous site  Would you care to justify where the hell you get
   the gall to try to prevent people from effectively filtering
   their news as they see fit
  
  From dcluniepaxtpacomau David Clunie
  
   I thought I was out of reach here in Australia too Unfortunately
   one of the US sites involved in the USAus feed complained to the
   Australian Academic Reasearch Network through whom my site is
   connected not about anything in particular just the concept of
   anonymous mail having no redeeming features and consuming a
   narrow bandwidth link with which I can't argue and that was
   that  stop the service or face disconnection
  
   I consider the demise of my service to have been rather
   unfortunate and I wish the Finnish remailer luck  It is a pity
   that there are very few if any similar services provided with in
   the US I guess that's the benefit of having a constitution that
   guarantees one freedom of speech and a legal and political system
   that conspires to subvert it in the name of the public good



 What is going on with anonpenetfi run by J Helsingius


  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   Funny how beating the rest of the Usenet over the head with a
   stick is OK if it's anonpenetfi and universal anon access  But
   somehow people on the other side of the same equation not even
   arguing to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some
   control applied to the abuses that manifest themselves aren't
   allowed to do that
   
   I have written to Johan several times in the last couple of
   weeks  He used to reply to me quite readily After all I was
   the source of the software as originally delivered to him  he
   used to be downright prompt about replying to me Funny now
   he's being an impolite bastard who doesn't answer mail atall
   even when it consists of really very civil queries
  
  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius
  
   In your mail you told me you sent me one or more messages on Feb
   th Feb th and th the server was down and the flood of mail
   that resulted from the server coming up again crashed my own mail
   host The problem was aggregated by an abusive user sending
   thousands of messages to another user filling up that users
   mailbox The bounce messages ended up in my mailbox overflowing
   my local disk as well
   
   I can only suppose that your message got lost in that hassle as
   I have tried to answer as much as possible of the anonrelated
   messages I get from routine misaddessed messages to complaints
   about the service On the average I spend  hours per day
   answering anonrelated messages
  
  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   Why is it that everybody else has to put up with the impoliteness
   and insensitivity of the misuse of anonpenetfi  Whose
   definitions of polite and sense apply and why Why is
   universal anon access considered to be within the realm of this
   fuzzy concept of politeness in the first place
   
   I think Johan has long since crossed the line into being a rude
   bastard and I told him so in private mail a little while ago
   
   At this point I deeply regret a having created an anonymous
   system supporting  newsgroup and b having given the code to
   Johan  I didn't copyright it but I thought that some concept of
   politeness and good sense might follow it to new
   homes  Interesting that Johan's ideas of politeness and good
   sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine I could
   even cope with universal anon access if Johan would be willing
   to engage in abuse control but somehow that seems to be outside
   the range of reality

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius
  
   There is no way for me to convey how sad and upset your message
   made me I do to some extent understand your feelings but it
   still feels really bad Running the server requires getting used
   to a lot of flames but mindlessly abusive hate mail is so much
   easier to deal with than something like this as I do respect and
   value your views and opinions to a high degree No I'm not
   asking for sympathy I just wanted you to know that I am really
   giving your views quite a lot of weight
   
   When I asked for the software I was actually only going to
   provide the service to scandinavian users But a lot of people
   requested that I keep the service open to the international
   community I now realize that I ought to have contacted you at
   that point to ask how you feel about me using your stuff in such
   a context Again I really want to apologise And I will replace
   the remaining few pieces of code thet still stem from your
   system Unfortunately there is no way to remove the ideas and
   structure I got from you
   
   Again I am really sorry that the results of your work ended up
   being used in a way that you don't approve of And I will be
   giving a lot of hard thought to the possibility of shutting down
   the server alltogether
  
  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   I think I'm feeling especially rude and impolite  If it's good
   for Johan it's good for me  After all he didn't ask the
   greater Usenet whether universal anon access was a good idea he
   just did it  Yes I'm a seriously rude pain in the ass now
   and I think I'll arm the Usenet Death Penalty slightly modified
   not for strategic wholesite attack but tactical assault just
   ananonpenetfi destruction Only outside alt too
   let's say
   
   To parrot this linepeople have been doing things like the UDP
   that is cancelling others' postings for years no one could
   ever stop them and it's only politeness and good sense that has
   prevented them up to now
   
   In fact I have  people who have expressed privately the desire
   and ability to arm the UDP
   
   
   
   PS No in fact there are not  newsadmins ready to arm the
   UDP  It would be amusing to know how many people gulped hard
   when they read that though  I don't see it as any different
   from Johan's configuration
   
   PPS Now that I've calmed some fears by the above PS  There
   are  newsadmins ready to arm the UDP  They've asked for my
   code  I haven't sent it yet Only one site would be necessary
   to bring anonpenetfi to a screeching halt  Anyone can
   implement the UDP on their own if they care to  Politeness and
   good sense prevents them from doing so I wonder how long before
   one form of impoliteness brings on another form

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius
  
   It would be trivially easy to bring anonpenetfi to a screeching
   halt In fact it has happened a couple of times already But as
   we are talking threats here let me make one as well A very
   simple one If somebody uses something like the UDP or
   maliciously brings down anonpenetfi by some other means it
   will stay down But I will let the users know why And name the
   person who did it OK As somebody said on this thread You have
   to take personal responsibility for your actions right
  
  From avscccamdahlcom    Atul V Salgaonkar
  
   I am very grateful and appreciative of this service  courtesey of
   penetfi  Some important questions about my personal
   lifecareerjob were resolved due to kind help of other people
   who had been thru similar situations In return I have also
   replied to anon postings where I thought I could make a positive
   contribution
   
   In general anon service is a great in my opinion although like
   any tool some people will not use it responsibly I suggest that
   it should be kept alive Wasting bandwidth is less important than
   saving lives I think
  
  From usmmmsercmcom Elisa J Collins
  
   I have been informed that the anonymous posting service to many
   newsgroups has been turned off as a result of discussions in this
   newsgroup over people abusing it
   
   I had been posting to a nontechnical misc newsgroup about an
   intimate topic for which I felt I required privacy I have
   received immeasurable help from the people in that newsgroup and
   I have never used anonymity to behave in an abusive immature or
   unethical fashion toward anyone
   
   Please folks believe me I need this service  Please
   consider my point of view and permit adminanonpenetfi to turn
   the service back on
   
   Thank you

It is and you are wrong yet you emotionally state a bunch of crap as fact
with a tiny disclaimer at the end  Check your facts first and grow up
Why is there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography
and immaturity I wonder

Oh I see flame someone tell them that they are immature tell them
they are wrong and then don't offer any proof for your assertions

It has actually come up or it will in a week or two in NZ  I'll post the

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary



For Immediate Release                           April  


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and
law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

A stateoftheart microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has
been developed by government engineers  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology  It can be used in new
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

A keyescrow system will be established to ensure that the
Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of lawabiding
Americans  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                


keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the
device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately
in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap

The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices  In addition respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
approaches that can both provide lawabiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches like the keyescrow system
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates

        the privacy of our citizens including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes

        the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data under proper court or other legal
          order when necessary to protect our citizens

        the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace and 

        the need of US companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed



                                

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information  This infrastructure of highspeed networks
information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV
programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available  

For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of
Standards and Technology  




QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations

A   No  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans

Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message

A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
     court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system

Q   Who will run the keyescrow data banks

A   The two keyescrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities  At this point the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the keyescrow data banks

Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is  

A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities

Q   Whose decision was it to propose this product

A   The National Security Council the Justice Department the
     Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet
     officials

Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative

Q   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers

A   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them

Q   Who provides the Clipper Chip

A   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance
     California and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future

Q   How do I buy one of these encryption devices 

A   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the Clipper Chip into their devices
     
Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure more convenient and less expensive
     than others readily available today but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology which the Administration is
     developing

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

Q   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration  

A   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and publicinterest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism

Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware

A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements  Casebycase review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices  The
     same is true for other encryption devices  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to US companies operating at home and abroad  With this
     in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     casebycase basis for US companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products

I'm not a lawyer so correct me if I'm wrong but doing that could be
considered obstruction of justice which could land you in prison for
quite a while

The thing that's great about the secret key is it is IDEA encrypted so
even if the FBI do get the key they're SOL unless they know the magic
word  If they try to force you to give them your pass phrase just say
Oops I forgot  Since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution
in this country if you keep your mouth shut how can they prove that you
didn't forget your pass phrase


Well I'm no lawyer but I'll supply some ancedotal evidence which may
change your mind   Note  I do not agree AT ALL with what went on in
this case and neither will most of you  THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT 
THAT IT DID HAPPEN  Right here in America even

About three or four years ago there was a rather nasty custody case in
or around Washington DC  The upshot was an exhusband was suing for 
visitation rights which were granted  The woman believed that the man
had been sexually molesting her children  much like AllenFarrow but
not as famous  Anyhows she spirits away the kids and refuses to tell the
court where they are and denies him visitation rights

She keeps her mouth shut and what happens  She SITS IN JAIL for almost
a year on CONTEMPT OF COURT until the legislature passes a special law
limiting the time a person can be held  If they hadn't passed the law she'd
most likely still be there  The kids were in New Zealand I belive

Now story finished commetary starting  IMHO the only reason the
legislature moved was because there was an outpouring of public sympathy
for this woman  most people believed she was right and were outraged
Not likely to happen for Joe Random Drug Dealer Child Molester or perfectly
innocent privacy lover who might have something
to hide  Innocent until proven guilty doesn't mean you get to walk out
of court humming a happy tune because the FBI can't read your disk  Just
ask those held for contempt those who can't make bail etc etc

Again I disagree totally with the concept of holding someone based
on suspicion but people who keep thinking that it won't happen are bound
to get a rude shock when it does
 

 Also not a lawyer etc but if I remember correctly the Contempt of Court
business is used in order to compel cooperation with what is perhaps
questionably different issue the legitimate business of that court Quite
literally the party is found guilty of holding the court in contempt Now
the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if
certain threatening conditions are met Once the key is gone there is no
question of Contempt of Court as there is nothing to compell the key is no
longer there to be produced

  Obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in
question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes
however extenuated I think that this charge would be a hard nut to make 

  Perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up

Well it now seems obvious what Professor Denning was doing last fall
when this key escrow trial balloon was raised

All the more need for endtoend encryption schemes that bypass the
governmentapproved system

By the way the Clipper nameisn't this already used for the
Clipper processor from Intergraph I doubt they're the ones making the
chip so a name conflict may be present

	I have a bunch of questions about the encryption scheme
referenced in the Subject of this message  What is the relative data
privacy provided by the above sequence as compared with straight DES
Does the addition of compression then encrypting make the cyphertext
significantly harder to crack using current methods than straight DES
Would running crypt after DES provide greater data privacy  Is it
important to remove the constant compress header before encryption
Thank you net for your wisdom

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary



For Immediate Release                           April  


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and
law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

A stateoftheart microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has
been developed by government engineers  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology  It can be used in new
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

A keyescrow system will be established to ensure that the
Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of lawabiding
Americans  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                


keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the
device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately
in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap

The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices  In addition respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
approaches that can both provide lawabiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches like the keyescrow system
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates

        the privacy of our citizens including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes

        the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data under proper court or other legal
          order when necessary to protect our citizens

        the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace and 

        the need of US companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed



                                

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information  This infrastructure of highspeed networks
information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV
programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available

Standards and Technology  




QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations

A   No  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans

Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message

A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
     court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system

Q   Who will run the keyescrow data banks

A   The two keyescrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities  At this point the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the keyescrow data banks

Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is  

A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities

Q   Whose decision was it to propose this product

A   The National Security Council the Justice Department the
     Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet
     officials

Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative

Q   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers

A   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them

Q   Who provides the Clipper Chip

A   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance
     California and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future

Q   How do I buy one of these encryption devices 

A   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the Clipper Chip into their devices
     
Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure more convenient and less expensive
     than others readily available today but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology which the Administration is
     developing

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

Q   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration  

A   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and publicinterest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism

Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware

A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements  Casebycase review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices  The
     same is true for other encryption devices  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to US companies operating at home and abroad  With this
     in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     casebycase basis for US companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products

May as well look at one piece of this at a time  This paragraph

Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new

the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report

means they aren't planning to make it public as was done with DES  As it
says in both scicrypt FAQs there's no way we are going to achieve the
same level of comfort with Clipper that we finally have with DES if we
can't actually get our hands on the bits and watch them flow around  Even
the best experts aren't going to think of everything look how long it
took Biham and Shamir to get a handle on just how good DES is and for
all we know there's still more to learn

I am postive someone will correct me if I am wrong but doesn't the Fifth
also cover not being forced to do actions that are selfincriminating
From Mike Godwin mnemonicefforg posted with permission  Carl

No but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where as it
happens evidence that will convict you is stored 

The cryptokey disclosure issue hasn't come up yet but current law
suggests that it's a loser for the defendanthe'll be compelled to turn
over the key

The test for compelled selfincrimination is whether the material to 
be disclosed in itself tends to inculpate the discloser In the example
I gave above the safe key itself has no testimonial valueergo it can
be disclosed under compulsion eg subpoena duces tecum

Moreover the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
keycompelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you Of course they
can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
you
Mike

    Lets carry this one step further Suppose the text of the key is
in itself conclusive evidence of the SAME CRIME for which the
encrypted material is further evidence I find myself envisaging a
scenario like this

You have made some scans of Peanuts strips You encrypt them The key
is a phrase

The Comic Police haul you in They seize your system They find the
encrypted file

CP    Whats that file

You   I take the fifth

CP    What's the keyphrase to that file 

You   I take the fifth

Judge You have to reveal the keyphrase I disagree but I'm not a judge

You   Your Honor revealing the keyphrase in it's own right would 
	tend to incriminate me of breaking laws independent of what 
	may or may not be in the encrypted file  

Judge I grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key
	itself

You    The keyphrase is I confess to deliberately evading copyright 
	the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of 
        copyrighted Peanuts strips

Judge and CP Oh

     How will they get you now I'm not saying that they won't or
can't or even that they shouldn't  but what legal mechanism will
they use Should we be crossposting this to misclegal

clippercsrcncslnistgov Clipper Chip Announcement writes

 The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
 the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
 program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
 communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
 enforcement

A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption
devices with builtin trapdoors  just like the Feds wanted

 For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
 private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
 tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
 protecting Americans  Rather than use technology to accommodate
 the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and
 law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against
 industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement

Blabla

 protect electronic mail and computer files  While encryption
 technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
 unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
 by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

Indeed and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter

 an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications
 using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
 commercial use today

This doesn't say much There are many incredibly weak encryption
algorithms in commercial use today

 This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
 information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
 and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
 electronically

Except from the government

  At the same time this technology preserves the
 ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
 intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

Nope The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip
they'll use something secure This technology provides only means to
intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to
use it

 agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the
 device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately
 in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the
 Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to
 government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
 wiretap

That is the government has the keys It doesn't matter much if they
are in one or in two of its hands

 The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no
 new authorities to access the content of the private
 conversations of Americans

Correct It does however provide those Americans with the false
sense of privacy

 devices  In addition respected experts from outside the
 government will be offered access to the confidential details of
 the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
 their findings

If the screening is not public it cannot be trusted Some people do
not trust DES even today after all the examinations  only because
some parts of its design were kept secret

 The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
 encryption's dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
 privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
 criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
 approaches that can both provide lawabiding citizens with access
 to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
 to hide their illegal activities  In order to assess technology

So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal
activities So will those lawabiding citizens who do not trust their
government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations

         the privacy of our citizens including the need to
           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes

Except from the government

         the need of US companies to manufacture and export
           high technology products

Huh Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted

 Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
 role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
 quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
 its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
 protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
 them from those who break the law

In short the new technology can

 Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper

It cannot

 Protect him from the government if it decides to misuse its
ability to decrypt the conversations

 Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new
encryption scheme or to steal the keys or to bribe the people who
handle them etc

 Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for
communication

 Q   Does this approach expand the authority of government
      agencies to listen in on phone conversations

 A   No  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with
      no new authorities to access the content of the private
      conversations of Americans

Correct However it does not provide them that much privacy as it
claims

 Q   Who will run the keyescrow data banks

 A   The two keyescrow data banks will be run by two independent
      entities  At this point the Department of Justice and the
      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
      oversee the keyescrow data banks

Two candidates the NSA and the Mafia

 Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
      how strong the security is  

 A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
      systems readily available today 

That is trust us

 While the algorithm will
      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow

Security through obscurity

      system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
      potential users that there are no unrecognized
      vulnerabilities

If it's not entirely open to public examination it cannot be
trusted Besides who can prove that the devices used for examination
and the ones built into your phones will be the same

 Q   Whose decision was it to propose this product

 A   The National Security Council the Justice Department the

The NSA and the FBI

 Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

 A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
      encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
      as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
      decisions related to this initiative

Why did they forget the Academia

 Q   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers

 A   The government designed and developed the key access
      encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the
      microcircuits to product manufacturers  Product
      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
      manufacturer that produces them

Doesn't this smell to monopolism

 Q   Who provides the Clipper Chip

 A   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance
      California and will sell the chip to encryption device
      manufacturers  The programming function could be licensed
      to other vendors in the future

Like the Mafia

 Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
      solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
      powerful encryption devices

This is the main question why was it buried at the end

 A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
      considered during the broad policy review  The key escrow

We'll see

      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
      that is more secure more convenient and less expensive
      than others readily available today but it is just one

Trust us

      The Administration is not saying since encryption
      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
      we will prohibit it outright as some countries have

In short If we decide to outlaw strong crypto we'll tell you

      effectively done nor is the US saying that every
      American as a matter of right is entitled to an
      unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a

Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions
and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American
to bear arms why is not every American entitled as a matter of
right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product

 A   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
      technology in telecommunications and computing and are
      committed to working with industry and publicinterest
      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
      privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law
      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
      and terrorism

Bullshit The proposed technology provides a false sense of security
encryption devices with builtin capabilities for breaking the
encryption does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto and
is a step to outlaw strong crypto

 Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
      the government hardware

 A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
      requirements  Casebycase review for each export is
      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices  The

Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will
leave the export controls on strong crypto devices

OK I'm not American it's not my business but I just couldn't resist
to comment The whole plot looks so totalitaristic It's up to
you Americans to fight for your rights

The key question is whether nonClipper encryption will be made illegal

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans
have the right to Clipper encryption but not to unbreakable encryption
This implies that ultimately nonClipper strong encryption must become
illegal

As an aside isn't the language here jarring  All this talk about
harmonious balance when they're talking about taking away people's
right to communications privacy

Although the article emphasizes voice communication data and mail encryption
is mentioned as well

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files

        the privacy of our citizens including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes

It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals
are coming true  If the government continues on this course I imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal  Encryption programs
for disk files and email as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications will be distributed only through the
underground  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy

It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here

ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

A keyescrow system will be established to ensure that the
Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of lawabiding
Americans  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                


keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the
device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately
in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap

The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices  In addition respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
approaches that can both provide lawabiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches like the keyescrow system
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates

        the privacy of our citizens including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes

        the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data under proper court or other legal
          order when necessary to protect our citizens

        the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace and 

        the need of US companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed



                                

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information  This infrastructure of highspeed networks
information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV
programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations

A   No  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans

Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message

A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
     court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system

Q   Who will run the keyescrow data banks

A   The two keyescrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities  At this point the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the keyescrow data banks

Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is  

A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities

Q   Whose decision was it to propose this product

A   The National Security Council the Justice Department the
     Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet
     officials

Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative

Q   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers

A   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them

Q   Who provides the Clipper Chip

A   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance
     California and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future

Q   How do I buy one of these encryption devices 

A   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the Clipper Chip into their devices
     
Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure more convenient and less expensive
     than others readily available today but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology which the Administration is
     developing

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

Q   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration  

A   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and publicinterest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism

Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware

A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements  Casebycase review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices  The
     same is true for other encryption devices  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to US companies operating at home and abroad  With this
     in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     casebycase basis for US companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products

INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL

The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on
cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of
millions of Americans  The first part of the plan is to begin a
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as
export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to
robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology

However EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already
reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any
public comment or discussion has been allowed  Apparently the
Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the
National Security Agency  The socalled Clipper Chip is an bit
split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips
manufactured by a military contractor  Two separate escrow agents would
store users' keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon
presentation of a valid warrant  The encryption scheme used is to be
classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for
incorporation into its communications products

     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns 

First the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an
inquiry  The NSAdeveloped Clipper Chip may not be the most secure
product Other vendors or developers may have better schemes
Furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for
the Clipper or any other chips  Rather independent chip manufacturers
should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards

Second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested Yet the
Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified  EFF
believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open  The
public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is
open to independent expert scrutiny  

Third while the use of the use of a splitkey dual escrowed system may
prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement
needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is
adopted  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys 
Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth
Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries  These are but a few
of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to
answer

In sum the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance
of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy
and security  However the Clipper Chip solution ought to be
considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the
discussion even begins

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL

ESCROW

The bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom
hold bits of each key  The manufacturer of the communications device
would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow
agents  A key is tied to the device however not the person using it

Upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would
have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents  According to
the Presidential Directive just issued the Attorney General will be
asked to identify appropriate escrow agents  Some in the Administration
have suggested that one nonlaw enforcement federal agency perhaps the
Federal Reserve and one nongovernmental organization could be chosen
but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet

CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS

The Administration claims that there are no back doors  means by which
the government or others could break the code without securing keys from
the escrow agents  and that the President will be told there are no
back doors to this classified algorithm  In order to prove this
Administration sources are interested in arranging for an allstar crypto
cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the
algorithm for trap doors  The results of the investigation would then be
made public

The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a solesource
secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private
firms  VLSI and Mycotronx  NSA work on this plan has been underway for
about four years  The manufacturing contract was let  months ago

GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER

In order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes
in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers
for this product  Users will include the FBI Secret Service VP Al
Gore and maybe even the President  At today's Commerce Department press
briefing a number of people asked this question though  why would any
private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had
no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors

COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY

The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an
inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption
and law enforcement  The items to be considered include  export
controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony
Proposal  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the
National Security Council  Unfortunately however the Presidential
Directive describing the inquiry is classified  Some public involvement
in the process has been promised but they terms have yet to be specified

I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of
cryptographic data and encrypted messages given the first admendment
the theory behind regulating the personal encryption of one's personal
thoughts and feelings seems even less tenable

Perhaps if we make a treaty with say Iceland to restrict crypto
paraphernalia can a good end run around the Constitution happen
Treaties  as someone pointed out  has the force of any other law of
the land  Like the Bill of Rights


    Amendment 

    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech
or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances

    Amendment 

    A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed

    Amendment 

    No Soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the
consent of the Owner nor in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed
by law

    Amendment 

    The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and
effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated
and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by Oath or
affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the
persons or things to be seized

    Amendment 

    No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous
crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury except in
cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the Militia when in
actual service in time of War or public danger nor shall any person be
subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb
nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process
of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation


Well  at least for a few minutes we had some privacy

I have read the FAQ and followed the recent discussion on Rubicks
Cube but I don't believe this question has been answered  Notice
that I am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the 
SHORTEST path not just any solution

It seems to me that the underlying assumption is that such a program

seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and I want to 
know if someone has significantly improved on that

Note     The following was released by the White House today in
          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip
          encryption technology

                           FACT SHEET

                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The President has approved a directive on Public Encryption
Management  The directive provides for the following

Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption
are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology 
Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of
communications and data by preventing unauthorized access 
Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to
rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications 
These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the
information age

Despite its benefits new communications technology can also
frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance  Sophisticated
encryption can have this effect in the United States  When
exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
activities critical to our national interests  In the past it has
been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law
enforcement and national security interests while at the same time
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens  As
encryption technology improves doing so will require new
innovative approaches

In the area of communications encryption the U S Government has
developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through
encryption that is substantially more robust than the current
government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed
to unlock the encryption  The system for the escrowing of keys
will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information
only with appropriate legal authorization

To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect
and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmitted
information I hereby direct the following action to be taken

INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENTDEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS

The Attorney General of the United States or her representative
shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
incorporates encryption to install the US governmentdeveloped
keyescrow microcircuits in their products  The fact of law
enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from
the American public  All appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the keyescrow
microcircuit are made widely available to US communications
hardware manufacturers consistent with the need to ensure the
security of the keyescrow system  In making this decision I do
not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the
government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that
are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key
escrow system

KEYESCROW

The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the keyescrow microcircuits
installed in communications equipment  In each case the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys  The keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established their authority to
acquire the content of those communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits  The Attorney
General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications

PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES

The Secretary of Commerce in consultation with other appropriate
US agencies shall initiate a process to write standards to
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with keyescrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information  I expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive 

The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications  Further the Attorney General
shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase

		yes let's protect the voice network

		privatelydeveloped crypto has always been available and
		always will be  so let's think about how to do law
		enforcement given that fact not about how to hope to
		legislate against it

		my needs for crypto as a system designer are not met by the
		Clipper Chip  I want freely to export uses of algorithms
		like DES  RSA which are already freely available in the
		destination country

Though some may argue about the nose of the camel it's worth noting that
the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony If it is only
used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file
encryption then it IS an improvement over the current massproduced
standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to
easytobreak inverters

Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap
Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
email and files let's focus on this

One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it

Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some I find the proposal
less threatening than many others since right now most Americans have no
secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can
eavesdrop This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and
cordless phones



Reading between the lines I infer that the system is highly secure
without access to the keys This would meet the needs of US businesses
confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including French and Japanese
security services and rich Japanese companies It allows the NSA to make
available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs

Most legitimate US corporations trust the NSA and would be delighted to
have a highsecurity system certified by them even at the price of
depositing keys in escrow I see no difficulty in creating a reliable
escrow Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the
week and that system has worked pretty well

From my point of view this is a fair starting point There are concerns that
need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows But in
return we get access to highsecurity crypto Many have suggested that DES
and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly
skilled and endowed There is at least a good possibility which should be
checked that the proposed system is not so breakable It doesn't have to
be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys
pursuant to a legitimate court order Thus they can protect legitimate
communications against economic adversaries while still being able to
eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order



In discussing this let's try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and
noise of some previous threads This is a substantive and technical issue
and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion

The bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom

Presumably the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy
of the key and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from
both agents

However if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation
of the other agent a bit key is not going to stand in the way of a
brute force attack  If an agency for example the NSA were to hold one
of the two keyhalves then I don't imagine they really need the other half of

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic ie In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank

I can imagine the ciphertext exhibiting certain statistical
characteristics that might give a clue as to the encryption technique
used but not enough to give a handle for diferential cryptoanalysis
However superencipherment or some other scheme that shapes the percieved
properties of my ciphertext could thwart this

The key question is whether nonClipper encryption will be made illegal

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every

Does anyone know what countries are these

     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans
have the right to Clipper encryption but not to unbreakable encryption
This implies that ultimately nonClipper strong encryption must become
illegal

With the following logical consequences
	a Using any code designed to obscure informatio which is 
	    not easily breakable will be illegal including
		i Using code words such as Project P''
		ii Speaking a language other than English
		iii Ever refering implicitly to events not known to
			everyone eg
			Hi John How was last night
		      For all the listener knows this may be a code for
			Did you pick up the drugs OK last night
		      of be a code for
		        OK We blow up the Pentagon at midnight
		iv Mentioning anything that could not be perfectly

		v Words with more than one syllable
		vi Speaking with a heavy accent that could bemisunderstood
		     by people not used to it
		vii books with an Inner meaningsuch
		      as Animal Farm

As an aside isn't the language here jarring  All this talk about
harmonious balance when they're talking about taking away people's
right to communications privacy

Yes

It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals
are coming true  If the government continues on this course I imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal  Encryption programs
for disk files and email as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications will be distributed only through the
underground  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy

I have a wonderful encrypter you can borrow that converts a message
eg Meet me at  to bomb the White House Bring some dynamite
to an apparently relatively innoculous message This message
here is an example of the output for the above message 

It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here

It is shockiong that it could happen anywhere
It is shocking that it could happen in a country 
that has the arrogance to call itself free

What you can do
	 Write to your congress person in plain text
	 Write to your congress person in encrypted text
		decrypter optional
	 Send some random keystroked to your congressperson
	 Send some random keystrokes accross the US boundaries
		and keep the spooks busy trying to decode it
	 Write your own encryption algorithms
	 Don't buy clipper products

PS I can't work out why the US government doesn't want to sell
them overseas After all they are rather easy for US interests to decode
so make a perfect tool for industrialmilitary espionagelulling 
anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security You will
notice that there is NO mention anywhere about safety for nonAmericans

I have nothing that I particularly want to hide at the momentthough I 
consider the right
to be able to use whatever method of coding data I like to be high on my
list of priorities

               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC 
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

	Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility CPSR 
today called for the public disclosure of technical data 
underlying the government's newlyannounced Public Encryption 
Management initiative  The new cryptography scheme was 
announced today by the White House and the National Institute 
for Standards and Technology NIST which will implement the 
technical specifications of the plan  A NIST spokesman 
acknowledged that the National Security Agency NSA the super
secret military intelligence agency had actually developed the 
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built

	According to NIST the technical specifications and the 
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified  To 
open the initiative to public review and debate CPSR today 
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests 
with key agencies including NSA NIST the National Security 
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption 
plan  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the 
Computer Security Act which Congress passed in  in order to 
open the development of nonmilitary computer security standards 
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of 
such standards

	CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in 
developing the socalled digital signature standard DSS a 
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for 
governmentwide use in   After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA 
lawsuit last year the civilian agency disclosed for the first 
time that NSA had in fact developed that security standard  
NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying 
the classification of records concerning its creation of the 
DSS

	David Sobel CPSR Legal Counsel called the 
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of 
electronic communications as reflected in today's official 
statement  a step in the right direction  But he questioned 
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent 
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from 
public scrutiny  At a time when we are moving towards the 
development of a new information infrastructure it is vital 
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be 
established openly and with full public participation  It is 
not appropriate for NSA  an agency with a long tradition of 
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography  to 
play a leading role in the development process

 Some limitation  Let me guess  don't use the code in any way PKP or
 RSA doesn't likesuch asproviding secure communications for the
 average citizen

That was exactly its purpose if you know anything about it  There is
nothing at all preventing the average citizen using it only selling
it

FACT  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license
to do so from PKP whether or not one is charging for it  Furthermore
any use of RSA other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law is similarly unlawful  Therefore the average citizen cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP

There is no licensed freely available product in the US that uses RSA
encryption other than RSAREF and hence RIPEM at least as far as I am
aware  If you know of another please post it here

 All I have to say isyeah right  If you're willing to pay them
 mucho big bucks andor use the routines they tell you to do  
 Doesn't sound very reasonable to me

All I have to say is this is full of shit  I have negotiated a license
and the bucks are incredibly reasonable with an upfront charge on a
sliding scale depending on your capitalization  If you are a startup
and can't afford it you can't afford to start up in the first place
Why do people insist on making unequivocal statements about that which
they know nothing

FACT  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security Inc was with some
guy trying to sell me a license unsolicited I might add for TIPEM
Cost K plus  percent royalties

I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count
as mucho bucks or incredibly reasonable  Either way however this
definitely falls into the routines they tell you to use

 But I don't guess PKP and RSA are interested in big bucks  Maybe
 they have some other agenda  Secure communications only for 
 government agents perhaps

Have you considered treatment for paranoia  The government is the
single biggest thorn in RSA's side

FACT  There are no restrictions yet on the use of cryptography under
US law although this is beginning to look like it will change  The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's
patents

it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply

 Now
 the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if
 certain threatening conditions are met Once the key is gone there is no
 question of Contempt of Court as there is nothing to compell the key is no
 longer there to be produced

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on
a communications link as opposed to storage where the keys have to be
retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the
data

The right way to do communications security is to generate a random
session key with Diffie Hellman use it for a while and then destroy
it Once it's gone there's no getting it back and no way to decrypt
recordings of the conversation

To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle you
have to authenticate your DH exchanges The ATT secure phone does
this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over
the phone This is nice and simple but it relies on user awareness
plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'
voices

A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA Since you'd
never use RSA for actual encryption compromising your RSA secret key
would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation
and even that only until you revoke your public key  They would still
not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the
session keys have been destroyed

I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones
the STUIII must work Neat eh

Okay let's suppose that the NSANISTMykotronix Registered
Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system
from my local radio shack Every phone comes with a built in
chip and the government has the key to every phone call 
I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key 

What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or 
buying a used phone at a garage sale Whooa The secret registered
keys just became unsynchronized When the government comes 
to listen in they only receive gobbledlygook because the 
secret key registered under my name isn't the right one 

That leads me to conjecture that

 The system isn't that secure There are just two master keys
that work for all the phones in the country The part about
registering your keys is just bogus 

or 

 The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks
like this Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to
town

In either case I think we need to look at this a bit deeper'jblmWwxlD

	I was thinking about this also It's quite possible the
system transmits in clear the serial number of the device being
used That way they can start a tap get the serial number and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key

	If they tap someone who's apparently using encryption but
don't find that prefix then they'll assume it's an unauthorized
encryption scheme

As of yet there has been no description of the general principles
behind the Clipper proposal For example is this a public key system
or a private key system If the latter then I don't see how the
system could work given that the keys are tied to the device and
not the person

Further the escrowed bit keys are split into two bit chunks
I would guess that the availability of one of these bit chunks
and a reasonable keysearch machine would allow you to read the traffic
I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system
but it does make you think Of course this is easily fixable by 
giving out two bit chunks which could be xored to generate the 
real bit key

PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES

  

The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications  Further the Attorney General
shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase


Talk about adding insult to injury  

I for one believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration not continued  Instead it looks like that
illgotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment

Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation etc
        
                            Great nice choice of bad guys to
                            convince everyone how bad unrestricted
                            encryption is  Why not use a child
                            molester instead  Of course the word
                            suspect is never used here so I guess
                            these people have already been convicted
                            and are operating this drug ring from
                            their jail cells

How about this question instead

Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a political opponent of a senior administration official and
     intercepts a conversation

Kinda changes your interpretation of the event doesn't it  And yes
the presence of the Clipper Chip DOES change things because it will
not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security
it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification
to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them
Dang it all it's SUPPOSED to be inconvenient but not impossible
That's the ONLY sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while
still allowing legitimate law enforcement access


Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is  

A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities

Uh huh sure  I predict that within two months weeks of the chip's
debut the full technical details will be posted to scicrypt  And if
this has ANY impact on the security of the key escrow system then we've
been lied to  Any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light
of public scrutiny and there is NO WAY you can be sure that an
algorithm has no unrecognized vulnerabilities unless you have half
the world trying to break it for a decade or so  Even then you gotta
be careful

 I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
 people who designed the system  Why on the Earth split the
 bit key in bit parts to keep them in escrow separately
 having  bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
 it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply
 could keep bit sequences in N N independent places
 and then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key N
 sequences should obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the
 actual key XORed with the random sequences

Without real technical details it's hard to answer this question But
suppose they already are XORing the two bit parts to produce only
 bits of real key material Maybe they're using the exportable version
of RC

			    THE WHITE HOUSE

		     Office of the Press Secretary

   

   For Immediate Release                           April  


		   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
   the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
   program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
   communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
   enforcement

   The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
   accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
   telecommunications networks and wireless communications links

   For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
   private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
   tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
   protecting Americans  Rather than use technology to accommodate
   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and
   law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against
   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement

   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
   protect electronic funds transfer  It is now being used to
   protect electronic mail and computer files  While encryption
   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
   unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
   by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

   A stateoftheart microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has
   been developed by government engineers  The chip represents a
   new approach to encryption technology  It can be used in new
   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
   an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications
   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
   commercial use today

   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
   information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
   electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the
   ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

   A keyescrow system will be established to ensure that the
   Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of lawabiding
   Americans  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


				   


   keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government
   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the
   device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately
   in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the
   Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to
   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
   wiretap

   The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no
   new authorities to access the content of the private
   conversations of Americans

   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the
   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
   devices  In addition respected experts from outside the
   government will be offered access to the confidential details of
   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
   their findings

   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
   encryption's dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
   privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
   criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
   approaches that can both provide lawabiding citizens with access
   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
   to hide their illegal activities  In order to assess technology
   trends and explore new approaches like the keyescrow system
   the President has directed government agencies to develop a
   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates

	   the privacy of our citizens including the need to
	     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes

	   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
	     calls and data under proper court or other legal
	     order when necessary to protect our citizens

	   the effective and timely use of the most modern
	     technology to build the National Information
	     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
	     the competitiveness of American industry in the global
	     marketplace and 

	   the need of US companies to manufacture and export
	     high technology products

   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
   affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the
   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed



				   

   The Administration is committed to working with the private
   sector to spur the development of a National Information
   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
   information  This infrastructure of highspeed networks
   information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV
   programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
   system transmits voice

   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
   role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
   quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
   its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
   protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
   them from those who break the law

   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet 
   The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
   encryption technology are also available  

   For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of
   Standards and Technology  

   


   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




   Q   Does this approach expand the authority of government
	agencies to listen in on phone conversations

   A   No  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with
	no new authorities to access the content of the private
	conversations of Americans

   Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
	a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
	encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
	decipher the message

   A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
	court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
	would then present documentation of this authorization to
	the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
	obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
	smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
	stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
	escrow system

   Q   Who will run the keyescrow data banks

   A   The two keyescrow data banks will be run by two independent
	entities  At this point the Department of Justice and the
	Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
	oversee the keyescrow data banks

   Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
	how strong the security is  

   A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
	systems readily available today  While the algorithm will
	remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
	system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
	cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
	potential users that there are no unrecognized
	vulnerabilities

   Q   Whose decision was it to propose this product

   A   The National Security Council the Justice Department the
	Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in
	this decision  This approach has been endorsed by the
	President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet
	officials

   Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

   A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
	encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
	as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
	briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
	decisions related to this initiative

   Q   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers

   A   The government designed and developed the key access
	encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the
	microcircuits to product manufacturers  Product
	manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
	manufacturer that produces them

   Q   Who provides the Clipper Chip

   A   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance
	California and will sell the chip to encryption device
	manufacturers  The programming function could be licensed
	to other vendors in the future

   Q   How do I buy one of these encryption devices 

   A   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
	the Clipper Chip into their devices

   Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
	solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
	willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
	powerful encryption devices

   A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
	considered during the broad policy review  The key escrow
	mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
	that is more secure more convenient and less expensive
	than others readily available today but it is just one
	piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
	encryption technology which the Administration is
	developing

	The Administration is not saying since encryption
	threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
	we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
	effectively done nor is the US saying that every
	American as a matter of right is entitled to an
	unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
	false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
	an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
	and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
	balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
	Chip and similar encryption techniques

   Q   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
	Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
	that of the Bush Administration  

   A   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
	technology in telecommunications and computing and are
	committed to working with industry and publicinterest
	groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
	privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law
	enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
	and terrorism

   Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
	the government hardware

   A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
	requirements  Casebycase review for each export is
	required to ensure appropriate use of these devices  The
	same is true for other encryption devices  One of the
	attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
	to US companies operating at home and abroad  With this
	in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a
	casebycase basis for US companies seeking to use these
	devices to secure their own communications abroad  We plan
	to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
	of these products

This may be a stupid question but how does the government know which keys
to ask for

Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones faxes modems etc
and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number
Will there be penalities if the public does not do this  Will identification
the National Health Care ID perhaps be required when purchasing a
Clipperequipted phone

Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of
a conversation  Identification which could be used to automatically
log who calls whom  The phone company keeps records but this 
information would be accessable by a wellplaced van near a microwave
relay station

This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications
encryption key  Will it be something that is derived from information
exchanged at the start of the conversation  and hence derivable by
an eavesdropper

The stragegy of the government is interesting  The real fear comes from
them doing more than this

This is a voluntary program and thus harder for us to object to on
the surface

Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one  They are
pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they
get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market
It will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that doesn't have
registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for
most phone companies

You see with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any
cellular company or other phones or ports because they will follow
the standard  ATT has already announced a clipper chip encryption
product  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to
use these chips   If they get enough market share they will rule

And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be
tapped by the police  The public isn't that concerned about it now
after all  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen
to today  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure
them only from the police

Well some people will buy these phones but they will only work with
other proprietary phones so the market will be small and the phones
expensive  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them
cheap only the Mob will buy them

And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of
better encryption phones because the only reason a person would want
one is to evade the police

 The old cheesebox was the preCarterphone version of the call
 diverter  After the Carterphone decision there were several vendors
 that sold call diverters  I've got a couple in my basement that
 were used to redirect my office phone to my home number when I
 didn't feel like going into the office
 
 It'd be quite easy to generate an anonymous redialer version of the

About  months ago I heard a report on NPR about a number
STOPPER or some such for placing untraceable calls
You call them and on bong tone dial the number you want to
call they told the NPR interviewer that nothing short of a
court order which they'd fight would make them release their
records

I'm quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal 
assault on emerging American freedoms  The Clinton administration 
nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever 
in regulating cryptography To do so is tantamount to regulating 
acceptable' speech and is blatantly unconstitutional Perhaps we 
should rename this year ' in honor of such an illustrious 
proposal  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy and the adminstration
receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure

I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology
to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures  The US
government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any
serious threat to my liberties such as this and I call on everyone
with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this 
proposal  The administration does not seem to understand that they
are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the
public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is 
wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty

While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

It seems to me that US Diplomatic communications should be 
tappable by the UN whenever any countries produce a warrant to
the UN  In fact I think we should stop paying the NSA billions
of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason
These actions violate the sovereignity of international law I hope
Mr Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here
But if he isn't it's a modest and reasonable proposal so he should
find merit with it nevertheless

Cryptography is neutral technology If everybody has strong 
cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen 
housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable 
equilibrium  Anything less is an unworkable antiegaltarian 
arrangement intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms and
guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent 
impracticality We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans

For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be 
increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality 
and protecting Americans

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law

It is not possible for the Federal Government
to act quickly'' or develop consistent comprehensive
policies'' PERIOD  And even if by some grandiose miracle such
a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to
deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights

The administration has to be committed to leaving private 
industries alone esp on this issue  The government has no 
legitimate role in regulating the content of communications
Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their
surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be 
disarmed of it 

Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

No such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent
to a veiled threat which I don't appreciate  This kind of 
extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism I will
trade threats for threats and violation for violation

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done

If the administration did say this it would find itself 
impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential
established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy 
guarantees The administration would have no legal standing 
whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and
criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast 
segments of the population

     nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product 

The US comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically 
committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an 
increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that  
Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses
We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please 
and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit 
pattern over our data highways we please And if you try to stop 
us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness

privacy vs law enforcement
     There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition 

This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie  The two aims of
privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally 
incompatible and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise 
Americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology 
to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly 
been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and 
unrepresentative government

Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties not the subject
in this post the name Clipper Chip seems very confusable with the
Clipper chip of Intergraph

Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor Clipper was
a bit RISC microprocessor It is still used in some workstations
notably those from Intergraph the supplier of CAD tools Intergraph
acquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National
Semiconductor several years back

When I first saw Clipper Chip in the announcement I immediately
thought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know

This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue but then I'm not a
lawyer I'd say I'm a cryptologist but I don't want to incriminate
myself under the laws of the new regime

  Cocacola is made under licence in dozens of countries around the

 In all those countries Cocacola is distributed in a form of
 concentrate what the local producers simply mix with water and other
 simple ingredients The trick is to know what is in the concentrate
 

I don't know if this is still true but at one time CocaCola
took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret  For instance
several plants in different cities each made one of six partial
concentrates which were then shipped backand forth and remixed
in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole
formula  By now I would guess that PepsiCo's chemists would have
reverseengineered it can't be all that exotic  Actually I
prefer Pepsi anyhow in about  minutes I'm gonna put money

The Clipper Chip will have no effect  Current generation PCs portable
and desktop all have analog voice  digital voice and vice versa
capabilities  So I only need a modem output to the telephone
and I can interpose any encryption screen on my voice traffic I want

Not even a big deal but it will pass muster if the have a way
of checking whether I am using their Clipper Chip encryption without
a full decoding

I have been chided for stating that Dorthy Denning was intellectually
dishonest in the ACM debate and in this newsgroup  I have previously
refrained from suggesting that she is arguing on behalf of consulting
clients

Now I say that it is clear that Dorthy Denning has been functioning
as a lobbyist not a computer scientist  She has used legal ethics
truth is what you can convince anyone of not scientific ethics
truth is understanding the external world

Maybe we can revoke her ACM membership

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic ie In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank

	I was thinking about this also It's quite possible the
system transmits in clear the serial number of the device being
used That way they can start a tap get the serial number and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key

	If they tap someone who's apparently using encryption but
don't find that prefix then they'll assume it's an unauthorized
encryption scheme

	This doesn't handle superencrypted traffic If the clipper
doesn't impose any unfortunate performance sideeffects there's no
reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of tripleDES encrypted
traffic That way your traffic looks normal and perhaps anyone
desiring to listen in won't even bother since they know nobody's
going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for
important stuff

FACT  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license
to do so from PKP whether or not one is charging for it  Furthermore
any use of RSA other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law is similarly unlawful  Therefore the average citizen cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP

WRONG  I don't think even PKP claims this one  It is not unlawful to
distribute code implementing RSA  It appears to be unlawful to use it so
I agree with your last sentence

FACT  There are no restrictions yet on the use of cryptography under
US law although this is beginning to look like it will change  The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's
patents

Yes that's correct

The key question is whether nonClipper encryption will be made illegal

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans
have the right to Clipper encryption but not to unbreakable encryption
This implies that ultimately nonClipper strong encryption must become
illegal

Text deleted no value judgement implied

It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here

Hal Finney
halalumnicaltechedu

More than shocking  What this says to me is no less than that government
is very interested in monitoring the public  This does more than scare me
it mortifies me

PGP and RIPEM must become widespread enough to resist what Mr Finney has
IMHO correctly identified as the next logical step  What was once an
academic discussion with regard to concealing cyphertext has now become
a real consideration

The rhetoric that the clinton administration seems obsessed with harmony
either or propositions tension tells me that they know how difficult
it will be to sell this proposition

The phrase I hear more and more is I can't believe this is actually happening
here  Call me conserative Clinton was a huge mistake that we'll all be
paying for tommorow and many years from now

Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one  They are
pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they
get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market
It will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that doesn't have
registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for
most phone companies

If Brad's analysis is correct it may offer an explanation for why the
encryption algorithm is being kept secret  This will prevent competitors
from coming out with Clippercompatible phones which lack the government
installed back door  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long
as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government
chips

It would be nice from the point of view of personal privacy if Brad
turns out to be right  As long as people still have the power to provide
their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper privacy
is still possible  But the wording of several passages in the announcement
makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true

Okay let's suppose that the NSANISTMykotronix Registered
Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system
from my local radio shack Every phone comes with a built in
chip and the government has the key to every phone call 
I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key 

What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or 
buying a used phone at a garage sale Whooa The secret registered
keys just became unsynchronized When the government comes 

It's very possible even likely that the serial number of the
invididual chip is broadcast either in a standard encrypted 
format so that all the big brother types need to do is listen to
the traffic get  a court order generally just by saying that they
think you may be a crook and go to it
r
to listen in they only receive gobbledlygook because the 
secret key registered under my name isn't the right one 

That leads me to conjecture that

 The system isn't that secure There are just two master keys
that work for all the phones in the country The part about
registering your keys is just bogus 

or 

 The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks
like this Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to
town

In either case I think we need to look at this a bit deeper'jblmWwxlD

My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret 

   The chip is regretably likely to become a standard   There will
   be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this
   chip like it or not

   If the alrogithm is public and the code is as secure absent the 
   access to escrowed keys as represented an enterprising sort 
   would make compatible crypto chips for which no key had been
   escrowed  This is likely what the release was refering to when 
   they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the
   security of the escrow system

The actual algorithm is classified however their main thrust here is
for cellular phones and encryption is only over the radio end not
end to end I think   End to end will come later

And of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company and
since the phone company complies with court orders they will know the
magic number of your chip when they sign out a warrant on you and
then can present the warrant to the key escrow house

Let's assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent

the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And I'm not entirely joking about
those two names

In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this

with an old TV can hear them  for most people this will be viewed
as an oh goody step upwards

And look at how tolerant the public is  They're willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now

It was suggested by one person that a lot of nonevidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants because anybody can do it and it's
just an ECPA violation  This would stop that  All tapping would need
a warrant or a breach of security at the escrow houses

It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow
houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure

It's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are
good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses


What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you
at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that
a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your
cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
escrow houses

Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
laid   In many ways it would be a positive step if they had to
Judges set time limits on warrants I assume  At the end of the time
limit they should have to renew or replace your chip


That's if we go with this scheme which I am not sure I agree with

Hey it's better than the status quo

I am far less worried about the feds tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls

It would be stupid to rely on even a Clipperized channel for truly 
sensitive material but it does seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
guard against casual eavesdropping  For example even with my strong right 
to bear arms view of the private right to possess and use strong 
cryptosystems the system as described provides enough security that I would 
actually buy a cordless phone and would be much less wary of using cellular 
phones walkietalkies and so on  As long as it's only used for massmarket 
voice scrambling I actually don't see a problem with it

If you want more security than it offers use something different  Use PKCS 
for electronic mail CELP over DES or triple DES with DiffieHellman key 
exchange for your voice traffic or whatever

And yes I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted but this is at 
least an incrememental improvement for certain applications

 In mathematical terms what is a privatekey cryptosystem

  A privatekey cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a
  decryption system D The encryption system E is a collection of
  functions EK indexed by keys'' K mapping some set of
  plaintexts'' P to some set of ciphertexts'' C Similarly the
  decryption system D is a collection of functions DK such that
  DKEKP  P for every plaintext P  That is succesful decryption
  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key
  index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext
  into ciphertext  Such systems wherein the same key value is used to
  encrypt and decrypt are also known as symmetric'' cryptoystems

 What is an attack

  In intuitive terms a passive attack on a cryptosystem is any method
  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their
  corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out
  more information about the plaintexts It's possible to state
  mathematically what this means Here we go

  Fix functions F G and H of n variables Fix an encryption system E
  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys

  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an
  algorithm A with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that
  there is probability p of computing h  HPPn if we have
  f  FPPn and g  GEKPEKPn Note that this
  probability depends on the distribution of the vector KPPn

  The attack is trivial or pointless'' if there is probability at
  least p of computing h  HPPn if f  FPPn and
  g  GCCn Here CCn range uniformly over the possible
  ciphertexts and have no particular relation to PPn In other
  words an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions
  EKPEKPn

  An attack is called oneciphertext'' if n   twociphertext'' if
  n   and so on

 What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically

  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure
  Read part  we keep saying a strong cryptosystem must have this
  property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem
  is strong''

  In contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely
  formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is
  strong We say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against
  all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as
  defined above is too slow to be practical If we can prove this
  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist
  any passive cryptanalytic technique If we can reduce this statement
  to some wellknown unsolved problem then we still have confidence that
  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break

  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical
  definition Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions
  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results We can
  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used
  properly it just means that the assumptions are valid

  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too The cryptanalyst
  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions Often he can try to
  construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails
  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis
  
 Why is the onetime pad secure

  By definition the onetime pad is a cryptosystem where the
  plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings
  of some length m and EKP is just the sum let's say the exclusive
  or of K and P

  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are no nontrivial
  singleciphertext attacks on the onetime pad assuming a uniform
  distribution of keys Note that we don't have to assume a uniform
  distribution of plaintexts Here's the proof Let A be an attack
  ie an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h
  with some probability p that h  HP whenever f  FP and
  g  GEKP ie g  GK  P Then because the distribution of
  K is uniform and independent of P the distribution of K  P must also
  be uniform and independent of P But also the distribution of C is
  uniform and independent of P Hence there is probability exactly p
  that h  HP whenever f  FP and g  GC over all P and C Thus
  a fortiori A is trivial

  On the other hand the onetime pad is not secure if a key K is used
  for more than one plaintext ie there are nontrivial
  multipleciphertext attacks So to be properly used a key K must be
  thrown away after one encryption The key is also called a pad''
  this explains the name onetime pad''

 What's a ciphertextonly attack

  In the notation above a ciphertextonly attack is one where F is
  constant Given only some information GEKPEKPn about
  n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some
  information HPPn about the plaintexts The attack is trivial
  if it has just as good a chance of producing HPPn when given
  GCCn for random CCn

  For example say GC  C and say HP is the first bit of P We can
  easily write down an attackthe guessing attack'' which simply
  guesses that HP is  This attack is trivial because it doesn't use
  the ciphertext it has a fiftyfifty chance of guessing correctly no
  matter what On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which
  produces one bit of information about P with  success using C
  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to  So this is
  a nontrivial attack

 What's a knownplaintext attack

  The classic knownplaintext attack has FPP  P
  GCC  CC and HPP depending only on P
  In other words given two ciphertexts C and C and one decryption
  P the knownplaintext attack should produce information about the
  other decryption P

  Note that knownplaintext attacks are often defined in the literature
  as producing information about the key but this is pointless the
  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him
  decrypt further messages

 What's a chosenplaintext attack

  A chosenplaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical
  series of active attacks on a cryptosystem attacks where the
  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor These attacks don't fit into
  our model of passive attacks explained above Anyway a
  chosenplaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and
  look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured
  out how to decrypt any message More absurd examples of this sort of
  attack are the chosenkey attack'' and chosensystem attack''

  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption
  attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a
  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext

  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks
  for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext P as
  TEKhTRPRP where T is a timekey sequence number chosen anew
  for each message R is a random number and h is a oneway hash
  function Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusiveor

 In mathematical terms what can you say about bruteforce attacks

  Consider the following knownplaintext attack We are given some
  plaintexts PPn and ciphertexts CCn We're
  also given a ciphertext Cn We run through every key K When we find
  K such that EKPi  Ci for every i  n we print DKCn

  If n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed
  on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results
  only once in a blue moon for random inputs Thus this is a nontrivial
  attack Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many
  possible keys

 What's a keyguessing attack What's entropy

  Say somebody is using the onetime padbut isn't choosing keys
  randomly and uniformly from all mbit messages as he was supposed to
  for our security proof In fact say he's known to prefer keys which
  are English words Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English
  words as possible keys This attack will often succeed and it's much
  faster than a bruteforce search of the entire keyspace

  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its
  entropy This number E is the number of real bits of information''
  of the key a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within
  E guesses E is defined as the sum of pK log pK where pK is
  the probability of key K

 How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect

  WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break
  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams a typed password
  and a bytewide counter initialized to the password length Full
  descriptions are given in Bennett BEN and Bergen and Caelli
  BER

  Chris Galas writes Someone awhile back was looking for a way to
  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution 
  There is a software company named Accessdata  East  South
  Orem UT   that has a software package that will
  decrypt any WordPerfect Lotus  QuatroPro MS Excel and Paradox
  files The cost of the package is  Steep prices but if you
  think your pw key is less than  characters or  char give them a
  call and ask for the free demo disk The demo disk will decrypt files
  that have a  char or less pw key''

 How do I break a Vigenere repeatedkey cipher

  A repeatedkey cipher where the ciphertext is something like the
  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY and so on is called a Vigenere cipher
  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English do the
  following 

   Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences
  See Gaines GAI Sinkov SIN Trying each displacement of
  the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal 
  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something
  over  of the bytes will be equal If they have used different
  key then less than  will be equal assuming random bit bytes
  of key covering normal ASCII text The smallest displacement which
  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key

   Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself This
  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself Since
  English has about  bit of real information per byte  streams of
  text XORed together has  bits of info per bit byte providing
  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption And in fact
  one stream of text XORed with itself has just  bit per byte

  If the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a
  standard polyalphabetic substitution All the old cryptanalysis
  texts show how to break those It's possible with those methods in
  the hands of an expert if there's only ten times as much text as key
  See for example Gaines GAI Sinkov SIN

 How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX PGP RIPEM PEM 

  Here's one popular method using the des command

    cat file  compress  des privatekey  uuencode  mail

  Meanwhile there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called
  PEM Privacy Enhanced Mail It is described in RFCs  through
   To join the PEM mailing list contact pemdevrequesttiscom
  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this
  writing

  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting
  mail PGP and RIPEM  Both are available by FTP  Each has its own
  newsgroup altsecuritypgp and altsecurityripem  Each has its own FAQ
  as well

  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm
  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only or at least primarily
  in the USA

  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which
  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside
  the USA

  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of
  the message PGP used IDEA RIPEM uses DES and RSA for encrypting the
  message key they should be able to interoperate freely  Although there
  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and
  algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as
  we know

 Is the UNIX crypt command secure

  No See REE There is a program available called cbw crypt
  breaker's workbench which can be used to do ciphertextonly attacks
  on files encrypted with crypt One source for CBW is FTPCB

 How do I use compression with encryption

  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by
  some simple encryption method eg XOR with a repeated key

  Unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact
  distribution of possible inputs For all practical purposes it's
  impossible to describe the typical English text'' beyond coarse
  characteristics such as singleletter frequencies You can build up
  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy
  has a slightly more accurate model he'll be able to find some
  redundancy in your compressed output

  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they
  have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that
  actually starts off with high redundancy For example the output of
  UNIX compress begins with a wellknown threebyte magic number''
  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis
  
  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a
  bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means
  removes the need for strong encryption

  Compression after encryption is silly

 Is there an unbreakable cipher

  Yes The onetime pad is unbreakable see part  Unfortunately the
  onetime pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as
  plaintext

  Of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be
  useful Rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by
  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is
  expected to remain valid

 What does random'' mean in cryptography

  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom
  number generator than most applications For a source of bits to be
  cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to
  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of
  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of
  th through Nst bits for all N up to the lifetime of the source

  A software generator also known as pseudorandom has the function
  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently
  random bits  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by
  the opponent  Ideally it should also be truly random perhaps
  generated by a hardware random number source

  Those who have Sparcstation  workstations could for example
  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of
  entropy by not connecting anything to it  For example

	cat devaudio  compress  foo

  gives a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in
  it  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key
  for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudorandom
  string

  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is
  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that
  because it looks complicated to a human it must be random  For
  example disk operation completion times sound like they might be
  unpredictable to many people but a spinning disk is much like a
  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy

 What is the unicity point aka unicity distance

  See SHA The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount
  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in
  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number
  of ciphertext bits used Ciphertexts significantly longer than this
  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment This is used to
  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertextonly cryptanalysis 
  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have
  multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security
  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one

  Unicity distance like all statistical or informationtheoretic
  measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives
  probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext
  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible
  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys
  are tried for the decryption Working cryptologists don't normally
  deal with unicity distance as such Instead they directly determine
  the likelihood of events of interest

  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters If fewer than
  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not
  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of
  possible keys DES has a unicity distance of  characters
  which is less than  ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to
   ASCII characters This may seem alarmingly low at first but
  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work
  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been
  intercepted

  In fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used
  in discussing unicity distance Like other measures such as key
  size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if
  it's too small but doesn't guarantee security if it's high Few
  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all
  manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges'' to crack
  some cipher messages However similar informationtheoretic
  considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a
  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem
  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and
  informationtheoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most
  promising directions

  Unfortunately most literature on the application of information
  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal
   work of Alan Turing see KOZ For some insight into the
  possibilities see KUL and GOO

 What is key management and why is it important

  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in
  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system
  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption Of
  course one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling
  Mossad about its cryptosystems but Mossad probably finds out anyway
  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can
  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress Thus especially in
  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are
  transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but
  also enough key material to cover the traffic

  Key management refers to the distribution authentication and
  handling of keys

  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology
  is the STU III secure telephone unit which for classified use
  employs individual coded Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key
  Management Center operated by NSA There is a hierarchy in that
  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control
  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and
  to perform installationmaintenance functions such as the
  reporting of lost CIKs

  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management
  problem For publickey systems there are several related issues
  many having to do with whom do you trust''

 Can I use pseudorandom or chaotic numbers as a key stream

  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from
  relatively compact generators Perhaps the simplest example is a
  linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random
  number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds
  and outputs Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a
  high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice Mathematically
  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for
  cryptanalysts to exploit More complicated generators have more
  complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures
  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable
  structure at all

  See KNU exercise  REE and BOY

 What is the correct frequency list for English letters

  There are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than
  the one before You can find the first answer in various books
  namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of
  English text Of course any such list will be correctly'' computed
  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken

  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense What do
  you mean by English letters'' The English language'' is not a
  fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized It
  has changed over time it is different between different authors
  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of
  the language as a whole

  The third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have
  exactly the same characteristics as English in general but for all
  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter
  In fact there's an entire field called Bayesian statistics'' other
  buzzwords are maximum entropy methods'' and maximum likelihood
  estimation'' which studies questions like What's the chance that a
  text with these letter frequencies is in English'' and comes up with
  reasonably robust answers

  So make your own list from your own samples of English text It will
  be good enough for practical work if you use it properly

 What is the Enigma

  For a project in data security we are looking for sources of
  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by
  the British during WWII''

  See WEL DEA KOZ HOD KAH

 How do I shuffle cards

  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of
  values using a random or pseudorandom function  All possible output
  permutations of this process should be equally likely  To do this you
  need a random function modranx which will produce a uniformly
  distributed random integer in the interval x  Given that
  function you can shuffle with the following C code assuming ARRLTH
  is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two
  addresses given

  for  n  ARRLTH n    n  swap arrmodran n  arrn  

  modranx can not be achieved exactly with a simple ranno  x since
  ranno's interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the
  error will be very small  To cover this case one can take ranno's
  modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno returns a value less
  than y go back and get another ranno value


 Can I foil SW pirates by encrypting my CDROM

  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CDROM with
  possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted
  separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps
  even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy

  As far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard
  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the
  keyboard  If there were such an identification then the CDROM could be
  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in
  part on the unique identifier  However in this case the CDROM is one
  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose

  If the CDROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must
  be a key or set of keys for that encryption produced at some stage in
  the process  That key is useable with any copy of the CDROM's data
  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the
  illegal copy

 What is the coding system used by VCR

 What is cryptology Cryptography Plaintext Ciphertext Encryption Key

  The story begins When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted
  acquaintances he didn't trust the messengers So he replaced every A
  by a C every B by a D and so on through the alphabet Only someone
  who knew the shift by '' rule could decipher his messages

  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
  that only certain people can see through the disguise Cryptography is
  the art of creating and using cryptosystems Cryptanalysis is the art
  of breaking cryptosystemsseeing through the disguise even when
  you're not supposed to be able to Cryptology is the study of both
  cryptography and cryptanalysis

  The original message is called a plaintext The disguised message is
  called a ciphertext Encryption means any procedure to convert
  plaintext into ciphertext Decryption means any procedure to convert
  ciphertext into plaintext

  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms The
  algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys For instance
  Caesar probably used shift by n'' encryption for several different
  values of n It's natural to say that n is the key here

  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are
  called recipients Other people are enemies opponents interlopers
  eavesdroppers or third parties

 What references can I start with to learn cryptology

  For an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given
  in part  are the best place to begin as they are in general
  concise authored by competent people and well written However
  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has
  developed in the last  years or so and are more abstract and
  mathematical than historical The Codebreakers by Kahn KAH is
  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
  to the mid's

  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines GAI or
  Sinkov SIN This is recommended especially for people who want
  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common
  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one

  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of
  many public researchers to problems in cryptology Consequently
  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared The
  book of Denning DEN gives a good introduction to a broad range
  of security including encryption algorithms database security
  access control and formal models of security Similar comments
  apply to the books of Price  Davies PRI and Pfleeger PFL

  The books of Konheim KON and Meyer  Matyas MEY are quite
  technical books Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in
  the development of DES and both books give a thorough analysis of
  DES Konheim's book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses
  of many classical cryptosystems Meyer and Matyas concentrate on
  modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management
  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and
  networks

  The books of Rueppel RUE and Koblitz KOB concentrate on
  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography

 How does one go about cryptanalysis

  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of
  analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern
  finding patience determination and luck The best available
  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series
  FRIE It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for
  the most part gained through the attempted solution of given
  systems Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the
  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still
  classified

  Modern publickey cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer
  or taking a discrete logarithm These are not the traditional fare
  of the cryptanalyst Computational number theorists are some of the
  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems

 What is a bruteforce search and what is its cryptographic relevance

  In a nutshell If fx  y and you know y and can compute f you can
  find x by trying every possible x That's bruteforce search

  Example Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding
  ciphertext but doesn't know the key He can simply try encrypting the
  plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matchesor
  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster
  Every welldesigned cryptosystem has such a large key space that this
  bruteforce search is impractical
    
  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
  practical For example DES which has been in use for over  years
  now has  or about  possible keys A computation with
  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the
  mid's The situation is very different today given the dramatic
  decrease in cost per processor operation Massively parallel
  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search
  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge GAR

  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a
  bruteforce search of some manageably small space of possibilities

 What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem

  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret

  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above  The
  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of
  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and
  if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount
  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is
  probably strong

  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears
  random to all standard statistical tests see for example CAE
    
  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks A
  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect

  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily
  strong Certainly not Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first
  However sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is
  strong by mathematical proof If Joe can break this system then
  he can also solve the wellknown difficult problem of factoring
  integers'' See part   Failing that it's a crap shoot

 If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it
  guaranteed analysisproof in practice

  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical
  cryptanalysis'' the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your
  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext For instance he might
  assume cribs''stretches of probable plaintext If the crib is
  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the
  rest of the message Or he might exploit isologs''the same
  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys Thus
  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
  doesn't have a chance

  Sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused The onetime pad
  for example loses all security if it is used more than once Even
  chosenplaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into
  the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed See
  KAH
  
 Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are
  relatively easy to break

  Some don't know any better Often amateurs think they can design
  secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst
  could do And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody
  to invest the work needed to crack a system

Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
one Make it voluntary

That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

 It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow
 houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure
 
 It's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are
 good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses
 
 
 What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you
 at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that
 a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your
 cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
 escrow houses

Getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable
all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver
as I understand the proposal I could be wrong but I've seen no
mention of session keys being the escrowed entities

As the EFF noted this raises further issues about the fruits of one
bust leading to incrimination in other areas

But is it any worse than the current unsecure system It becomes much
worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main
concern of most of us I think The camel's nose in the tent etc

And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is
increased thus allowing greater access to central office records by
the government the conversations being encrypted who will object to
letting the government have access to them perhaps even automatically
archiving large fractions This was one of the main objections to
the S proposal that it would force telecom suppliers to provide
easy access for the government

One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted
conversations now all it takes is one misstep one violation that
gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt all of them

Do we want anyone to have this kind of power

 What groups are around What's a FAQ Who am I Why am I here

  Read newsannouncenewusers and newsanswers for a few weeks Always
  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it
  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same
  newsgroup After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the
  readers want to see

 Do political discussions belong in scicrypt

  No In fact some newsgroups notably misclegalcomputing were
  created exactly so that political questions like Should RSA be
  patented'' don't get in the way of technical discussions Many
  scicrypt readers also read misclegalcomputing comporgefftalk
  comppatents scimath compcompression et al for the benefit of
  people who don't care about those other topics try to put your
  postings in the right group

  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other noncryptographic
  spy stuff'' don't belong in scicrypt either

 How do I present a new encryption scheme in scicrypt

  I just came up with this neat method of encryption Here's some
  ciphertext FHDSIJOYWOGBUJHKFSYUIRE Is it strong'' Without a
  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on scicrypt

  If you have come up with an encryption scheme providing some
  ciphertext from it is not adequate Nobody has ever been impressed by
  random gibberish Any new algorithm should be secure even if the
  opponent knows the full algorithm including how any message key is
  distributed and only the private key is kept secret There are some
  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts
  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm but
  this is a timeconsuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most
  scicrypt readers won't bother with

  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme First of all
  find out if it's really new Look through this FAQ for references and
  related methods Familiarize yourself with the literature and the
  introductory textbooks

  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at
  large try to break it yourself You shouldn't waste the time of tens
  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily
  answered on your own

  If you really think your system is secure and you want to get some
  reassurance from experts you might try posting full details of your
  system including working code and a solid theoretical explanation to
  scicrypt Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated
  in some areas

  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted
  You can encourage this by offering cash rewardsfor instance noted
  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering  to anyone who can break
  Snefrubut there are no guarantees If you don't have enough
  experience then most likely any experts who look at your system will
  be able to find a flaw If this happens it's your responsibility to
  consider the flaw and learn from it rather than just add one more
  layer of complication and come back for another round

  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA
  look at it A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope
  of this FAQ

  Among professionals a common rule of thumb is that if you want to
  design a cryptosystem you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst

 What is a product cipher

  A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak
  operations such as substitution transposition modular
  additionmultiplication and linear transformation A block
  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data bytes
  sayall at once then goes on to the next block The notion of
  product ciphers is due to Shannon SHA Examples of modern
  product ciphers include LUCIFER SOR DES NBS SPnetworks
  KAM LOKI BRO FEAL SHI PES LAI Khufu and Khafre
  MEa The socalled Feistel ciphers are a class of product
  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round
  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round LUCIFER
  DES LOKI and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers

  The following table compares the main parameters of several product 
  ciphers

  cipher      block length      key bits      number of rounds
  LUCIFER                                         
  DES                                               
  LOKI                                              
  FEAL                                         x x  
  PES                                               

 What makes a product cipher secure

  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is
  completely secure So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the
  cipher looks highly random'' For example the cipher must be
  nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends
  on every bit of the plaintext and the key Meyer MEY has shown
  that at least  rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a
  dependence In this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing''
  function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a
  complex nonlinear fashion

  The fixed perround substitutions of the product cipher are
  referred to as Sboxes For example LUCIFER has  Sboxes and DES
  has  Sboxes The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a
  careful design of these Sboxes A list of partial design criteria
  for the Sboxes of DES which apply to Sboxes in general may be
  found in Brown BRO and Brickell et al BRI

 What are some grouptheoretic properties of product ciphers

  Let E be a product cipher that maps Nbit blocks to Nbit blocks
  Let EKX be the encryption of X under key K Then for any fixed K
  the map sending X to EKX is a permutation of the set of Nbit
  blocks Denote this permutation by PK The set of all Nbit
  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written SN
  The collection of all these permutations PK where K ranges over all
  possible keys is denoted ESN If E were a random mapping from
  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect ESN to generate
  a large subset of SN

  Coppersmith and Grossman COP have shown that a very simple
  product cipher can generate the alternating group AN given a
  sufficient number of rounds The alternating group is half of the
  symmetric group it consists of all even'' permutations ie all
  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps
  Even and Goldreich EVE were able to extend these results to show
  that Feistel ciphers can generate AN given a sufficient number
  of rounds

  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the
  grouptheoretic properties of a cipher Multiple encipherment is an
  extension over single encipherment if for keys K K there does
  not exist a third key K such that

  EKEKX  EKX                

  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys
  K K is equal to a single encryption under the third key K  If
  for every K K there exists a K such that eq  is true then
  we say that E is a group

  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was
  extensively studied by Sherman Kaliski and Rivest SHE In their
  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a
  group In fact DES is not a group CAM

 What can be proven about the security of a product cipher

  Recall from above that PK is a permutation produced by E under
  some key K The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that PK
  appears to be a random element of SN the symmetric group
  Let R be an element of SN selected randomly We will say that PK
  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given PK and R in some
  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial
  time That is with time bounded resources the observer cannot
  determine which of the permutations is produced by E the optimal
  decision is no better than simply guessing

  Luby and Rackoff LUB have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers
  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by
  random boolean functions

 How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size

  There are four standard modes of operation and numerous nonstandard
  ones as well  The standard modes of operation are defined in the US
  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS 
  published in   See the question about ECB below for more details

  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher the modes of
  operation can be used with any block cipher

 Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication

  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself
  that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself 
  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation  But one
  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and 
  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages
  that were authenticated using that key
  
  See ANSI X and FIPS   for a standard method of message
  authentication using DES

 What exactly is DES

  DES is the US Government's Data Encryption Standard  a product 
  cipher that operates on bit blocks of data using a bit key  

  It is defined in FIPS   which supersedes FIPS  
  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS
  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm DEA
  defined in ANSI X 

 What is triple DES

  Triple DES is a product cipher which like DES operates on bit 
  data blocks  There are several forms each of which uses the DES
  cipher  times  Some forms use two bit keys some use three
  The DES modes of operation may also be used with tripleDES

  Some people refer to EKDKEKx as tripleDES

  This method is defined in chapter  of the ANSI standard X
  Financial Institution Key Management and is intended for use in
  encrypting DES keys and IVs for Automated Key Distribution  Its
  formal name is Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key
  Pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE

  That standard says section  Key encrypting keys may be a single
  DEA key or a DEA key pair  Key pairs shoud be used where additional
  security is needed eg the data protected by the keys has a long
  security life  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
  single key

  Others use the term tripleDES for EKDKEKx or
  EKEKEKx

  One of us Carl Ellison keeps advocating DES triple use in the form
  EK TRAN EK TRAN EK COMPRESS x  where each DES instance
  has its own key and IV for CBC mode and TRAN has been posted on
  scicrypt  It is a largeblock transposition program taking its key
  from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on
  its own part

 What is differential cryptanalysis

  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be
  applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on
  a repeated round function The method was recently popularized by
  Biham and Shamir BIH but Coppersmith has remarked that the
  Sboxes of DES were optimized against this attack some  years ago
  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers
  notably FEAL BIa

  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of
  ciphertexts Y Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X X' satisfy a
  known difference D  XX' where  is componentwise XOR In the
  basic BihamShamir attack  such plaintext pairs are required
  to determine the key for DES Substantially fewer pairs are required
  if DES is truncated to  or  rounds In these cases the actual key
  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs
  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many
  known plaintexts

  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling
  observations on the algorithm Most importantly if the key
  schedule was removed from DES and a   bit key was used
  the key could be recovered in less than  steps Thus
  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES
  Further the Sboxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that
  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant
  improvement in the differential attack

  Adi Shamir is quoted to say NYTimes Oct   I would say
  that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence
  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened''

 How was NSA involved in the design of DES

  According to Kinnucan KIN Tuchman a member of the group that
  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying We developed the DES
  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers The NSA did not
  dictate a single wire'' Tuchman and Meyer another developer of
  DES spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in
  Lucifer They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer Their
  basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation
  and key scheduling functions  IBM has classified the notes
  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA
  The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep
  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms' explains Tuchman''
  
  On the other hand a document called Involvement of the NSA in
  the development of DES unclassified summary of the United States
  Select Committee on Intelligence'' printed in the IEEE
  Communications Magazine p  states In the development
  of DES NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient
  indirectly assisted in the development of the Sbox structures and
  certified that the final DES algorithm was to the best of their
  knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness''

  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA
  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the
  algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense
  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman
  presented above

 Is DES available in software

  Several people have made DES code available via ftp see part  for
  pathnames Stig Ostholm FTPSO BSD FTPBK Eric Young FTPEY
  Dennis Furguson FTPDF Mark Riordan FTPMR Phil Karn FTPPK
  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson PAT

  FIPS  says The algorithm specified in this standard is to be
  implemented  using hardware not software technology  
  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in
  compliance with this standard  Despite this software
  implementations abound and are used by government agencies

 Is DES available in hardware

  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors
  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products

  Chip Rosenthal says Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES
  encryptiondecryption device for use on standard digital Kbps PCM
  telecom data streams It is capable of processing data in real time
  eg one sampleframe It is the DS Their phone number is
   You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom

 Can DES be used to protect classified information

  DES is not intended to protect classified data  FIPS  says
  This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for
  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following
  conditions apply     cryptographic protection is required and
   the data is not classified according to the National Security Act
  of  as amended or the Atomic Energy Act of  as amended

 What are ECB CBC CFB and OFB encryption

  These are methods for using block ciphers such as DES to encrypt 
  messages files and blocks of data known as modes of operation
  Four modes of operation are defined in FIPS   December  
  and also in ANSI X   

  FIPS  specifies that when bit ASCII data is sent in octets the
  unused mostsignificant bit is to be set to 
  FIPS  also specifies the padding for short blocks

  The four DES modes of operation are 
	Electronic Code Book  ECB 
	Cipher Block Chaining CBC 
	Kbit Cipher FeedBack CFB and 
	Kbit Output FeedBack OFB

  These methods are explained below in a clanguagelike notation

  Some symbols

  Pn	The n'th block of plaintext input to encryption output from
  	decryption  Size of block determined by the mode

  Cn	The n'th block of ciphertext output from encryption input to
  	decryption  Size of block determined by the mode

  Em	The DES encryption function performed on bit block m using
  	the key schedule derived from some bit key

  Dm	The DES decryption function performed on bit block m using
  	the same key schedule as in Em except that the  keys
  	in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in Em

  IV	A bit initialization vector a secret value which along with
  	the key is shared by both encryptor and decryptor

  In	The n'th value of a bit variable used in some modes
  Rn	The n'th value of a bit variable used in some modes

  LSBmk The k least significant rightmost bits of m

  	  I  IV			I  IV
  n	  In  Cn			In  Cn	
  all n Rn  EIn		Rn  EIn
  all n Cn  PnRn		Pn  CnRn

  CFB notes Since In depends only on the plain or cipher text from the
  previous operation the E function can be performed in parallel with
  the reception of the text with which it is used


  kbit Output FeedBack OFB

  	  Pn and Cn are each k bits long   k    

  	  Encryption			Decryption
  	  I  IV			I  IV
  n	  In  Ink  Rn	In  Ink  Rn

  	  I  IV			I  IV
  n	  In  Rn			In  Rn	
  all n Rn  EIn		Rn  EIn
  all n Cn  PnRn		Pn  CnRn

  OFB notes encryption and decryption are identical  Since In is
  independent of P and C the E function can be performed in advance of
  the receipt of the plaincipher text with which it is to be used


  Additional notes on DES modes of operation

  ECB and CBC use E to encrypt and D to decrypt but the feedback modes
  use E to both encrypt and decrypt  This disproves the erroneous claim
  that systems which feature E but not D cannot be used for data
  confidentiality and therefore are not subject to export controls

 What is publickey cryptography

  In a classic cryptosystem we have encryption functions EK and
  decryption functions DK such that DKEKP  P for any plaintext
  P In a publickey cryptosystem EK can be easily computed from some
  public key'' X which in turn is computed from K X is published so
  that anyone can encrypt messages If DK cannot be easily computed
  from X then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages
  That's the essence of publickey cryptography published by Diffie
  and Hellman in 

  In a classic cryptosystem if you want your friends to be able to
  send secret messages to you you have to make sure nobody other than
  them sees the key K In a publickey cryptosystem you just publish X
  and you don't have to worry about spies

  This is only the beginning of publickey cryptography There is an
  extensive literature on security models for publickey cryptography
  applications of publickey cryptography other applications of the
  mathematical technology behind publickey cryptography and so on

 What's RSA

  RSA is a publickey cryptosystem defined by Rivest Shamir and
  Adleman  For full details there is a FAQ available by ftp at
  RSACOM Here's a small example

  Plaintexts are positive integers up to  Keys are quadruples
  pqed with p a bit prime number q a bit prime number
  and d and e large numbers with de   divisible by pq We
  define EKP  Pe mod pq DKC  Cd mod pq

  Now EK is easily computed from the pair pqebut as far as
  anyone knows there is no easy way to compute DK from the pair
  pqe So whoever generates K can publish pqe Anyone can send a
  secret message to him he is the only one who can read the messages

 Is RSA secure

  Nobody knows An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q
  See below for comments on how fast stateoftheart factorization
  algorithms run Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to
  prove that factorizationor any realistic problem at all for that
  matteris inherently slow It is easy to formalize what we mean by
  RSA isisn't strong'' but as Hendrik W Lenstra Jr says
  Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to
  prove that algorithms with certain properties do not exist and
  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative
  results''

 How fast can people factor numbers

  It depends on the size of the numbers In October  Arjen Lenstra
  and Dan Bernstein factored    into primes using about three
  weeks of MasPar time The MasPar is a processor SIMD machine
  each processor can add about  integers per second The
  algorithm there is called the number field sieve'' it is quite a
  bit faster for special numbers like    than for general numbers
  n but it takes time only about expOlog n log log n in
  any case

  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the multiple
  polynomial quadratic sieve'' which takes time expOlog n
  log log nfaster than the number field sieve for small n
  but slower for large n The breakeven point is somewhere between 
  and  digits depending on the implementations

  Factorization is a fastmoving fieldthe state of the art just a few
  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now If no new methods are
  developed then bit RSA keys will always be safe from
  factorization but one can't predict the future Before the number
  field sieve was found many people conjectured that the quadratic
  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be

 What about other publickey cryptosystems

  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe
  But there are lots of other publickey systems around many of which
  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be
  difficult This has been just a brief introduction if you really want
  to learn about the many facets of publickey cryptography consult the
  books and journal articles listed in part

 What is a oneway hash function

  A typical oneway hash function takes a variablelength message and
  produces a fixedlength hash Given the hash it is computationally
  impossible to find a message with that hash in fact one can't
  determine any usable information about a message with that hash not
  even a single bit For some oneway hash functions it's also
  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the
  same hash

  A oneway hash function can be private or public just like an
  encryption function Here's one application of a public oneway hash
  function like MD or Snefru Most publickey signature systems are
  relatively slow To sign a long message may take longer than the user
  is willing to wait Solution Compute the oneway hash of the message
  and sign the hash which is short Now anyone who wants to verify the
  signature can do the same thing

  Another name for oneway hash function is message digest function

 What is the difference between public private secret shared etc

  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a
  very small set of concepts When an algorithm depends on a key which
  isn't published we call it a private algorithm otherwise we call it
  a public algorithm We have encryption functions E and decryption
  functions D so that DEM  M for any message M We also have
  hashing functions H and verification functions V such that VMX  
  if and only if X  HM

  A publickey cryptosystem has public encryption and private
  decryption Checksums such as the application mentioned in the
  previous question have public hashing and public verification
  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public
  verification only one person can produce the hash for a message
  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct

  Obviously when an algorithm depends on a private key it's meant to
  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key There's no real
  difference between a shared'' key and a private key a shared key
  isn't published so it's private If you encrypt data for a friend
  rather than for your eyes only'' are you suddenly doing
  sharedkey encryption'' rather than privatekey encryption No

 What are MD and MD

  MD and MD are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest
  Definitions appear in RFC  and RFC  see part  Code is
  available from FTPMD

  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD draft
  RFC The corrected algorithm should be called MDa though some
  people refer to it as MD

 What is Snefru

  Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph
  Merkle Snefru is an round function the newest in the family
  Definitions appear in Merkle's paper MEa Code is available from
  FTPSF

 What is the National Security Agency NSA

  The NSA is the official security body of the US government It
  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 's and
  has continued research in cryptology till the present The NSA is
  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world
  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the
  world Governments in general have always been prime employers of
  cryptologists The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many
  years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break
  many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national
  security almost all information about the NSA is classified

  Bamford's book BAMFD gives a history of the people and operations of
  the NSA The following quote from Massey MAS highlights the
  difference between public and private research in cryptography

   if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government
  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted
  behind closed doors Without doubt the number of workers engaged
  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of
  those engaged in open research in cryptology For only about 
  years has there in fact been widespread open research in
  cryptology There have been and will continue to be conflicts
  between these two research communities Open research is common
  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open
  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in
  scholarly journals But can a government agency charged with
  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations
  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break Can
  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might
  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's codebreakers
  One might argue that publication of a provablysecure cipher would
  force all governments to behave like Stimson's gentlemen' but one
  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with
  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most
  scientific fields The wonder is not that some conflicts have
  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in
  cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which
  we are aware have been so few and so mild''

 What are the US export regulations

  In a nutshell there are two government agencies which control
  export of encryption software One is the Bureau of Export
  Administration BXA in the Department of Commerce authorized by
  the Export Administration Regulations EAR Another is the Office
  of Defense Trade Controls DTC in the State Department authorized
  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ITAR As a rule
  of thumb BXA which works with COCOM has less stringent
  requirements but DTC which takes orders from NSA wants to see
  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA

  The newsgroup misclegalcomputing carries many interesting
  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what
  people think about those laws and many other complex issues which
  go beyond the scope of technical groups like scicrypt Make sure to
  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in
  jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at
  least heard of the ITAR

 What is TEMPEST

  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer
  equipment It was created in response to the discovery that
  information can be read from computer radiation eg from a CRT at
  quite a distance and with little effort

  Needless to say encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext
  is available this way

 What are the Beale Ciphers and are they a hoax

  Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for
  corrections

  The story in a pamphlet by J B Ward  goes Thomas
  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass
  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County Virginia leaving
  three ciphers with an innkeeper the ciphers describe the
  location contents and intended beneficiaries of the treasure
  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher contents called B
  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the
  Declaration of Independence DOI as key B and B are unsolved
  many documents have been tried as the key to B

  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B by various
  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure

  The Beale Cypher Association
  PO Box 
  Beaver Falls PA 

  You can get the ciphers from the recpuzzles FAQL by including the
  line

  send index

  in a message to netlibperegrinecom and following the directions
  There are apparently several different versions of the cipher
  floating around The correct version is based on the  pamphlet
  says John King kingjhpcccorphpcom

  Some believe the story is a hoax Kruh KRU gives a long list of
  problems with the story Gillogly GIL decrypted B with the DOI
  and found some unexpected strings including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP
  Hammer president of the Beale Cypher Association agrees that this
  string couldn't appear by chance but feels there must be an
  explanation Gwyn scicrypt expert is unimpressed with this
  string

 What is the American Cryptogram Association and how do I get in touch

  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography with an emphasis
  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with
  pencilandpaper or computers Its organ The Cryptogram'' includes
  articles and challenge ciphers Among the more than  cipher types in
  English and other languages are simple substitution Playfair
  Vigenere bifid Bazeries grille homophonic and cryptarithm

  Dues are  for one year  issues more outside of North America
  less for students under  and seniors Subscriptions should be sent
  to ACA Treasurer  West Hickory St Mundelein IL 

 Is RSA patented

  Yes The patent number is  filed  granted 
  For further discussion of this patent whether it should have been
  granted algorithm patents in general and related legal and moral
  issues see comppatents and misclegalcomputing For information
  about the League for Programming Freedom see FTPPF Note that one of
  the original purposes of comppatents was to collect questions such as
  should RSA be patented'' which often flooded scicrypt and other
  technical newsgroups into a more appropriate forum

 What about the Voynich manuscript

  nelsonreededu Nelson Minar says there is a mailing list on the
  subject  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list
  is voynichrequestrandorg

  the ftp archive is randorgpubvoynich

  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself of
  course A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site Kahn's

For your application what you can do is to encrypt the realtime clock
value with a secret key

Well almost If I only had to solve the problem for myself and were
willing to have to type in a second password the secret key whenever I
logged in it could work However I'm trying to create a solution that
anyone can use and which once installed is just as effortless to start up
as the nonsolution of just using xhost to control access I've got
religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers

For a good discussion of cryptographically good random number
generators check out the draftietfsecurityrandomnesstxt
Internet Draft available at your local friendly internet drafts
repository

Thanks for the pointer It was good reading and I liked the idea of using
several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function However unless I
missed something the only source they suggested aside from a hardware RNG
that seems available and unguessable by an intruder when a Unix is
freshbooted is IO buffers related to network traffic I believe my
solution basically uses that strategy without requiring me to reach into
the kernel

A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic
hash function eg MD when fed with a large amount of
moreorless random data For example running MD on devmem is a
slow but random enough source of random bits there are bound to be
 bits of entropy in the tens or hundreds of megabytes of data in
a modern workstation's memory as a fair amount of them are system
timers io buffers etc

I heard about this solution and it sounded good Then I heard that folks
were experiencing times of  seconds to run this on
reasonablyconfigured workstations I'm not willing to add that much delay
to someone's login process My approach etherfindcompress skip K takes
a second or two to run I'm considering writing the beall and endall of
solutions that launches the MD and simultaneously tries to suck bits off
the net and if the net should be sitting SO idle that it can't get K
after compression before MD finishes use the MD This way I could have
guaranteed good bits and a deterministic upper bound on login time and
still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds

Getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable
all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver
as I understand the proposal I could be wrong but I've seen no
mention of session keys being the escrowed entities

True in theory  In practice  The technology of cellular phones will
probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext
without the key  If the frequency path depends on they key as I
understand it to it could be made effectively impossible to record

Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access  The
telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant  That's the rule
today

But even so the evidence would not be admissible I think unless the
judge so ordered  I think that even interception of the crypttext
without a warrant would be illegal   Cops can't record today's plain
cellular calls and then ask a judge Hey can we have permission to
listen to those tapes can they

worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main
concern of most of us I think The camel's nose in the tent etc

Yes that is a major concern but I think that they think they can
win just by having  of the USA use this system  They don't even
have to care about the cautious  that's left  They don't catch the
really smart crooks anyway   John Gotti who would have to be retarded
not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away
on his tapped phone about murder plans  That's why he's in jail now
Hard to believe but true


This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would
fight a lot harder  They like this enough that they are dropping the so
called Digital Telephony proposal according to rumours  However the
meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext
on telco systems and that requires a bit of work

 It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow
 houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure
 
 It's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are
 good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses
 
 What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you
 at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that
 a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your
 cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
 escrow houses

Getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable
all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver
as I understand the proposal I could be wrong but I've seen no
mention of session keys being the escrowed entities

As the EFF noted this raises further issues about the fruits of one
bust leading to incrimination in other areas

But is it any worse than the current unsecure system It becomes much
worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main
concern of most of us I think The camel's nose in the tent etc

And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is
increased thus allowing greater access to central office records by
the government the conversations being encrypted who will object to
letting the government have access to them perhaps even automatically
archiving large fractions This was one of the main objections to
the S proposal that it would force telecom suppliers to provide
easy access for the government

One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted
conversations now all it takes is one misstep one violation that
gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt all of them

Do we want anyone to have this kind of power

Fascinating  Most of the content of the White House announcements was
in what was not said  It gives us almost nothing of value threatens to
take away a lot and does it with a sincere smile on its face
and the nice friendly word Management

			      FACT SHEET
		     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The first thing it doesn't say is We're giving you stronger encryption
what it says is 
   the U S Government has developed a microcircuit that not only
   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust
   than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of
   the keys needed to unlock the encryption  The system for the
   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to
   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization
But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now
so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break
At best it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break since they
need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a bruteforce search
for the other bit key

Similarly it didn't say We're making encryption is commercially available
because encryption is already commercially available including
forms the NSA may not be able to break like tripleDES or IDEA
And phone companies could offer DESbased systems now if they were
convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money

The next thing it didn't say is We're making encryption legal
because of course encryption has always been legal and the
President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree
What it did say was
	In making this decision I do not intend to prevent the
	private sector from developing or the government from approving
	other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in
	assuring both privacy and a secure key escrow system
which clearly means We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys
Soon  Once business buys into this

Another thing it didn't say is We're going to ask Congress for money
to do lots more wiretapping because of course there's a budget crisis
and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash
What it did say was
   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
   law enforcement communications  Further the Attorney General
   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase
which means We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to
buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NONAPPROVED CRYPTO
that's what preserve the government's ability to conduct  surveillance 
means

Interestingly enough in designing the escrow we may want to use some
rather unusual technology such as sealed boxes of paper or
destructive read memory rather than typical computer databases which
is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys

The greatest danger of the escrow database if it were kept on disk
would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out  You
can design lots of protection but with enough corruption a complete
copy is always possible   Storing it on paper or something very hard
to copy at once may actually make sense  Or a medium that can't be
copied  for example something with very slow access times or which
leaves a destructive trail if it is even read

Of course then it's hard to backup  However I think the consequences
of no backup  the data is not there when a warrant comes  are worse
than the consequences of a secret backup

An audit trail that reveals when data has been access that can't be
erased by the humans involved is also necessary

Right on the heels of the Clinton registered encryption key debacle comes

sphughessfsuvaxsfsuedu Shaun P Hughes writes
From yesterdays SF Chronicle

President Clinton has asked Congress for authority to spend more money
on spy agencies satellites and other intelligence activities in fiscal
 than it allotted for  congressional and administration
officials say 

 Clinton had promised to slash intelligence spending by  billion
over four years

 Although the size of the nations' vast intelligence budget remains
an official secret administration and congressional officials disclosed

Oh great Wonderful news Nobody can listen inexcept the feds

And anybody who can get the keys from the escrow company  This is a
database that's going to take plenty of updating  they think they can
keep it secure  Please  and that's just primary not secondary
sources such as police using the key under a warrant  Would anyone
be surprised if they just neglected to erase the key if it turned
out they couldn't nail you on anything

traffic That way your traffic looks normal and perhaps anyone
desiring to listen in won't even bother since they know nobody's
going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for
important stuff


Nice to think but naive  The fact is that millions of people today
are sending highly confidential information over unencoded easy to
receive cellular phones  They figure the chances of being heard are
small so they risk it

And  of people don't understand crypto the way the least of the
scicrypt newbies does   If Clinton tells them it's good crypto
they'll believe him and send important stuff over it and be thankful
that they're no longer using clearvoice FM cellular phones

Only a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto  Worse in the
eyes of the government which swears up and down the algorithim is
spooklevel secure and it may indeed be the only reason you could
possibly want this extra level is to avoid police

By using it you'll attract attention as a likely lawbreaker

Your honour the suspect suddenly started using another level of
cryptography and we can't tap his phone calls any more  He must
have something to hide  Please sign the warrant to search his

a second or two to run I'm considering writing the beall and endall of

the net and if the net should be sitting SO idle that it can't get K
after compression before MD finishes use the MD This way I could have
guaranteed good bits and a deterministic upper bound on login time and
still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds


 seconds to hash M of core I bet I know who the source of your

process But if you are going to use network traffic as the source of
pseudorandom information do the right thing and pass it through a
cryptographic hash function not a compressor Aside from the fact
that it will run faster it will give better results think of a
cryptographic hash as a function that distills randomness
Something along the lines of 
	etherfind t x n   dd bsk count devnull  md
should do the trick t gives you timestamps and the lack of u makes
sure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K The above
takes a couple of seconds on a lightlyloaded ethernet

is if me and a partner in crime had unique Encryptiondecryption

Though some may argue about the nose of the camel it's worth noting that
the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony If it is only
used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file
encryption then it IS an improvement over the current massproduced
standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to
easytobreak inverters

Try reading between the lines David  there are strong hints in there
that they're angling for NREN next and the only conceivable meaning of
applying this particular technology to a computer network is that they
intend it to be used in exclusion to any other means of encryption

Don't be lulled by the wedge because its end looks so thin

Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
laid   In many ways it would be a positive step if they had to
Judges set time limits on warrants I assume  

Under the relevant federal law  USC sec d the
authorizing judge must notify the targets within  days after the tap
period with extensions expires  This is the normal practice

Of course no wiretap law would be complete without the Unless Clause
which in subsection d reads like this On an ex parte showing
ie by the gov't without opposition since that would obviously
involve notice to the targets of good cause to a judge of competent
jurisdiction the serving of the inventory required by this subsection

A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available
for anonymous ftp

agrep   a fast approximate patternmatching tool

source code project available from

csarizonaedu 

in directory agrep

agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous
number of powerful search options  The one most obviously
applicable to cryptography key selection is to be able to
specify the similarity of matches in the data

For example say you make up a passwordphrase of qimwel
Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not
in any dictionary or word list  But how close is it to
en entry that could be varied by some crack program to
bruteforce search for it

You use agrep to find out  Looking with argument for none
one or two errors no matches  Good so far  But 

agrep  qimwel bigwordandphraselist

finds that the pattern qimwel is too close to the
pattern imsel part of himself and a host of others
to be of any cryptographic value as a key

An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of
letters like teh for the  A minimally acceptable password
would have to pass as least level  in order not immediately
ruledout as even a remote possibility of being a good password
In real cryptographic use my personal passphrases clear at
least level  on my rather large  meg word and phrase lists


And for searching for key words in humantyped data lots o'
typos the tool is unexcelled  For example For example
say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's
SF book Neuromancer in the huge SFLover's archives
Even with an error distance specification as small as
of  I will find all those people who think the title
was Necromancer or other common typos  Why miss anything

Also the program can look for up to  patterns IN PARALLEL
at BoyerMoore sublinear speeds  Great for a NSA wannabe
to look for your name terrorists names special Tagalog or
religious words etc in the news or email spool directories

You can even search for ciphertext by using say 
random threebyte combinations and eliminate all texts that
don't score the X chisquare 'birthday' hits on message size Y

You think some cryptoterrorist is try to foil you by changing
the pattern on you  No problem  Try agrep p NSA to find
NSA National Security Agency NSecAg No Such Agency
National Scrabble Association NSA etc

You can also specify fixed areas looking for license
plate XYZ when you know that the letters are correct
you might say

agrep  XYZ licenseplatedatabase

will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors
addition substitution deletion in the number area  You can
also weight the relative cost for substiutions additions
or deletion errors  For example when searching DNA patterns
for a particular protein combination you might know that
some kinds of damage cause the A nucelotide to drop out more
than other errors you could adjust for this bias by setting
Dc where you set the deletion cost to count as c errors

A steganographic use I even used agrep  stegeograp E
just now to find the correct spelling would be to intentionally
introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext
and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe  Lots of
possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext

Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy
to abstract the hits into a useful form  For example

agrep d From 'PGPpassphraseZimmermanNSA'

says output the entire mail record delimited by 'From'
that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase'
'Zimmerman' or 'NSA'

And agrep has been measured an orderofmagnitude faster
than the secondbest similarity tool publicly available

As usual I will be glad to email the source and docs
to those who reqest them by email IF they cannot do
an anonymous FTP

Get this now
It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA

I'd desparately prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments
that went on ad infinitum last time  That's especially true for
scicrypt  For that matter I've created altprivacyclipper since
the traffic is appearing in many different groups right now

I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my
followup to scicrypt  Frankly if you're not an absolutist your
feelings may turn on some of these issues  For example  with an
bit key simply splitting it into two bit pieces is much less
acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one
repository is shall we say overly pliable a wouldbe eavesdropper
would need to recover just  more bits of key  I need not point out
in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search
A slightly more complex scheme  XORing the key with a random number
and then with its complement  would produce two bit subkeys
neither of which is useful alone  That variant is much more resistant
to attack  Clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect
the subkeys even more

Other thoughts  Some people have noted the size and complexity of
the databases necessary  But the id strings the phones emit could be
their back door key doubleencrypted with the escrow repositories'
public keys  For that matter they could do that only with session
keys and have no back door at all  In that case the FBI would have
to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted  This
would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you
make sure they stop''

We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back
door  have the switch do the tap but with a digitallysigned record
of the time phone number etc of the call  That provides proof to
the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of
the warrant

I can suggest other variations too  Suppose each Clipper chip had 
public key pairs  Each would be used  times after which you'd need
more keying material  Not a bad idea in any event  This could be
used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant
the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very
long

I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure  Apart from
the obvious  why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the
back door  I think that the government is still genuinely concerned
about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets  This
scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too  I've heard
rumors over the years that some factions within NSA were unhappy with
DES because it was too good  Not that they couldn't crack it but it
was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want  They're keeping
the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations
without the back door

The cryptographic protocol though is another matter  I see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret and  as I hope I've shown above  there
are a lot of ways to do things that aren't quite as bad

This announcement is somewhat disconcerting it doesn't do anything
evil in and of itself but bodes badly for the future of open
algorithms and standards in information security  I won't start
panicking untilunless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited but
I'm a little anxious  No doubt it won't be long before someone posts
explaining how this just a small part of some farranging and
longlived NSAPKPIRSFBICIAHandgunControlIncClinton conspiracy to
subvert freedom democracy and mathematics  My feeling is that the
administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and
RSA and PGP and RIPEM since they'll never be used by a group much
wider than us computer geeks

The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things

  The NSA has been working on this for a long time and it only just
    now happened to be ready'' to release to the world at this time

  The NSA has been working on this for a long time but wasn't able
    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan  I
    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy
    for the unescrowed use of cryptography more likely the
    administration felt that even escrowed secretalgorithm and for
    all we know trivially breakable cryptography should not be made
    widely available

Thus said clippercsrcncslnistgov Clipper Chip Announcement
This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

The majority of the discussion involving this Clipper Chip seems to
pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations  Does anyone
know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
signals  The language sort of suggests this but it's hard to say

The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques  Anybody know

I'm guessing symmetric but they don't get very clear about it  If it
is symmetric how is it useful for anything other than linklevel
encryption with an identical chip at each end  How can you negotiate
a persession key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted
third party who knows your key  Or does it even use a persession
key

If it's asymmetric what about PKP's patents which they claim cover
all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography  Are they getting
royalties or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the
algorithm secret

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic ie In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank

	I was thinking about this also It's quite possible the
system transmits in clear the serial number of the device being
used That way they can start a tap get the serial number and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key

	If they tap someone who's apparently using encryption but
don't find that prefix then they'll assume it's an unauthorized
encryption scheme

From the limited details released so far It seems that the clipper chip 
system must employ some sort of public key cryptography Otherwise the key 
management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system 
unworkable It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place
at the start of each call Thats how they would identify the private key in 
their data base

This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key 
algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP  RSADSI The former is 
rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making
chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard If the feds
are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that 
could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the US   

As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto they are trying to coopt it Their contention that they 
need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm More likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont 
have the keys registered Anyone else notice that in their QA session they
talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but
carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed
They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without 
court order even though tapping a phone line requires one Also pick up on 
their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright
I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all legal ways
possible

I saw this article posted in a local newsgroup  I haven't seen it
or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups
which I subscribe to  So I am posting it here so others can read it
check it out and comment on it and provide ideas for handling these
sorts of things

I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this
article but if accurate I find it extremely disturbing especially in
light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy I understand
it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license or to register
a car and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards
wiretap proposals and such  One simply wonders what other gems are in
the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government  Perhaps
suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from
acquiring the force of law would be useful  The cost simply outweighs
any possible benefits IMO

BTW reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been
promoting in an even more disturbing form

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary



For Immediate Release                           April  


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and
law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

A stateoftheart microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has
been developed by government engineers  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology  It can be used in new
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

A keyescrow system will be established to ensure that the
Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of lawabiding
Americans  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                


keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the
device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately
in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap

The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices  In addition respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
approaches that can both provide lawabiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches like the keyescrow system
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates

        the privacy of our citizens including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes

        the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data under proper court or other legal
          order when necessary to protect our citizens

        the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace and 

        the need of US companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed



                                

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information  This infrastructure of highspeed networks
information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV
programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available  

For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of
Standards and Technology  




QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations

A   No  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans

Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message

A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
     court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system

Q   Who will run the keyescrow data banks

A   The two keyescrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities  At this point the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the keyescrow data banks

Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is  

A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities

Q   Whose decision was it to propose this product

A   The National Security Council the Justice Department the
     Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet
     officials

Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative

Q   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers

A   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them

Q   Who provides the Clipper Chip

A   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance
     California and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future

Q   How do I buy one of these encryption devices 

A   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the Clipper Chip into their devices
     
Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure more convenient and less expensive
     than others readily available today but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology which the Administration is
     developing

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

Q   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration  

A   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and publicinterest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism

Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware

A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements  Casebycase review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices  The
     same is true for other encryption devices  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to US companies operating at home and abroad  With this
     in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     casebycase basis for US companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products

The SDNS protocols for example make explicit provision for multiple

mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it

Mind you I'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be

Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business
or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
systems

RSA might be in position to do it if they had active cooperation of
a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones

Large companies in the voicedata comm business are out because they
all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them

If we as professionals in crypto organizations EFF etc were to
put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
crypto standard for transmission and getting our companies to
implement it we might avoid government control

Otherwise I think it will happen to us by default  Gov isn't probably
strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt  They
are strong enough and we may be foolish enough to push through
the Clipper Chip

Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this  I for one
would gladly pay royalties via purchasing secure phones

If not this we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented
in either SW or HW and publish it then push to make it the defacto
standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such

We are opposing charging the bunker  We should be nimble and clever
The gov is strong not clever

Hear hear I completely agree that we need to work quickly to
establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper As Brad
Templeton and others have noted once the Clipper becomes ensconced in
enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the legal
standard and it will become the market standard as well There is
a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is
mandated about whether nonescrow alternatives will be allowed etc

There are also unclear issues about how hard or how illegal it will
be to make workalikes which meet the standard but which generate
phony or untappable keysI'm sure the next several weeks will see
these issues thrashed out in this and other groups

Meanwhile I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction
Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies the usual
complaints about MailSafe costing too much at  or so and the
general issue of software patents we may find that allying
ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do What's a mere
licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake If everyone who
wanted true security paid say  for a lifetime use of all of
RSA's patentswhich expire in the period  or sothen RSA
would make tons of money and be happy I'm sure A small price to pay
For those to whom  sounds like too much I'm sure the actual terms
could be different spread out over several years whatever To me
it's a small price to pay

Strong crypto means strong privacy Escrowing keys sending copies of
keys to large databases and splitting keys into two bit pieces
all done with secret and nonanalyzable protocols and algorithms is
NOT strong crypto

Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of
patenting number theory applications this minor issue pales in
comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal note
that I said potentialwe'll presumably learn more in the coming
months

The RSA algorithms are at least public have been analyzed and
attacked for years and source code is available to better ensure no
deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors

I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems
using offtheshelf hardware like Soundblaster boards for the PC and
CELPtype software The new generations of PCs using fast s and
Pentiums are fast enough to do realtime voice encryption Combined
with DiffieHellman key exchange this should provide an alternative
to the Clipper system

Of course we don't really know if the Administration proposes to
outlaw competing systems It seems to me that their goal of tapping
terrorists child pornographers and Hilary bashers would be thwarted
if lowcost alternatives to Clipper proliferated Not to defend child
pornographers or terrorists but limiting basic freedoms to catch a
few criminals is not the American way of doing things End of soapbox
mode

I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had
with RSA and don't look at meI have both MacPGP and a fully
legal copy of MailSafe and instead work with them as quickly as we can

One presumes the system could work as follows

a Blank clips are manufactured by Mykotronx and VLSI  The number
produced is carefully audited and they are shipped to the first
escrow house

It programs the chips with its half the key and prints out a paper slip
with the key half and nonsecret chip serial number   The reams of paper
are filed in locked boxes in the vault a fuse is burnt in the chip so
that the key is now unreadable

The chip then goes to the next escrow house where the same thing is
done  This continues through N escrow houses perhaps could be more than


The last one provides the chip to the cellular phone maker

And yes this has to be a public key system or it would be almost
impossible to handle  It might not be RSA but that does not mean
that PKP doesn't get paid  Until  PKP has the patent on the
general concept of public key encryption as well as the particular
implementation known as RSA

But is it any worse than the current unsecure system It becomes much
worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper

	Not to pick on Mr May in particular of course but isn't this
kind of the domino theory When one little country falls its neighbor
will surely follow and before you know it we're all mining salt
in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings

I wish I could agree with you  Ask yourself this  Why would any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least
partially compromised Key escrows in this instance  Why would any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated  ie algorythm not publically released
The answer seems obvious to me they wouldn't  There is other hardware out
there not compromised  DES as an example triple DES as a better one

My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper
systems  If not we're in trouble

Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid although we'd like
to think so I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this
They know their initiative will fail much as crippled DES was never taken
seriously  The only way their moves can work is by coercion  You know
little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step
in the next move it makes NO sense otherwise  The next move banning
or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the Clipper system is easily
justified Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying
to subvert the government  We've provided you with a very secure alternative
so use it or go to jailbe finedwhatever
How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing
law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system
the only crypto available in the US   You simply can't and the administration
knows it  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt out of their hair be it for
drug dealing or whatever would just buy still available nonclipper systems

Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short they can't be THAT stupid
Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations
collective IQ is about that of a potato

Why do you think ATT jumped on so fast  They know it's going to be big
and NOT because it's better  Right on the face of it noone will buy the
stuff that doesn't have to  ATT must know this too THINK MAN why the
hell would they jump the gun

I really wonder

The White House
Office of the Press Secretary co
Presidential Comment Line fax
 
 
April  
 
Sir andor Madam
 
 
I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and
cryptography  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life
 
It is apparent to me that those who drafted the Clipper Chip Proposal which is incidentally gaining notoriety as the Big Brother Proposal are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm especially one destined for standardization is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep





ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from experts without full disclosure is plain ignorance
 
In addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such as DES when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow no matter how tamper proof the key escrows might be
 
I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws  I can only assume then that the drafters of the Clipper Chip Proposal knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector  The only way this proposal makes any sense or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti





lize the Big Brother Chip
 
Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like harmony right to encryption and voluntary
 
It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is I can't believe it's happening here  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant When is the Reichstag fire planned for

Your honour the suspect suddenly started using another level of
cryptography and we can't tap his phone calls any more  He must
have something to hide  Please sign the warrant to search his

What they would need to do though is make sure that nobody has
access to decent crypto in the first place  They probably can't
tell Clippered voice from Clippered tripleDESed voice until they
get their copy of your key  Any criminal who's going to use
encryption will do it under cover of Clipper  The only way to avoid
this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption

I probably shouldn't say this but they could try to detect the use
of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
properties of the plaintext  An oldfashioned wiretap could then
detect the use of preencryption which would drastically increase
the measured entropy of the input  A countermeasure to this would
be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice

You can tell if the NSA built this feature in blow on the mike and
observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling

Marc VanHeyningen mvanheyncsindianaedu writes

The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques  Anybody know

I don't know but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone

Several people have suggested that the chips use publickey cryptography
Another possibility is to use DiffieHellman key exchange or some other
algorithm which has a similar effect  DH allows both ends to agree on
a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography something
like DES for the encryption

How could the back door keys work in this system  I can see a few
possibilities  One is that the DHlike algorithm has the property that
the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door
keys for one or possibly both communicants  Perhaps the random numbers
used in the DH are seeded by the back door key or some such

Another possibility as was suggested here earlier is that the chips
simply broadcast the session key encrypted with the chip's own
internal secret key  In this system the back door keys are secret keys
usable for decrypting this session key broadcast  Actually the chip's
secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage but can be
identical to the secret backdoor key  This proposal seems most
straightforward to me

Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the
message itself has a dual key property that possession of either of
two keys can be used to decrypt it  One key would be the session key from
the DH exchange and the other would be the back door key for the chip

It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised
during her amazingly prescient online discussion last November and
December was a variation on DiffieHellman in which a third party would
participate in deriving the session keys  This doesn't quite fit into
what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early
knowledge of Clipper or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with
Clipper designers may have had DiffieHellman on their minds

In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals I'd love to
see a UNIXbased encryption scheme that

 Kept some files encrypted on the host machine say all the files in your
   home directory
 Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a
   modem line

It seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a
way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not among other things

I'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system

Does such a system exist  If it were made easytouse and readily
available I think it would be a Good Thingtm  I realize that this
would probably just involve putting a nice frontend on a readily available
and very secure encryption scheme but it should be done

Thanks for the ear

And yes this has to be a public key system or it would be almost
impossible to handle  It might not be RSA but that does not mean
that PKP doesn't get paid  Until  PKP has the patent on the
general concept of public key encryption as well as the particular
implementation known as RSA

Hmm my first thought was that they're using DiffieHellman exponential
session key exchange or an equivalent  However the DiffieHellman
patent like the HellmanMerkle one on public key systems claims
all equivalents so the basic point stands

Interestingly a quote from Jim Bidzos showed up in the media real
soon after the announcement and he sounded very pissed  Maybe he hadn't
yet realized that PKP might have just struck gold  All they have to
do is get someone to admit the general scheme that the Clipper uses

The greatest danger of the escrow database if it were kept on disk
would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out  You

Of course then it's hard to backup  However I think the consequences
of no backup  the data is not there when a warrant comes  are worse
than the consequences of a secret backup

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes you effectively have
secure crypto  If secret backups are keptthen you effectively have
no crypto  Thus this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better
than secure crypto

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes then the government will
just have to use normal law enforcement techniques to catch crooks  Is
this so bad   BTW bugging isn't YET a normal law enforcement technique
With the privacy clipper it WILL become a normal technique

I probably shouldn't say this but they could try to detect the use
of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
properties of the plaintext  An oldfashioned wiretap could then
detect the use of preencryption which would drastically increase
the measured entropy of the input  A countermeasure to this would
be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice

This way to detect preencryption may be defeated  one can do  
transformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some 
prearranged in the beginning of communication function
I think so Say you can do FFT of your encrypted signal
Just thinking

I wish I could agree with you  Ask yourself this  Why would any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least
partially compromised Key escrows in this instance  Why would any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated  ie algorythm not publically released
The answer seems obvious to me they wouldn't  There is other hardware out
there not compromised  DES as an example triple DES as a better one

What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
flames please  It comes out of a background of  years as a senior
corporate staff executive in two Fortune  companies

I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big  accounting firms

I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap
doorsI'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
Swiss or anybody Japanese

This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would
feel the same way Mostmanysome pick one corporations have an attitude
that the NSA is part of our government and we support our government as
one very famous CEO put it to me one day

Just some perspective from another point of view

Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative

Congress  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR academia
the public internet users  Ive heard of topdown design but topdown 
democracy Just whose statedistrict are the chip manufacturers in

Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review bs about
     the wonderfulness of the key escrow system

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done 

They'll just provide an easilycompromised version to JQ Public

                         nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  

Maybe we need a CRA  Cryptographic Rights Amendment

                                                  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

Nice lullaby  But why am I not soothed

   I have lurked here a bit lately and though some of the math is
unknown to me found it interesting I thought I would post an article I
found in the Saturday April   Toronto Star

                  'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy

   Washington REUTER  President Bill CLinton announced yesterday a
plan to plant a new Clipper Chip in every government telephone and
computer line to prevent eavesdropping

   Eventually the chips developed by the government's National
Institute for Standards and Technology would be used by commercial and
private electronics communication users

   The White House said that to assure privacy each device containing
the encryption devices would be assigned two unique keys  numbers
that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages

   The attorneygeneral has been assigned the task of arranging that the
keys are deposited in two keyescrow data bases Access to them would
be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap the White House said in a statement

I know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard

already fired off a letter of protest to NIST

My point I suspect this list interesting as it is for various
reasons does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together
Some of them yes Others no

It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost 
irrelevant  if I cannot choose the key but have to use a key chosen for
me by the foundry the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good
or as bad as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc

It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER 
MANUFACTURED  after all we are talking about  to  million keys that
will ever be manufactured The key depositories can be as secure and
incorruptible as they wish to be nobody cares anyway

Now if someone would convince me that the shipping docks of VTI ATT and
others are impenetrable remember the chips have to ship with the key  
you or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually
I'd be a bit happier But do we really believe that the various governments
including ours won't have the full lists of all the keys ever manufactured

Did I miss something here

Depends  Its possible that the phone sends its serial number in the

get that SN and then get the key for it  So swapping phones isn't
a problem for the gov't that is  They still know that this line
belongs to you so they just watch the line and see the SN and then
they get the key for that SN

   In either case I think we need to look at this a bit deeper'jblmWwxlD

Well I think this is understood  The major problem is that a lot of

sufficient to get a few people thinking about adding MIME support to news

IMHO we have a long way to go before the Unixspecific MUAs newsreaders etc
reach the service levels of the other commercial platforms  There ought to be
such a definition consisting of known object data types and rules for their

Yes  But there is also a long way to go before most Mac PC and Windows

Ed as usual makes a very good point

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an email  He composed it using the
Sun OpenWindows  mailtool which handles nonMIME attachments and the
like

Since I don't use mailtool I had to manually save it cut  paste and
then uudecode the actual attachment  What I got  after a notinconsiderable
amount of time spent doing this  was an audio file  The original message
was over Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data the resulting audio message
was a single sentence that I transcribed as a  character message

If he had sent me the sentence in plain text the email would have been
around  bytes and it would have taken me about  seconds to process it at
most  Instead it was k and it took at least a minute  A complete waste of
my time and bandwidth as far as I'm concerned  Sending plain text is still
the most efficient method of transmission given the same transport mechanism

The Clipper chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all
But lets ignore that for the moment

The fundamental question isCan the government stop me from using
encryption

Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes such as
Public Keys can the government stop me from using an encryption
process

If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is
truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers
depending upon which causes more damage and to whom

However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please who
cares about the clipper chip As far as I'm concerned a phone line
is insecure PERIOD I don't care if they encrypt it  ways from
sunday if I didn't do the encrypting I don't trust it This is the
attitude that everyone else should have Instead of worrying about a
clipper chip simply connect your handset to your computer and feed
the voice single through process encrypt and transmit over the
phone The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse

Can't work you say No Standard you say Obviously you have never
uses PGP

Anyone who expects the government to protect their freedoms is
kidding themselves Only you can protect your own freedoms

One final thought addressed to EFF
	Do you support the implementation of ANY form of
	encryption where the encryption key must be revealed
	If you do why If not why
	What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either
	support or stop this proposal
	If you do not support this proposal what alternatives do
	you offer

It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a
police agency  It just might be a bad idea for them too

OK suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone  They
need a warrant just like the old days  But unlike the old days they
now need to 

   a get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of
       the key

Now what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses
Posessionrelease of keys becomes a political bargaining chit  State
and lowerlevel police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics
while potentially good leads disappear lives and property are lost
statutes of limitations run out etc  Not to mention a moderately
clever person who suspects the police are after herhim will be buying
new phones faster than tap requests can be processed  Or using stolen
ones  Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting
without a dialing license

There's also bureacracy and security problems  within each escrow house 
how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated  Put in enough
safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with and 
it might take a LONG time to get that key  Even when a request is approved 
how is the key going to be disclosed  Will it be encrypted by a Clippertype
chip for transmission  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal
Government with a databank of the necessary size and data traffic of
the projected volume there's going to be a lot of weak links  How many of 
these kinds of problems will be open for public or expert scrutiny  

Furthermore the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around 
even to State Police agencies a trust and security issue  This would be 
an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a 
key resulting in lawsuits financial settlements and political 
embarassment  So the Feds implement it this way
 
   b some federal agency gets the keys performs the tap and
       turns the results over to the NY State Police

But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton
AidToUrbanAreas proposal  Or there just happens to be a turf war
going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case
Now not only do we have the keys as a political chit we have an
extra player in the game and we have the tap's tapes as another
bargaining chit  Again the State Police lose

I understand that legal wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain In
scenario b who pays the bill

 anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security You will
 notice that there is NO mention anywhere about safety for nonAmericans

Don't forget you are in the country that wouldn't let the Russians
buy Apple II's because of security concerns

Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes such as
Public Keys can the government stop me from using an encryption
process

Following precedent in other areas the government is likely to put a tax on
encryption technology  Once the tax is imposed it becomes a federal matter
and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or
FBI tossing grenades into your house  The BATF appears to be the logical
agency to enforce such regulations federal control over alocohol tobacco
and firearms is similary based on taxes

Look at the FCC they won't allow sale of any receiever that can receive
bands that are supposed to be private  This has nothing to do with any
desire to prevent harmful interference If the government can make a radio
receiver illegal what makes you think they won't claim the right to control
encryption

It looks like Dorothy Denning's wrongheaded ideas have gotten to the
Administration even sooner than we feared

I'd lay long odds that it was the other way around  Clinton didn't
just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices the NSA has to have
been working on it for years  While it's possible that Denning and
other prominent people just happened to start arguing for such a
system it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved
If this guess is wrong I apologize

I'm sure Dorothy Denning is an honest person and wouldn't lie to us
Simply think up a question to ask her about her involvement but be
very careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no Jesuitical
evasion or a true but wholly misleading answer

In this country MI are experts at answering these questions for
instance there was a British journalist Jonathon Moyle killed in South
America a couple of years ago  Parliament asked Was he an MI employee
No  turns out afterwards he wasn't paid therefore wasn't an employee
They could equally have said he wasn't an agent  he went abroad on his
private business with no brief from MI but was interviewed and debriefed
at length only on his return

  The dead giveaway is the repeated protestations that the new plan is aimed
at criminals drug dealers terrorists etc  You'd think the tactic
would be too obvious to trot out yet again after a decade of Sarah and the
rest of the Brady Bunch using it to destroy the Second Amendment but evidently
the control nuts feel it will serve them one more time

  As far as the export needs of American companies are concerned I could
almost believe that the plan to saddle the US industry with a hidden sabotaged
algorithm was invented by a cabal of Japanese lobbyists

Getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable
all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver
as I understand the proposal I could be wrong but I've seen no
mention of session keys being the escrowed entities

True in theory  In practice  The technology of cellular phones will
probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext
without the key  If the frequency path depends on they key as I
understand it to it could be made effectively impossible to record

I am not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic things
seem evident to me things which this Clinton Clipper do not address
The all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusions based on what
I have seen the membership of this group except for two notable persons
agree to  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory it
almost always ends up happening in fact  So the key is to make abuse
IMPOSSIBLE  Question authority and remember power DOES corrupt

I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be
expanded to include other data forms such as data transfer and stored
data and as such should be treated as if it were expanded or such
expansion will be almost impossible to stop using Clipper as a precident
There was a hint of that in the proposal remember  That said please
bear with me I am not very articulate so I take more words to say
what others could say much more briefly  Thank you

Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access  The
telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant  That's the rule
today

As I suggested this is NOW  The hint is in the proposal that this or
similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions
such as data transfer data files and such largely dependent on how
this thing is accepted or flies  I think one would be wise to treat
this in the manner one would when not if it gets expanded to other
areas than cellular phones  I think this is guaranteed to happen if
this proposal gets by  Salami politics  It has been and is used in
several other areas it is certain to be used here  Government is not
going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop
whenever they want to  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather
flimsy guarantee  If the case warrants they can always sieze the
material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on
periodically renewed contempt charges  So it is not denying the justice
system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty
or refuses to divulge the means to access the info  this is not
protected under the Fifth  one can be forced to perform ACTS that would
result in divulging incriminating evidence  So blocking restrictions
on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement  it
does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult  Especially
fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege  Don't give up the
right to be safe from that  that should be nonnegotiable and Clinton
and Co know it which is probably why they quietly developed this thing
figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through  How come
those consulted could be roughly described as us insiders  They cannot
quietely IMPLIMENT it though when they ban other schemes to ensure its
exclusive use  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone
Don't buy into it  Has government really earned that kind of trust
past or future  To be secure and free one must keep government honest
and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE not 'unlikely'
or 'difficult'

But even so the evidence would not be admissible I think unless the
judge so ordered  I think that even interception of the crypttext
without a warrant would be illegal   Cops can't record today's plain
cellular calls and then ask a judge Hey can we have permission to
listen to those tapes can they

So what  One could use information gained by reuse of the keys saved
after the last case was finished or other means master key backdoor
easily broken algorithm to find other evidence which given to a judge
would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise  This
has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past  For
local cops this might be workable to keep them honest but the Feds
have a workaround somehow BET on it  Does anyone really believe
for example that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen
in on scanning for keywords  either easily defeated in realtime or
via a 'master key'  I sure don't

This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use
oldfashioned police work to build a case  In the past eavesdropping
was rather easy with or without a court order  I think the Law
Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled and will resist changes
that require them to revert to using oldfashioned detective work  I
just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much
about civil and individual rights that puts people first  The question
is put people first to WHERE

With the innards not being revealed how is one to be sure there DOESN'T
exist a 'master key' for use by NSA etc so they can do their keyword
scan etc on conversations they routinely monitor without a specific
court order   Remember the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY
Bet on it  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that
they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found  What is to
keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time' After
awhile they would have quite a collection  Kept especially for folks
they deem 'disruptive'  And if they get only one key that would
reduce the search space a lot unless it is an RSA scheme  Remember
Nixon years  Need for court orders really slowed them down didn't it

And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled fat chance
I see one ending up being under say Treasury the other under Justice
 it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to
a competitor's Clinton Clipper or descendent when this idea is expanded
to be used for all nongovernment encryption  Enough bucks would get
one the keys or the innards for this algorithm  Perhaps not an important
concern but given past government behavior and the other problems

worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main
concern of most of us I think The camel's nose in the tent etc

Yes that is a major concern but I think that they think they can
win just by having  of the USA use this system  They don't even
have to care about the cautious  that's left  They don't catch the
really smart crooks anyway   John Gotti who would have to be retarded
not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away
on his tapped phone about murder plans  That's why he's in jail now
Hard to believe but true

What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption  You
can BET that if Clipper is accepted that will be next on the agenda
It is even hinted at in the proposal  read it carefully  Expect the
argumet well if you got nothing to hide  Fine Then using that
argument one should not object to video cameras being installed in
every room of one's home  Granted  an exteme expansion of the idea but
the principle holds  Private stuff should remain private even from a
govt fishing expedition  And lawsrules may change in the future as
to 'safeguards'  When it comes to the Fed Government safeguards are
pretty meaningless if they want to doget something

Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights or establish
bad precidents please  The price could be hell to pay later

This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would
fight a lot harder  They like this enough that they are dropping the so
called Digital Telephony proposal according to rumours  However the
meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext
on telco systems and that requires a bit of work

People would fight laws forbidding more NOW but in say two years
because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some
'drastic action' just this added reasonable restriction will only bother
those who have someting to hide etc  Please don't buy into it

If the Clinton Clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public
so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few
isolated 'respected experts' respected by whom  for what  Perhaps a
certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected
experts this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was
advocating if I recall   How would anybody know that what the
experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper
Chip if it is kept secret   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled
version with a 'master key' provision or features not present in the
version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts  And who
chooses the expertes  The government  No conflict of interest there


And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT
have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known
I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything
you have except for the keys I recall ideas presented to this
group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret

Another question  since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not
be used for government security they are regarding it as not real secure
but good enough for common folk  I think I would like to see a full
description not a PR nonstatement of just what good enough means
I think when saying how strong it is good enough really means not
very  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not
acceptable  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and
Constitution which the people not the governments of those other
countries often regard with envy  what we have as rights they have as
revokable privileges  And if we expect to retain those rights and
protections we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA
have this thing to 'fight crime'  We have allready have our Bill of
Rights pretty much torn to shreds  We should not permit more weakining
for yet another 'noble cause' instead we should be trying to repair
the damage  Our crime problem may have a number of causes but too
many rights and safeguards is not a signifigant one  A broken court
system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having
too many rights disregarding addressing the root causes for crime
etc

BTW  those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton believe
this  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights
under the Constitution or Bill of Rights  The last couple of decades
have been a nonstop series of endruns around the protections of the
Constitution  It has to stop  Now is as good a time as any if it
isn't too late allready

It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow
houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure

A very good point

It's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are
good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses

Why should we expect the cops to be honest  They're underpaid
for the risks they face every day  The media dumps on the all
the time and blames them for all sorts of discrimination
brutality  How can we expect them to be more than human

Besides there are lots of cases of police abuses ranging from
protection scams to outright robbery when I worked in DC there
was a breakin at a local Radio Shack and the alarm company heard the
cops responding to the call over the audio pickup in the store

What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you
at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that
a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your
cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
escrow houses

Then you would know that Big Brother had been listening  Does he
really want to let you know

Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
laid   In many ways it would be a positive step if they had to
Judges set time limits on warrants I assume  At the end of the time
limit they should have to renew or replace your chip

That's if we go with this scheme which I am not sure I agree with

I'm completely against anything that makes it easier for the
government to encroach on the rights of individuals  The
founders of this country spent a lot of effort limiting the power
of the government and specifying exactly what the governments
rights were and this didn't include a gov't spy in every
bedroom  IMHO there are entirely too many things going on
today designed to preserve the government organism at the expense
of individuals  Look around and reread  and many early
Heinlein books  Aren't there many parallels between the thought
police can you spell Waco Texas and Heinlein's Crazy Years''

Though some may argue about the nose of the camel it's worth noting that
the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony If it is only
used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file
encryption then it IS an improvement over the current massproduced
standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to
easytobreak inverters

Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap
Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
email and files let's focus on this

One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it

Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some I find the proposal
less threatening than many others since right now most Americans have no
secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can
eavesdrop This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and
cordless phones



Reading between the lines I infer that the system is highly secure
without access to the keys This would meet the needs of US businesses
confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including French and Japanese
security services and rich Japanese companies It allows the NSA to make
available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs

Most legitimate US corporations trust the NSA and would be delighted to
have a highsecurity system certified by them even at the price of
depositing keys in escrow I see no difficulty in creating a reliable
escrow Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the
week and that system has worked pretty well

From my point of view this is a fair starting point There are concerns that
need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows But in
return we get access to highsecurity crypto Many have suggested that DES
and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly
skilled and endowed There is at least a good possibility which should be
checked that the proposed system is not so breakable It doesn't have to
be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys
pursuant to a legitimate court order Thus they can protect legitimate
communications against economic adversaries while still being able to
eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order

crypto keys  I wouldn't

Subject Clipper Chip


Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times
etc about NIST National Institute of Standards  Technology
announcing the Clipper Chip crypto device Several messges
on the net have asked for more technical details and some have
been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given
the lack of details in the news  articles So here to help out
is your friendly NSA link me I was somewhat surprised Friday
to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing
details I was told the info was public so here it is the cc of this
to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my
facts since I assume he is aware of all this please let me know
if I have anything wrong

The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 
Silicon Each chip will have two secret bit keys One will be the 
same for all chips ie a systemwide key and the other will be unit 
specific I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them but I will 
call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message 
The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so 
that the system key can be kept secret Aside It is clear that 
they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion 
it may be as much for that as this stated purpose The unit key 
will be generated as the XOR of two bit random numbers K 
and K UKKK which will be kept by the two escrow 
authorities Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be 
decided by the Attorney General but it was stressed to me that 
they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies that they 
must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased 
When a law enforcement agency gets a court order they will 
present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K and 
K thereby allowing access to the unit key UK

In addition to the system key each user will get to choose his 
or her own key and change it as often as desired Call this key 
plain old K When a message is to be sent it will first be 
encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK 
and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
producing

     E EM K EK UK serial number  SK

When a court order obtains K and K and thence K the law 
enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information 
flowing on the suspected link Aside It is my guess that 
they may do this constantly on all links with or without a 
court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links 
over which a message will flow This gives the agency access to 

     EM K EK UK serial number

in the above message They then check the serial number 
of the unit and see if it is on the watch list for which they 
have a court order If so they will decrypt EK UK to obtain K 
and then decrypt EM K to obtain M

I am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do 
not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed 
scheme All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme 
more knowledgably But I will say that the need for just one court 
order worries me I would feel more comfortable though not 
necessarily comfortable if two separate court orders were 
needed one per escrow authority While no explanation is
needed the following story adds some color In researching
some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around
I spoke with Gerald Gunther the constitutional law expert
here at Stanford and he related the following story When
Edward Levi became Pres Ford's attorney general right
after Watergate he was visited by an FBI agent asking
for the wiretap authorizations When Levy asked for
the details so he could review the cases as required by
law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned
over  blank signed forms every time Levi did not
comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear 
No single person or authority should have the power to
authorize wiretaps or worse yet divulging of personal
keys Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi
and sometimes a John Mitchell

Subject Re Clipper Chip

It is fine to post my previous message to scicrypt 
if you also post this message with it in which

 I ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info 
from me or asking for comments on specific questions By
this posting I apologize for any messages I am unable to
respond to I already spend too much time answering too much
email and am particularly overloaded this week with other
responsibilities 

 I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning
She met with the person from NSA that
I talked with by phone so her understanding is likely to
better than mine on this point Where I said the transmitted
info is  E EM K EK UK serial number  SK
she says the message is not double encrypted The system
key or family key as she was told it is called only encrypts
the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted
unit key This is not a major difference but I thought it
should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to
my attention It makes more sense since it cuts down
on encryption computation overhead

    Oh great Wonderful news Nobody can listen inexcept the feds 

   Hey it's better than the status quo

   I am far less worried about the feds tapping my phone than high school 
   scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
   cordless phone calls

I'm a political dissident I'm scared shitless of the feds listening
in on my calls My opinions are the sort that would get me
disappeared in a slightly less free society  and who knows what
sort of society we will be in in five or ten years I have friends who
have had their phones tapped  none of this is theoretical to me

As for its better than the status quo well first of all you can
get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today  and they work
well In addition a number of groups are now working on building
software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now  and
they are all working in overdrive mode

   And yes I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted but this is at 
   least an incrememental improvement for certain applications

There ARE no crypto restrictions yet You can use anything you want
RIGHT NOW The point is to maintain that right

	Not to pick on Mr May in particular of course but isn't this
kind of the domino theory

As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly if you produce the
infrastructure that would permit a police state to function all that
is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of
attitude on the part of the government

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to
ensure freedom in our country They designed the system to make it
difficult for tyranny to arise For instance one of the reasons the
fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the
government to try to make smuggling a crime Think I jest John
Hancock made all his money smuggling rum which is after all a drug

Think about it The government has everyones keys in escrow and the
FBI gets their pet wiretap without leaving the office scheme There
is a coup which happens every day all around the world Within hours
everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being
monitored more closely than ever before possible

Without the tools being in place a tyranny cannot stand With tools
like this in place a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be
successfully imposed

Why give the government tools with which to enslave you Maybe you can
trust Bill Clinton but are you willing to tell me that you can trust
EVERY government that will ever arise in the US hereafter I am not
willing to make that leap of faith

Tim May whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime
                           
	Isn't this just a little melodramatic

I'm a political dissident As such I am acutely aware of what happens
to political dissidents in most of the world In most of the world I
could be killed for my beliefs Call Amnesty International some time
to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world

All that seperates the US from most of those places is a thin piece
of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and
more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs Coups have happened in
countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years
Governments throughout history have fallen No government has lasted
for more than a few hundred years Often they are replaced by
dictatorships Do you really believe so intensely that it could never
ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and
the lives of your children and other loved ones on it

If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced we
make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen because
if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually
stick 

Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where
hundreds that have gone before have failed Thriving democracies led
by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to
dictatorship Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled
men before they became a tyranny

I for one am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here
Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has
happened elsewhere

   I know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard
   of Clipper was in the Friday morning newspaper And another has
   already fired off a letter of protest to NIST

   My point I suspect this list interesting as it is for various
   reasons does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together
   Some of them yes Others no 

I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on
the list and does not know why he was added  I'm sure the same
applies to others on the list  So I guess my initial theory was
right that the clipper list was just someone's idea of a bad joke  I
guess I should be happy it wasn't a conspiracy

Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says There is
a global key G plus one key UC for each chip C The user can choose a
new session key KP for each phone call P he makes Chip C knows three
keys G its own UC and the user's KP The government as a whole
knows G and every UC Apparently a message M is encrypted as
EGEUCKPC  EKPM That's it

The system as described here can't possibly work What happens when
someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip To get M
the receiving chip needs KP to get KP the receiving chip needs UC
The only information it can work with is C If UC can be computed
from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key
escrow'' is bullshit Otherwise how is a message decrypted

the Executive Branch this system is more difficult to tap with than

As am I

If high quality secure NSA classified technology means handing my key
over to whomever I'll take PGP any day

Right now they are billing it as voluntary ie bend over here it comes

As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there how much
easier do you think it will be to redefine on your own to mean
write it yourself and don't even THINK about distributing it

Get honest no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised
already and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed

The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means
handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process
Since when has export control stopped anyone especially software wise

Ask yourself carefully if  high quality secure NSA classified technology 
is something they are going to hand out  Not unless you can drive a

  A remark I heard the other day is beginning to take on increasingly
frightening significance  The comment was made that In other parts
of the world the Democrats note the big D would be known as
Socialists 

We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government 
really couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the 
right wing pro establishment types Just about the only circumstances 
in which I could think that they would be interested in their political 
views would be to recruit them as spooks They can be guaranteed to give
the government line when it counts In US history it has been the 
socialists such as myself who have been persecuted 


Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which
the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force
lets try thinking

In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as
a defense project Therefore this is not a party matter at all George Bush
was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls he was chief spook 
remember

Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure They simply ask their
chums who they give huge defense contracts to motorola etc to be nice
boys After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the
chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms

Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the
same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist People might know
this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and 
Dewy version of political correctness  the sort with tribunals and show 
trials Ever seen Ed Meese pissed I have it was when he said that socialism
and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter
It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious

     There are some issues which come to mind when one considers
the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother
Clipper chip
     The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let
themselves be caught by using this type of encryption  In 
the New York Times reported that government investigators broke
up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated
equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to
eavesdrop on the lawenforcement agents who were trying to arrest
them
     A Mr Deely an NSA official said There are a lot of
mediumsized countries that would have been proud to have the
signals intelligence operation of this group
     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who
have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure
communications are  The press given to the Big Brother chip will
only increase their numbers
     Even if there is some benefit to lawenforcement through the
use of Big Brother it must be weighed against the constitutional
and civil liberties questions involved
     For example in some areas of the world torture is used as
an investigative tool by the local lawenforcement people  I
suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and
shortening many investigations  It probably also helps keep the
conviction rate high
     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country
even with a court order obtained by showing probable cause is
because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and
what is ethically and morally right
     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality
should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother  I
vote for morality
     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat
to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is
not put into wide spread use  After a quick reading of the White
House press release I came away with that impression
     To most of the American public the word hacker has
rightly or wrongly come to mean high tech adolescent vandal
It has struck me that most of the people posting to scicrypt
regarding this issue are intelligent thoughtful individuals who
have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues
surrounding Big Brother  I hope that the use of Big Brother does
not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal  I
would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead
Act
     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming
at us with the speed of an SST  The times they are a changing
and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same
way they have done it for the past  years maybe NSA should
evaluate another approach
     EFF who have correctly questioned the cryptographic
strength of Big Brother may need to send a stronger message out
regarding the constitutional issues involved
     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more
     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning En quoi cela

Clipper chip exchange keys  If the public key is only  or  bits long
does anyone know of any publickey schemes that are secure with that key
size  DiffieHellman or maybe El Gamal with p set to a constant value
   Presumably the real scheme is something like
 
     Exchangeverify public keys
     Send encrypted randomlygenerated session key
     Encrypt  Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher
 
   Can anyone elaborate on this or show me what I'm missing here

With all the talk about this Clipper chip I have developed one question

			HOW DOES IT WORK

If you use this then how does it get decrypted on the other end Does the
other party receiving the phone callmailetc have to know some code to 
undo it Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for 
another If the other party can decrypt it doesn't that mean that someone
else could also I assume that if everyone has a different key the only use
would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key This seems
like a fundamental question to me but I have very little experience with
cryptosystems other than DES If someone could give me an explanation as
to how it would be used remember that I have had little experience with
this sort of thing it would be very much appreciated

Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White
House Clipper chip crypto initiative  I think this is going to be a
tough measure to fight since the Government has invested a lot of
resources in developing this highprofile initiative  They are
serious about it now  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate
Bill  in 

Possible actions to take in response

  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list and
more

  Work the Press  Talk with your local newspaper's science and
technology reporter  Write to your favorite trade rags  Better yet
write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or
newspapers  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea 
Remember to tailor it to your audience  The general public may be
slow to grasp why it's a bad idea since it seems so technical and
arcane and innocent sounding  Try not to come across as a flaming
libertarian paranoid extremist even if you are one 

  Lobby Congress  Write letters and make phone calls to your
Member of Congress in your own district as well as your two US
Senators  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of
technology issues  Talk to those aides

  Involve your local political parties  The Libertarian party
would certainly be interested  There are also libertarian wings of
the Democrat and Republican parties  The right to privacy has a
surprisingly broad appeal spanning all parts of the political
spectrum  We have many natural allies  The ACLU  The NRA  Other
activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government
that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play
themselves out  But you must articulate our arguments well if you
want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues

  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF and
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility CPSR assuming
these groups will fight this initiative  They need money for legal
expenses and lobbying

  Mobilize opposition in industry  Companies that will presumably
develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be
lobbied against it from within and from without  If you work for a
telecommunications equipment vendor first enlist the aid of your
coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative and then
present your company's management with a united front of engineering
talent against this initiative  Write persuasive memos to your
management with your name and your colleagues' names on it  Hold
meetings on it

  Publicize deploy and entrench as much guerrilla
technomonkeywrenching apparatus as you can  That means PGP
anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP PGP key servers
etc  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might
also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed
by Government action  I will also be working to develop new useful
tools for these purposes 

  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on
this topic  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be so we
may have to compromise to get most of what we want  If we can't
outright defeat it we may have to live with a modified version of
this Clipper chip plan in the end  So we'd better be prepared to
analyze the Government's plan and articulate how we want it
modified

The cryptographic protocol though is another matter  I see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret and  as I hope I've shown above  there
are a lot of ways to do things that aren't quite as bad

It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret  If it were
published one could then build physically identical clone versions
of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips  But
the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses  Hmmn

Or is there a technical hack that I've missed  Eg how about if the
chips were made unprogrammed but serialized and then shipped to the
two escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys but
in a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses
be installed as well without which clone versions wouldn't
interoperate  This is getting awfully complicated but that's
crypto for you

Thus said djbsilvertonberkeleyedu D J Bernstein
Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says There is
a global key G plus one key UC for each chip C The user can choose a
new session key KP for each phone call P he makes Chip C knows three
keys G its own UC and the user's KP The government as a whole
knows G and every UC Apparently a message M is encrypted as
EGEUCKPC  EKPM That's it

The system as described here can't possibly work What happens when
someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip To get M
the receiving chip needs KP to get KP the receiving chip needs UC
The only information it can work with is C If UC can be computed
from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key
escrow'' is bullshit Otherwise how is a message decrypted

Given the description of the algorithm given the only plausible
explantion I can find is that KP must be agreed to out of bandwidth
in advance by the two parties ie it's a standard shared symmetric
key

	The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere I insert
my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom

	White House Announcement on Screw Thread Standards
	

	This is to announce that the American National Standards
Institute or whatever it is has been given the authority to define
standard dimensions for screw threads

   Look This is clearly the first step toward outlawing our
   own screw thread specifications If this madness isn't fought
   tooth and nail every step of the way it'll be a crime to use
   screw threads other than those our Fearless Leaders so graciously
   define for us

	The purpose of this is to permit industry to draw upon a standard
pool of specifications and designations to ensure interoperability of
various threaded objects across vendors

   Rubbish I say ANSI standard screw threads will have subtle weaknesses
   allowing their agents to disassemble our automobiles more easily
   causing our mufflers to fall off at inoppurtune moments

	Questions and Answers on the ANSI screw thread standards
	

Q Will the screw threads defined by ANSI be as good as other screw thread
designs available elsewhere

A Yes

	Hah trust us

Q Will I be able to use my own screw threads if I desire

A Of course but this will make your threaded objects unlikely to
interoperate correctly with others within the industry

	See See This is the first step

	It is clear we must band together write your congressman
Use Pretty Good Screw Threads not this devilinspired ANSI trash
Protect your constitutional right to use whatever screw thread you
desire Guerilla Screw Thread Activism must become the order of the
day Boycott GM and build your own car using screws from STZ

 a bunch of wellmeaning maybe cynnical text about screwthread
	sizes the rights of people to have their own standards
	and the nonright of the gov to regulate screwthreads

Well as funny as your little comment may seem it has very little to
do with your personal privacy as a citizen and about the governemnt
being able to look at everything you have ever typed into a computer
at one point or another

This Clipper Chip stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the 
Nightmare on Elmstreet cheeseoncelluloid movies look like episodes
of Mr Roger's Neighborhood

IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by
everyone and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments
and stored at two separate albeit easy to find places and that key is
only  bits to begin with we are screwed pardon the allusion to the 
afforementioned article

the gov I believe as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
for this Clipper Chip made  Hell they probably based the encoder on the 
chip that cracks it that way it's easier to break the code but since it is a 
classified algorythm no one knows that they can crack it so easily

I for one and quite scared of this kind of thing and plan to support 
organizations and even disorganizations who are fighting against this
Clipper Chip in any way that I can

I do not want the government to be able to have access even with a search
warrant to my keys and I don't want those keys to be only  bits long
to begin with

What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
flames please  It comes out of a background of  years as a senior
corporate staff executive in two Fortune  companies

I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big  accounting firms

I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap
doorsI'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
Swiss or anybody Japanese

A lot of us out here in the hinderland will trust the Japanese
before we'll trust the NSA the President or those stupid
Fortune  companies you're so proud of

This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would
feel the same way Mostmanysome pick one corporations have an attitude
that the NSA is part of our government and we support our government as
one very famous CEO put it to me one day

Just some perspective from another point of view

And since the Japanese corps aren't part of our governmentgovernors
they may be more trusted out htere than you are

I envision incorporation of new standart into
various communication systems thus making it prevalent on the market  
therefore cheap The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from 
communication equipment It seems logical to provide Clipper chip 
to the enduser not as a part of phone fax modem  like but in the
form of smartcard compatible with various telecomm products Banks 
will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone
Natural step will be to crossreference this card to the person in the 
government databases  or else this new version of wiretap proposal 
make no sence at all one wish to eavesdrop spell on the particular 
person not on the particular modem or phone
 
As a side note I disagree with one poster who said he won't care about
ability of the government to eavesdrop since they can do that now 
anyway Clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens 
making it monopoly of the government May be we can find examples when
interceptions made by unauthorised people uncovered crimes of 
state officials

It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals
are coming true  If the government continues on this course I imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal  Encryption programs
for disk files and email as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications will be distributed only through the
underground  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy

Some thoughts

Has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside nonencrypted
data files  Many file formats can be written with gaps in them to hide
other data  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden
by dispersing it amongst the legitimate data  The hidden data would only
show up with the right keys and a file with hidden data would be
indistinguishable from one without  So only the correct keys would reveal
the presence of an illegal document

If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have
the uncompressor and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish do I
have the right to transmit the file  Will we have to escrow all our data
file formats  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals colors and
catch phrases

I think that it's important to evaluate the content of electronic speach by
replacing the media with pen and paper or verbal speach and then reask the
question

   Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access  The
   telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant  That's the rule today

   But even so the evidence would not be admissible I think unless the
   judge so ordered  I think that even interception of the crypttext
   without a warrant would be illegal   Cops can't record today's plain
   cellular calls and then ask a judge Hey can we have permission to
   listen to those tapes can they

How long do you think it will be before it becomes legal for the
police to record encrypted conversations It's not violating your
privacy because we can't read the encryption without a warrant with the usual
goodfaith exception if they accidentally record a nonencrypted conversation

Besides it's covered by the Drug Exception to the Fourth Amendment

This is a very curious thing to say STUIIIs NSAdesigned secure

available to law enforcement agencies Word has it they're standard in
every FBI office for example  Something like several hundred

So why does the DoJ need to buy new phones that unlike STUIIIs will
not be certified for classified traffic and in all likelihood will
not be compatible with existing STUIIIs

Unless of course they're gearing up for large scale decryption of
civilian Clipper users and they need compatible hardware

dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the
effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police Actually reading
between the lines it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one
respect since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and
local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally

There has been extensive discussion in the eff forum for example about
inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to
admissible evidence  This might put a stop to such things which must from
time to time be simple fishing expeditions

The only information it can work with is C If UC can be computed
from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key

The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the
key management aspects  Either the KP is the secret key corresponding
to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation or it is the
result of a DiffieHellman key exchange or something similar  Either
way there must be some protocols beyond those described here  It isn't
clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must

Via KP of course  Nothing was said about where KP comes from  It's

What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
flames please  It comes out of a background of  years as a senior
corporate staff executive in two Fortune  companies

I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big  accounting firms
 
   I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders
It's understandablemost corporate execs don't know much about cryptology
and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil  And the
proposed scheme is a major improvement in telephone security to what
exists now
 
   The problem is that with any security scheme of this kind you have to
concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain  I suspect that NSA
has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs
probably at least as strong as say DES in OFBmode  Unfortunately the
existence of the keyregistry system seems to make possible all kinds of
possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build say
a DES keysearch machine
 
   As originally described it sounded like any police  court combination
could acquire the key for a given chip  I hope that's not the case since
it would imply a glaring hole  How much does it cost to find one crooked
jodge and one crooked cop  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency
or organized crime boss  However even if more intelligent schemes are used
to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations there will be weak
nesses  They may be very expensive and very difficult  But who would
trust hisher confidential information to an encryption scheme that for
say  could by cracked one time in a hundred  DES for all the
complaints about a bit key would probably cost several million dollars
to build a keysearch machine for
 
   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of
the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan Chrysler or Audi  How about
home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers
Gee Mr Jones I understand you've had some financial problems lately
Maybe I can help
 
I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
Swiss or anybody Japanese
 
   Indeed if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure it's very likely
as secure as IDEA or key DES  However the system as a whole isn't resistant
to practical cryptanalysis  In The Puzzle Palace Bamford describes how
several NSA employees were turned by foreign presumably KGB agents despite
security measures that I doubt any Big  accounting firm could match  And
NSA confidential data was not subject to being requested by thousands of
police organizations and courts across the land

It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret  If it were
published one could then build physically identical clone versions
of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips  But
the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses  Hmmn

								Yeah

	The algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar
government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary
design that the Feds say that NSA developed  Is there a patent  Is that
patent publicly available  My betting is that that too is classified

	If the algorithm were made public or reverseengineered it would
compromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip
users cyptodata but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker

	Wouldn't that just be too bad

The cryptographic algorythm MUST be kept secret or
private individuals could make ClipperClones with
which they could transmit messages which the feds would not have
ready access to
 
   Not necessarily  I've been thinking about this and if this chipscheme
is to provide any real security there must be some sort of key exchange
either using a publickey encryption scheme or using a key exchange scheme
like DiffieHellman  If there's an outofband transmission of a shared
session key then what protects that band from eavesdropping  If the phone
company or some other online central authority generates a session key and
sends it to both users then what's the point of going to the trouble of
having some complicated keydepositories  Just ask the phone company for
a copy of the session key for each call
 
   Now it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of
every public key used by anyone anywhere right  So probably there will
be some way of getting these keys verified  This might be a digitally
signed by the chip manufacturer copy of the public key in this unit
stored by this unit  It might also be an online directory with access to
everyone's public keys  This would introduce another weakness to the
security of the scheme of course  Presumably if you don't use your
designated key you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips
 
   It might be useful to have a modified chip which would allow you to
use either the original publicprivate key pair or some other key pair
and verification scheme  Unfortunately this would not allow you to call
most people and establish secure communications

The greatest danger of the escrow database if it were kept on disk

Of course then it's hard to backup  However I think the consequences

than the consequences of a secret backup

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes you effectively have

no crypto  Thus this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better

   Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the US
government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative
For example how about a scheme using RSA and some hybrid of DESCFB and
another strong stream cipher Maybe IDEACFB  This could be substantially
the same as the cripple chip except that instead of keyregistration the
police could demand that you give up your secret key to them with a court
issued warrant  Then they could read the last few months of wiretapped
messages you've sent and assuming you've committed no crimes you could
generate a new key pair and go about your business  I find that I'd be
willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system especially given the
alternative  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key then you'd
probably stay in jail has anyone got a real legal precedent for this
   This would allow courtissued warrants to be used to gather information
on suspected criminals but it couldn't be done in secrecy and there
would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys
Maybe someone from the lawenforcement or intelligent community will correct
me but this doesn't seem like such a big loss in terms of lawenforcement
capabilities

I think your ideas are well taken and constructive  Thanks for
articulating them in this forum

  Work the Press  Talk with your local newspaper's science and
technology reporter  Write to your favorite trade rags  Better yet
write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or
newspapers  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea 
Remember to tailor it to your audience  The general public may be
slow to grasp why it's a bad idea since it seems so technical and
arcane and innocent sounding  Try not to come across as a flaming
libertarian paranoid extremist even if you are one 

As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist  I'at a loss for
specific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical  Any
suggestions  Perhaps somebody could post a list of these

  Mobilize opposition in industry  Companies that will presumably
develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be
lobbied against it from within and from without  If you work for a
telecommunications equipment vendor first enlist the aid of your
coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative and then
present your company's management with a united front of engineering
talent against this initiative  Write persuasive memos to your
management with your name and your colleagues' names on it  Hold
meetings on it
 
One way to do this might be to suggest that these companies should be
implementing their own schemes not being limited to the govt's
scheme

I find that most of my reasons for opposition to the CLipper scheme
are algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govtNSA  These are hard 
to sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people  Any
hints or advice  Maybe a small FAQtype thing Why should I Hate
Clipper would be a good idea

	Also how about a box that you plug your phone into which would allow

	digitizing input speech transmitting and decrypting on the other end  I 
	don't know how a publickey system could work in this regard but it might 
	

	heh heh I posted this just before reading all the Clinton Chip messages
	I guess they beat me to it  Anyway I think it would be a great idea to
	develop such a product perhaps in the underground as it would otherwise
	probably become illegal pretty quickly here

It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive  all that's needed
is a box with a phone jack on one side a DSP in the middle to do codec
functions of speechcompressed bytestream and an RS on the other side

You'd plug your phone into it plug the RS into your computer and have
a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS port  The CPU in the
middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on
a byte stream

With vbis or better modems to carry the bytestream it should work 
Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone

At the very highest price you could use one of those voicemail compatible
modems to do the digitisation  that puts an upper bound of about  on
the cost of such a box  In practice you really ought to be able to get
the price well below   I could do it now in software on my cheapnasty
home RISC box Acorn Archimedes with the digitising microphone I bought
for  pounds if I knew how to write good speech compression software
which I don't

The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one 
the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip
Economics I'm afraid

However we can get about Kcps throughput on the internet even with
the bottleneck of a vbis modem  When we get ISDN for all ha ha ha
and the new NREN it might then be trivial to run compressed speech
over a tcpip connection on the Internet  Perhaps we should start
thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible
for everyone and sidestep the clipper stuff and use internet for
all our phone calls in future    joking

April  

INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL

ESCROW

The bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom
hold bits of each key  The manufacturer of the communications device
would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow
agents  A key is tied to the device however not the person using it

So if we subvert one of the two escrow agents we only have a bit
space to search through

 doesn't sound that big  is digital telephony subject to a known
plaintext attack

In which case half the key seems to be all that is needed and the two
agent escrow arrangement is pointless 

Of course the unknown algorithm might turn gaps in speech into 
pseudorandom sequences or there might be some magic involved or

stuff deleted
existence of the keyregistry system seems to make possible all kinds of
possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build say
a DES keysearch machine
 
   As originally described it sounded like any police  court combination
could acquire the key for a given chip  I hope that's not the case since
it would imply a glaring hole  How much does it cost to find one crooked
jodge and one crooked cop  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency
or organized crime boss  However even if more intelligent schemes are used
to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations there will be weak
nesses  They may be very expensive and very difficult  But who would
trust hisher confidential information to an encryption scheme that for
say  could by cracked one time in a hundred  DES for all the
complaints about a bit key would probably cost several million dollars
to build a keysearch machine for
 

I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx K but
it is not sold by that name Go buy a circuit emulation machine eg Quickturn
containing a bunch of FPGAs say  to  's and program each
to be a DES search engine Lets say  chips running at Mhz  G testssec
Time is e sec max   weeks  weeks average Can't wait that long
Buy a bigger machine

	Not to pick on Mr May in particular of course but isn't this
kind of the domino theory When one little country falls its neighbor

in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas
Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams who I believe is a
professor at Georgetown I wonder if he knows of Dorothy you're not in
Kansas anymore Denning  The article was titled Government slowly
eroding our liberties and in it he tells a story attributed to the
late Leonard Read who

        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from
        Americans you had to know how to cook a frog  Mr Read
        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and
        then throwing the frog in  His reflexes are so quick that
        as soon as his feet touch the water he will leap away
        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it
        up bit by bit  By the time the frog realizes he's being
        cooked it is too late  It is the same with Americans
        If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once we
        would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant  But as
        with successful frog cooking our liberties can be taken
        a little bit at a time

The last line of the article says It's not too late for us but the
water is getting pretty warm  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the
Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course

 Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
 one Make it voluntary

As usually you are not reading The proposal does say that it is a
voluntary program This doesn't make it more desirable though

 That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
 to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

Secure How do you know Because NSA is trying to make you believe it
Trust us Yeah right

Otherwise you are on your own How do you know that tomorrow they
will not outlaw encrypring devices that don't use their technology
Because they are promising you Gee they are not doing even that 
read the proposal again

 What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
 flames please 

It is incompetent like almost anything you have posted here so
you'll be flamed sorry

 It comes out of a background of  years as a senior
 corporate staff executive in two Fortune  companies

 your  years of background in two Fortune  companies I've
lived  years under a totalitarian regime and boy I can recognize
a totalitarian plot when I see one

 I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
 they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to

I am sure that you would be happy to use anything they tell you is
secure we're talking about the intelligent people here Or the
criminal ones if you don't like the previous sentence  Or those
who don't want their privacy to be guaranteed to be invadable by the
government  any current and future government mind you

 I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
 the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
 satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big  accounting firms

Even if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment
and even if you are happy with such system and the current escrow
agencies NOW what guarantees that you'll be happy with them TOMORROW
when the government changes Or when the current government throws
away the sheep skin All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get
caught by surprise but it will be too late because then cryptography
that is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already
have been outlawed After all you've already got privacy that is
said to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies so if you
are lawabiding you have no reasons to use a stronger one right So
if you are using a stronger one you have something to hide from the
law enforcement agencies right Something unlawful right Therefore
strong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something
unlawful

 I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap

Considering the level of competence in cryptology that you have
demonstrated in your messages you would trust just anything And
no this is not an ad hominem attack it's an attack against the
contents of your messages grin

 doorsI'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
 the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

And how do you know that these experts are not corrupted And how do
you know that they will not make a mistake And how do you know that
the version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same
as the one that will be really used

Regarding the mistake  even the few information they have let out
has revealed a serious security hole in the protocol  the bit key
is split in two bit ones thus the whole system is easily
breakable if you have only one of the keys

 I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
 Swiss or anybody Japanese

The Swiss or the Japanese are motivated by simple greed NSA is
motivated by their wish to control the people That's why the drug
dealers have their accounts in Swiss banks instead of in American
ones For some reason they do trust the Swiss banks more Guess
they'll trust the Swiss encryption more too I see IDEA becoming
suddenly popular 

 This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would
 feel the same way Mostmanysome pick one corporations have an attitude
 that the NSA is part of our government and we support our government as
 one very famous CEO put it to me one day

It's not surprising at all but not because of the reason you give
It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of
money behind this program and it will support it Thus most
corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it
too The same good old greed Strong encryption is not widely
available now not because of some plot but because the companies
don't see much money in it It will be available even less if the
companies can see any penalties associated with it

 Just some perspective from another point of view

Yeah just as I predicted you are here again to support the new
system

 If the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by
 everyone and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments
 and stored at two separate albeit easy to find places and that key is
 only  bits to begin with we are screwed pardon the allusion to the 
 afforementioned article

 The gov I believe as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
 for this Clipper Chip made  Hell they probably based the encoder on the 
 chip that cracks it that way it's easier to break the code but since it is a 
 classified algorythm no one knows that they can crack it so easily

Agreed No agency such as the NSA or whoever would approve the public 
release of a cryptosystem if they didn't already have the technical
means or the knowhow to decrypt everything at their whim Surely the whole
point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that hisher
communications will be kept safe while James Bond at the NSA can if need
be have full decrypted access to someone's communications That'll be
quite a heist if they can pull it off 


I thought that the US Government were going to release the algorithm to a
panel of carefully chosen experts who would then study it deeply and
report their findings Exactly who will these people be Academics Or
Governmentsponsored researchers Tinytoons

 I for one and quite scared of this kind of thing and plan to support 
 organizations and even disorganizations who are fighting against this
 Clipper Chip in any way that I can

I can only hope that the same sort of thing doesn't start filtering over
into the ears of the UK Government and if the European Parliament gets
wind of it well we can kiss goodbye to any form of Democracy in Europe 
at all

 I do not want the government to be able to have access even with a search
 warrant to my keys and I don't want those keys to be only  bits long
 to begin with

 Though some may argue about the nose of the camel it's worth noting that
 the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony If it is only
 used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file

As usual David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read The
proposal clearly states

 The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
 accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
 telecommunications networks and wireless communications links

It speaks about telecommunications in general Read it again David
Maybe you'll understand it the next time Nah probably not

 encryption then it IS an improvement over the current massproduced
 standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to
 easytobreak inverters

That's exactly what the government wants all sheepminded people to
think Let's look at the current situation It allows to almost
anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unless secure and I mean
secure encryption is used What will happen when if Ha
optimists the new proposal gets accepted Almost nobody EXCEPT
SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of
these some to eavesdrop will be guaranteed The proposal emphasizes
on the former almost nobody  which is clearly an improvement 
and forgets to mention the drawbacks of the latter guaranteed
Yes my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the
strong crypto unlawful You think that it will not happen Good luck

 Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap

It's not just continued ability It's guaranteed ability

 Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
 email and files let's focus on this

Yeah that's exactly what your government wants you to think Let's
take small steps one at a time Concentrate on the current one don't
think about the future Trust us

 One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
 limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it

It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the
intention They unlike you read what they write

 Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some I find the proposal
 less threatening than many others since right now most Americans have no
 secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can
 eavesdrop This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and
 cordless phones

Yes it will It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now It will
allow only to the government to eavesdrop If the scheme is secure
of course which is yet to be proven But how do you know that the
jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow The
new proposal guarantees him the ability to eavesdrop then Hell
that will even motivate him to get that job  if he indeed is that
mentally pervert

 Reading between the lines I infer that the system is highly secure
 without access to the keys

Great The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight tm
has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any
details whatsoever and has concluded that it is highly secure I
guess that comes from the background of working some  years for the
two major crypto evaluating companies right Gee now the government
can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto
experts to secretly analyse the new secret method  for David
Sternlight has already done all the job for them

 This would meet the needs of US businesses
 confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including French and Japanese
 security services and rich Japanese companies It allows the NSA to make
 available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs

Trust us we're from the Government and we're here to help you

 Most legitimate US corporations trust the NSA and would be delighted to
 have a highsecurity system certified by them even at the price of
 depositing keys in escrow I see no difficulty in creating a reliable

Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of
future safety do not deserve either This or something like that I
don't have the exact quote but the meaning is the same has been said
by one of your great men Maybe you should study their works more
carefully if you have the brains to understand them of course

 From my point of view this is a fair starting point There are concerns that
 need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows But in

The main question is to guarantee to availability of really secure
cryptography to the masses Gee if the proposal was saying we
guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use
any kind of encryption she would like and regard this proposal as
just a default voluntary implementation there would have been much
less opposition For some reason they didn't even try to promise
you that I wonder why Was Orwell off only by  years

 return we get access to highsecurity crypto

No in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled

 Many have suggested that DES
 and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly
 skilled and endowed

While the above is just rumors and while even if it is true it is
not done easily the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily
breakable by anybody who has the two keys It might be also breakable
by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick Or who
has only one of them NSA also told you that DES is secure why don't
you simply trust them huh

 There is at least a good possibility which should be
 checked that the proposed system is not so breakable It doesn't have to

It is guaranteed to be easily breakable  just get the keys It
might be even easier but until there is some evidence this is just a
wild speculation

 be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys

The trapdoors are there In government's hands The keys

 pursuant to a legitimate court order Thus they can protect legitimate
 communications against economic adversaries while still being able to
 eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order

Legitimate And who decides what communications are legitimate Oh I
guess it's the government right The guys who already have the keys
It's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide
who has the right to use it legitimately

 In discussing this let's try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and
 noise of some previous threads

Impossible since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence
and ignorance as in the provious threads

 This is a substantive and technical issue
 and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion

Unfortunately I have yet to see you posting a technically competent
message

Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note courtesy of

Two requests  first note the roles of S and S  It appears to me
and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit
key  And the nature of the generation process for K and K is such
that neither can be produced alone  Thus the scheme cannot be
implemented such that one repository generates the first halfkey and
another generates the second  That is ominous

Second  these postings are not revealed scripture nor are they
carefullycrafted spook postings  Don't attempt to draw out hidden
meanings as opposed to say the official announcements of Clipper
Leave Denning out of this given Hellman's record of opposition to DES
which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read I
don't think you can impugn his integrity

Oh yeah  the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid  If you think

Subject Re  Clipper Chip
To a long list of folks

I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI so let me add a few comments to
Marty's message

        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 

The algorithm operates on bit blocks like DES and the chip supports
all  DES modes of operation  The algorithm uses  rounds of scrambling
compared with  in DES

	In addition to the system key each user will get to choose his 
	or her own key and change it as often as desired Call this key 
	plain old K When a message is to be sent it will first be 

K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver  Any method
eg public key can be used to establish the session key  In the
ATT telephone security devices which will have the new chip the key
is negotiated using a publickey protocol
 
	encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK 
	and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
	message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
	producing

	     E EM K EK UK serial number  SK

My understanding is that EM K is not encrypted under SK called the
family key and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
law enforcement  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this  I
will also check it out but this is am Sunday so I did not want to wait

        The unit key 
	will be generated as the XOR of two bit random numbers K 
	and K UKKK which will be kept by the two escrow 

The unit key also called the chip key is generated from the
serial number N as follows  Let N N and N be  bit blocks
derived from N and let S and S be two bit seeds used as keys
Compute the bit block 

        R  EDEN S S S 

Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
two keys  Similarly compute blocks R and R starting with N and N
I'm unlear about whether the keys S and S change  The fact that
they're called seeds suggests they might  Then R R and R are
concatenated together giving  bits  The first  bits  form K and
the next  bits form K  The remaining bits are discarded

	authorities Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be 
	decided by the Attorney General but it was stressed to me that 
	they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies that they 
	must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased 

Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions
Please pass them to me along with your reasons  In addition to Marty's
criteria I would add that the agencies must have an established record
of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information  Some suggestions
I've received so far include SRI Rand Mitre the national labs Sandia
LANL Los Alamos Treasury GAO

	When a court order obtains K and K and thence K the law 
	enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information 
	flowing on the suspected link Aside It is my guess that 
	they may do this constantly on all links with or without a 
	court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links 
	over which a message will flow 

My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it
will be operated by the FBI  The service provider will isolate the
communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through
the decode box which will have been keyed with K

        No single person or authority should have the power to
        authorize wiretaps

No single person does at least for FBI taps  After completing a mound
of paperwork an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain
that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the
Attorney General for final approval

 dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the
 effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police Actually reading
 between the lines it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one
 respect since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and
 local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally

Instead of reading between the lines try to think a little bit OK
if that's way too difficult to you here are some hints

Indeed the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone So guess what they will
do Propose that the new technology is removed Or implement some
facilitations Of course you won't want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters because meanwhile those two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child right So
there should be some way for them to get access to those keys
quickly right Like they could have a copy of the database and
worry about a warrant later

It is at

The ps suffixed files are the optional postscript docs 
a reasonably good research report with benchmarks is

Note for Macintosh MPW users after a few hours of drudgery
I ported the tool to MPW  running under System 
If you would like me to email a binhexed copy of the tool
suitable for dropping in to your MPWtools folder please write

Other than the more purely cryptographic uses for the tool
I've been having lots of fun picking up the lost
references to things I'm interested in For example
starting a search like

agrep  i 'Burning Chrome' cyberpunkspool 

immediately finds references like 'burning crome' that I
have always missed before  See how many times John
Gilmore's name is mentioned in the CUD archives
and how often misspelled  How about your name

As usual I will email the uuencoded tarZ upon request
if you cannot do anonymous FTP

  Misinterpretation though it should be a crime in itself is what
United States lawyers use to make their bread and butter

  In Manchester CT a few years ago a small company wanted to run a
game system galled LaserGames similar in many aspects to Photon
tm Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law
in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to
prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival
which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious Among these
things was shooting galleries which is what the lawyers for the
opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon The judge took the two
words from this law completely out of context and ruled that
LaserGames could not operate in Manchester

  Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in
their shooting galleries and not light beams Clearly from context
LaserGames got shafted but if the two words are applied their denial
of operating permission was justified

  If I had the text of the law I'd post it but I'm afraid I don't
remember it all well enough to even try That little bit with the two
words stuck well though

Subject  REPORT ON PRIVACYPROTECTING OFFLINE CASH AVAILABLE 
MessageID charoncwinl

I recently published a new privacyprotecting offline electronic cash
system as a technical report at CWI Being a PhDstudent at David
Chaum's cryptographygroup our group has a long history in research
in the field of privacyprotecting cash systems

The report is called CSRpsZ contains  pages and can be
retrieved from

ftpcwinl   

from the directory pubCWIreportsAA
The postscriptfile is suitable for dpi laserprinters


ABSTRACT from coverpage We present a new offline electronic cash
system based on a problem called the representation problem of which
little use has been made in literature thus far Our system is the
first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms  Using the
representation problem as a basic concept some techniques are
introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and
payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier
systems As a consequence our cash system is much more efficient in
both computation and communication complexity than any such system
proposed previously
  
Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability
Contrary to previously proposed systems its correctness can be
mathematically proven to a very great extent Specifically if we
make one plausible assumption concerning a single hashfunction the
ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the
DiffieHellman problem 
  
Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in
previously known systems In our opinion the most interesting of these
is that the entire cash system including all the extensions can be
incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers which has
the important advantage that doublespending can be prevented in the
first place rather than detecting the identity of a doublespender
after the fact In particular it can be incorporated even under the
most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user
which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems
Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have
negligible probability of success independent of computing power by
a simple mechanism from within the system which is something that
previous solutions lack entirely Furthermore the basic cash system
can be extended to checks multishow cash and divisibility while
retaining its computational efficiency


Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system  

I made a particular effort to keep the report as selfcontained as
possible  Nevertheless if you have any questions please email to
me and I will try to reply as good as I can Any comments are also
welcome

I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on

right that the clipper list was just someone's idea of a bad joke  I
guess I should be happy it wasn't a conspiracy

I have also been in contact with Mitch about this I believe
him when he says he didn't ask to be on the clipper list

He also forwarded the traffic he had recieved through that list to
me which will be placed at some ftp site

However the first alias on the clipper list was csspab which was
another mailing list It basically contained the addresses for
staffers and board members of the NIST security board Several of
these people had their accounts within the dockmaster domain

These are the people we might wish to FOIA

 The answer seems obvious to me they wouldn't  There is other hardware

 How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of

 the clipper system the only crypto available in the US

It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret  If it were
published one could then build physically identical clone versions
of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips  But
the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses  Hmmn

Not necessarily  they could release the details of the algorithm
without releasing the system key called SK by Hellman  That would
make most people happy and with some sort of verification procedure
before key exchange the official chips would only work with other
official chips  In other words secrecy of SK makes physically
identical clone versions impossible  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't
be necessary

Of course revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK 
since all units share this key compromising it may be a big deal
Personally I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one secret
bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security
Of course compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system
is compromised but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true
with a secret algorithm

Incidentally what's to keep a secret algorithm from using the secret
SK as the main key with UK being only marginally important  Then
a court order for UK may not even be necessary to do a wiretap

 on my calls My opinions are the sort that would get me 
 disappeared in a slightly less free society  and who knows what 
 sort of society we will be in in five or ten years I have friends who 
 have had their phones tapped  none of this is theoretical to me 

I understand believe it or not and there are any number of kinds of 
conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider 
using this scheme for  On the other hand I don't see Clipper as providing 
a secure channelit just prevents casual eavesdropping  This is part of why 
I am not worried about it per se  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious 
security tool is simply ludicrous  It's a voice scrambler nothing more

There is still plenty of market for real crypto

 As for its better than the status quo well first of all you can 
 get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today  and they work 
 well

They cost an arm and a leg though Clipper is obviously aimed at the mass 
market  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business

 In addition a number of groups are now working on building 
 software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now  and 
 they are all working in overdrive mode 

This is old news  I can do this now

 There ARE no crypto restrictions yet You can use anything you want 
 RIGHT NOW The point is to maintain that right 

There ARE restrictions  Example We're a networking software vendor with a 
large overseas share of our market  We cannot currently ship PEM or even 
simple DES in our products without casebycase approval from the Department 
of State  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to 
compete in international information systems markets

Sure you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in 
the USA  I on the other hand want strong crypto PKCS for example to be 
the default for electronic mail worldwide  I want priests to be able to 
hear confession over email  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in 
confidence over email or doctors talk with patients  I want to be able to 
order products from my favorite Japanese mailorder catalog over the net  I 
want to be able to sign contracts transact business and so on 
electronically

This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on 
crytographic systems especially beyond the borders of the USA

Clipper is irrelevant and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe 
all the better  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put 
more restrictions into place on the theory that it is good enough for 
anyone who has nothing to hide  That argument is of course utter BS just 
as much as no one needs an assault rifle

 Below is my response to Dr Denning's letter to Steven Bellovin Comments
  are invited  Paul 

In altprivacyclipper Steve Bellovin posted your message to
him which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies
as escrow agencies

I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow
agencies won't be law enforcement agencies I would argue however
that one of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all

As a private citizen I would feel much more secure in my person and
papers knowing that an organization committed to individual civil
liberties the ACLU and the NRA come to mind was safeguarding half of
my key Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure
by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported funded or
overtly controlled by the government

Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you
mentioned I have the following comments

	 SRI Rand Mitre and national labs I agree that they have
        great experience safeguarding sensitive information I am not
        convinced that they would adequately safeguard this
	information since in any case requiring disclosure there's
      	likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure possibly
 	wrongful disclosure

	 GAO perhaps I would like to see more concrete evidence of
 	their fidelity and ability

	 TREASURY Surely you're joking Perhaps you'd ask BATF
	to safeguard keys Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a 
	better choice

Ever since last fall's trial balloon was posted in scicrypt your
name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in
the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law

I agree with you in part those agencies and agents almost always
act properly However there have been enough cases where sworn
agents of the Federal Government have acted wrongly to make me feel
that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable

Subject Re  Clipper Chip

I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features
of Clipper  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages
on Clipper

The name of the encryption algorithm is Skipjack

Martin Hellman had written

                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part
                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK
                producing

                     E EM K EK UK serial number  SK

To which I responded

        My understanding is that EM K is not encrypted under SK called the
        family key and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
        law enforcement  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this

I was correct in that EM K is not encrypted under SK  However Skipjack
being a singlekey system there is of course not a separate decrypt key
for the family key SK

        The unit key also called the chip key is generated from the
        serial number N as follows  Let N N and N be  bit blocks
        derived from N and let S and S be two bit seeds used as keys
        Compute the bit block

                R  EDEN S S S

        Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
        two keys  Similarly compute blocks R and R starting with N and N
        I'm unlear about whether the keys S and S change  The fact that
        they're called seeds suggests they might  Then R R and R are
        concatenated together giving  bits  The first  bits  form K and
        the next  bits form K  The remaining bits are discarded

The seeds S and S do not change   The whole process is performed on
a laptop computer and S and S are supplied by two independent people
so that no one person knows both  The same S and S are used during
an entire programming session to generate keys for a stream of serial
numbers  Everything is discarded at the end the computer could be
thrown out if desired

The serial number is  bits and the values N N and N are formed
by padding the serial number with fixed bit blocks separate padding
for each value

The resulting keys K and K are output onto separate floppy disks paired
up with their serial number  Each pair is stored in a separate file  The
floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two
escrow agencies

I am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by
Please remark that in posting this I do not automatically agree
with it's contents and implications So don't swamp my mailbox 

I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical
discussion that is rising here And no I don't mind if you call
S and S 'backdoor' as I could imagine the keygeneration process
working without these seeds and the dependency of KK from the
SerialNumber

  the clipper system the only crypto available in the US 
 
 The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind  
 

I think i heard someplace misclegal comporgefftalk that the courts
have pretty much eliminated the fourth amendment already

You can find the salient difference in any number of th amendment
related Supreme Court opinions The Court limits th amendment
protections to what they call testimonial evidence as opposed to
physical evidence

The whole question would hinge on whether a crypto key would be
considered testimonial evidence I suppose arguments could be made
either way though obviously I would hope it would be considered

If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of Clipper Chip key halves
I would not trust Mitre either  Mitre does lots of work for NSA at least
in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program evaluation of commercial off the
shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information and
I assume in other less open programs

There are at least two other FFRDCs Federally Funded Research and Development
Corporations that work for NSA Aerospace Corporation and the Institute for
Defense Analysis  Now if NSA were to be untrustworthy a position that I
am neutral about for purposes of this posting it would be in a position to
exert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand  It could
just say If you don't cooperate with us we'll place all our evaluation
contracts with Aerospace and IDA

I am not saying that people at NSA Mitre Aerospace or IDA are dishonest
folk  But since they are people and people occasionally go bad the
system works better if organizations that you are depending upon to be
independent really are

And of course I speak for myself not my employer

Hmm followup on my own posting Well who cares

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the
ClipperChip from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us

The chip itself is not confined to digital telephony but performs
general encryption in a symmetric manner  The chip supports CFB OFB
ECB and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is the algorithm
consists of  rounds of whatever and takes Bit keys Input data
seems to be  Bit Yes
So if two people want secure communication whatever that means when 
Clipper is involved they have first to agree on ONE secret key 
Or is it one key per direction 
They can exchange this key via DHschemes or however
Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipperchip
which is now ready to work
The clipper chip carries an unique SerialNumber  Bit's and  KeyBits
These  keybits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serialnumber
with  seedbits The seedbits seem not to be stored in the chip
At beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin
before sending the fist real bit output of the first encryption the Clipper
chip put's out packets I guess  which represent the serial number
and the session key This might look like
X EK chipkeyKK serial number
where X is a transformation of these  Packets involving a familykey
This familyspkey is equal for ALL chips X might be a simple XOR 
After that the digital phonecall can be done as usual every packet
being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper

Denning describes how K and K shall be generated using a seed of 
Bit's

Now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you not
being an American Citicientm     there are some weak points in this
scheme which might be exploited by several parties

As far as I know about the generation of KK  S and S look like the 
obvious backdoor They could be used to generate the chipkeys by knowing
the serialnumber and also the familykey of the chip I really can't
imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true randomsources
for the generation of the KK can be bought for not to much money

Then the escrows Each of them will get  bit of a Bit key Security
could as little as existant be maximized by giving them bits
each which have to be xored together to give the KK Now let's simply
assume the escrows are trustworthy and can't be fooled by criminals or
law enforchemnt agencies And there will be no quarrel between escrows
and lea which would hinder the lea in doing their duties and so on
and so on Once the keys are surrendered the corresponding
chip is compromised forever Not very clever IMHO   
How about sending in the encrypted sessionkeys for each phonecall that
the police or whoever want's to listen to Escrows could then simply decode
this sessionkey and send it back to police And would naturally not do this
after the warrant has expired This would be a better technical solution
but I guess politics will not work that way

Apparently as Miss Dennings stated the only one performing actually decodes
of intercepted messages shall be the FBI Great So local guys can not inter
cept understand your traffic anymore Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes
the right to do legal wiretaps  How is law over there I have no idea who
is allowed to tap and who not This certainly means that watched communi
cations will be routed automatically from the serviceproviding company
to the FBI if the communicaiton is a watched one And this means as far
as I understand it that the familykey has to be known by each switching
company and those providing cellularphone servies etcetc So the familykey
will not be very secret and thus serialnumbers of calls will be readable
by anybody who cares I like trafficanalysis

What do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ECB mode and the
first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled So the session
key would not be actually broadcasted over the line Hmmm Shouldn't be so
difficult to do that 

And now a last point for the other side After all I have read and heard about
Clipper not the programming language for dBase is it   it seems
to have many advantages which shold not be overseen


Now an afterthought to your rights Please note that I have no idea what I am
talking about

From gradynetcomcom EF
    Amendment                                                            
                                                                          
    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech
or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to 
petition the Government for a redress of grievances

If this text is actually in your Bill of Rights who can overrule this 
But 'Freedom of speech' is not 'Secrecy of speech'

Maybe you need to extend your Amendment   to cover information and
communication too 

I am not very sure in what position your government actually is legally
when it tries to ban cryptography and arms Amendment say you may have them
but not under what conditions Hmm tricky situation 

Actually it will make not much sense to discuss that topic in scicrypt
Discussion of technical details and vulnerabilites of the system are highly
suggested and appreciated 

Friendly greetings

Talk about adding insult to injury  
 
I for one believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration not continued  Instead it looks like that
illgotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment

I wholeheartedly agree  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies
seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that
we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELFGOVERNANCE  WE have
to take our government back from the selfserving politicians who create laws
and rules only to better their positions within the government  WE have allowed
them to take too much power from the people of this nation  That situation has
to be changed

Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to payoff drug
informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
with the Devil himself  It's a vicious cycle  The law enforcement agencies are
motivated to seize property to fund their own activities  And having no easy
way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
incentive for the agencies to take property

It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that
Clinton would have the plumbers out in force shortly  Clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control  Anytime a
leader believes in that the leader will use every means possible to retain that
control and take more

WE have to take OUR government back  Otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a hightech third world dictatorship  We have to take
responsibility for ourselves our personal welfare and our actions

                   Office of the Press Secretary
 
 
 
 For Immediate Release                           April  
 
 
                 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY
 
 
 The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
 the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
                                                     
Hum ATT VLSI and Mykotronx are 'industry'
Wonder what happened to IBM this should be right up their street
And a mandateed scheme is voluntary Mr Orwell would love this

 program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
                                                 
 communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
 enforcement

Telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like RSA
IDEA or even DES The above while literaly true is a clasic strawman claim
in the context of nonrealtime circuits such as Email and the like

 The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
 accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
 telecommunications networks and wireless communications links
 

I would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun
ications than this lot

 For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
 private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
 tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
 protecting Americans  Rather than use technology to accommodate
 the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and
 law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against
 industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement
 
 Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
 protect electronic funds transfer  It is now being used to
 protect electronic mail and computer files  While encryption

Normmaly DES

 technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
                                        
 unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
 by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

Note the use of the word business in the above The whole tenor of this
release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only business use
is legitimate for debate If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's
ear to remain secret and private that is not even on the agenda for debate
Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this The only
reference is to information already in the hands of others The 'unauthorized
release' bit is also drawing a long bow Most of these cases are by people who
have legitimate access abusing it and revealing or often selling the info
These people are of course in this proposal the people who will have the
keys

The criminals also use lawers courts the CIA whitehouse officials and pens
to go about their business When will they be outlawed as well Yeah several
of them would be a better idea than CLipper

Them again the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded
over the last decade ofr so

 A stateoftheart microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has
 been developed by government engineers  The chip represents a
                    
NSA

 new approach to encryption technology

Yeah this bit is VERY true

It can be used in new
 relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
 an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications
 using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
 commercial use today
 

Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption A demo
of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment
I suspect Note also the 'many' not 'all' as the general tone implies

 This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
                                
 information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
                                      
 and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
 electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the
 ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
 intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening
of the current abuses I have not heard yet of a case that was impeaded by
the use of secure encryption by the men in black The other side abuse by law
enforcers is well documented even by govt agencies And the phone vs other coms
is blurred yet again


















 A keyescrow system will be established to ensure that the
 Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of lawabiding
 Americans















 A keyescrow system will be established to ensure that the
 Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of lawabiding
 Americans

Lets run that line twice Not VERY carefully what it says The stated
purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory Note the
word ensure As to 'protect' or 'lawabiding' I will leave to you
So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions
the answer in this press release is YES

 Each device containing the chip will have two unique
 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government
 agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the
 device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately
 in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the
 Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to
 government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
 wiretap

Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent 

 The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no
 new authorities to access the content of the private
 conversations of Americans

Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved

 To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the
 Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
 devices  In addition respected experts from outside the
 government will be offered access to the confidential details of
 the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
 their findings

Where do you find many experts Any ex KGB people looking for a contract 
And as a later posting asks what of the STUIIIs they already have It will
be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it
After all it is secure isn't it The govt will answer that point by its own
actions

 The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
 encryption's dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
 privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
 criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
 approaches that can both provide lawabiding citizens with access
 to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
 to hide their illegal activities  In order to assess technology
 trends and explore new approaches like the keyescrow system
 the President has directed government agencies to develop a
 comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates
 
         the privacy of our citizens including the need to
           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes
                                                

Again personal use seems to be a unaskable question

 
         the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
           calls and data under proper court or other legal
                                                  
           order when necessary to protect our citizens

Ah so warrents are not always needed it seems

 
         the effective and timely use of the most modern
           technology to build the National Information
           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
           the competitiveness of American industry in the global
           marketplace and 
 
         the need of US companies to manufacture and export
           high technology products

The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this

 The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
 affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the
 privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed
 The Administration is committed to working with the private
 sector to spur the development of a National Information
 Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
 technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
 information  This infrastructure of highspeed networks
 information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV
 programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
 system transmits voice

Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret Only the 'proper people'
will be able to express an opinion hence only the desired result will emerge

 Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
 role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
 quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
 its use  The Administration is committed to policies that
 protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
 them from those who break the law

Encryption and codes have been around for millenia They are generaly in
equilibrium with the technology of the time The systematic study of cyphers
has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter AT THE MOMENT I have no
doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time Probably fofr practical
purposes by the middle of the next century

 Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet 
 The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
 encryption technology are also available

 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE
 
 
 
 
 Q   Does this approach expand the authority of government
      agencies to listen in on phone conversations
 
 A   No  Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with
      no new authorities to access the content of the private
      conversations of Americans
 
 Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
      encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
      decipher the message
 
 A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
      court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
      would then present documentation of this authorization to
      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
      smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
      escrow system
 
 Q   Who will run the keyescrow data banks
 
 A   The two keyescrow data banks will be run by two independent
      entities  At this point the Department of Justice and the
      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
      oversee the keyescrow data banks

It is a little hard to critisise a nonproposal

 Q   How strong is the security in the device  How can I be sure
      how strong the security is  
 
 A   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
      systems readily available today

Note we drop back to 'phonemode' again If this is a true answer it can be
rephrased as  It sucks big time Anyone who can drive the crypt workbench
will use it for light amusement before breakfast

    While the algorithm will
      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
      system

This link between the security of the keyeschrow and the actual algorithm is 
a real winner Given that I have  secret  bit numbers could someone please
explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them

   we are willing to invite an independent panel of
      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
      potential users that there are no unrecognized
      vulnerabilities

Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully OK

 
 Q   Whose decision was it to propose this product
 
 A   The National Security Council the Justice Department the
      Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in
      this decision  This approach has been endorsed by the
      President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet
      officials

Quick with out looking back What name is missing from that list

 Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry
 
 A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
      encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
      as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
      decisions related to this initiative

The people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them

 Q   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers
 
 A   The government designed and developed the key access
      encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the
      microcircuits to product manufacturers  Product
      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
      manufacturer that produces them

The reverse engineering provisions of the 'Maskwork' act could be relevent
here

 Q   Who provides the Clipper Chip
 
 A   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance
      California and will sell the chip to encryption device
      manufacturers  The programming function could be licensed
      to other vendors in the future
 
 Q   How do I buy one of these encryption devices 
 
 A   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
      the Clipper Chip into their devices

You don't Not unless you are one of the 'right people'

 Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
      solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
      powerful encryption devices
 
 A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
      considered during the broad policy review  The key escrow

They missed the word secret here He needs a grammar lesson too

      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
      that is more secure more convenient and less expensive
      than others readily available today but it is just one
      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
      encryption technology which the Administration is
      developing

I would say less secure less conveniant more expensive  PGP is free 
less available and more prone to being comprimised
Proofs to the contarary will be welcome Note PROOF

      The Administration is not saying since encryption
      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
      we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
      effectively done nor is the US saying that every
      American as a matter of right is entitled to an
      unbreakable commercial encryption product

They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense And this proposal
DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way And this is the one explicit
reference to personal rights It is a denial And yes I don't think that the
Mexicans Brazilians and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous
gesture

   There is a
      false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
      an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
      and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
      balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
      Chip and similar encryption techniques

The 'false tension' is false The balance is between two repugnant points The
RIGHT to privacy is handwaved to nonexistance by putting it behind the false
assessment It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps
YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable hence is defined
in the govenment language to be nonexistant If you don't agree you must be a
criminal as only criminals don't agree with out laws Also note the non
question If what is here was not possible

 Q   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
      that of the Bush Administration  
 
 A   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
      technology in telecommunications and computing and are
      committed to working with industry and publicinterest
      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
      privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law
      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
      and terrorism

It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty  insert
suitable retoric  and will stamp out this disorderly unruley outbreak of
freedom and ultranational sentiment

 Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
      the government hardware
 
 A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
      requirements  Casebycase review for each export is
      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices  The
      same is true for other encryption devices  One of the
      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
      to US companies operating at home and abroad  With this
      in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a
      casebycase basis for US companies seeking to use these
      devices to secure their own communications abroad  We plan
      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
      of these products
 

This one is a real giggle In Australia or France they will have to reveal the
keys and the algorithm Don't think it's at the top of my list of things I must
have so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill
of crock

Any for any others using it they must be nuts

Good luck folks

Paul

The system or 'family' key would appear to be cryptographically
useless since every chip must know it and be able to remove its
effects from the bitstream  I daresay that it will be widely known
almost immediately after this system is deployed and since it's been
pointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key  the same key
is used for both encryption and decryption  there goes any benefit
to the use of a systemwide key in SkipJack

   For example I don't own a cordless phone  With Clipper I would  If the 
   local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order 
   pizza I'm no worse off than I am now and I don't have to worry about
   local kids or nosy neighbors
I do tend to agree  Sigh

   So where can I buy a DESencrypted cellular phone  How much does it cost

Of course if we didn't have government monopolies on cellular phone service
there probably would be some available

    How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of 
    providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making 
    the clipper system the only crypto available in the US 
   The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind  

The Second Amendment is especially apt given the ITAR definitions of
crypto equipment as munitions and the guncontrol people's increasing
ability to define things as assault weapons and make them illegal
TripleDES is obviously used for assault phones while
Cripple will be legal and TripleCripple may fall into the gray area
of illegally upgrading to an assault phone

I wish I could agree with you  Ask yourself this  Why would any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least
partially compromised Key escrows in this instance  Why would any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated  ie algorythm not publically released
The answer seems obvious to me they wouldn't  There is other hardware out
there not compromised  DES as an example triple DES as a better one

What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
flames please  It comes out of a background of  years as a senior
corporate staff executive in two Fortune  companies

No wonder American businesses are going down the tubes 

I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

It's NIST not NSA  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this
They didn't say that  They said is was better than some commercialgrade
encryptions  I for one wouldn't trust them if they did unless they
release the algorithm for investigation

I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big  accounting firms

Maybe the ACLU and EFF  It would have to be a nonprofit so the big 
would be out

I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap
doorsI'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

I wouldn't trust the NSA  I think I would trust the President on this but
I'm not certain he would be told

I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
Swiss or anybody Japanese

That's your problem

This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would
feel the same way Mostmanysome pick one corporations have an attitude
that the NSA is part of our government and we support our government as
one very famous CEO put it to me one day

I want to emphasize the I am not speaking for Beckman Instruments at this
point  However we are an international company and I would like to think
that our customers come first ahead of our government's whims

Since the wiretap chip is being distributed internationally
allowing the US government to spy on foreign governments

this is a worldwide issue  Please put DISTRIBUTION WORLD on the 
Distrubution line  Thank you

ygolandwrightseasuclaedu The Jester writes

However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please who
cares about the clipper chip 

You don't care that people are being lied to fooled into believing
the chip gives privacy when it fact it allows wiretaps  You
don't give a shit about anybody's privacy except your own  And
not even your own are you so smart that you know when you're talking to
somebody who has a wiretap chip on their phone instead of a privacy
chip with private keys

attitude that everyone else should have Instead of worrying about a
clipper chip simply connect your handset to your computer and feed
the voice single through process encrypt and transmit over the
phone The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse

Simply Everyone should have this attitude   The only people
who can have this attitude are the most hardcore
computer hackers who never make phone calls away from their
computer who apparently never call anybody except another computer 
hacker or perhaps another spook US classified agents refuse to use
their own system only oblivious civilian dupes get that dubious privilege
Only spooks and hardcore hackers need privacy huh

We do need an alternative to NSAbugged telephones but
we're talking inexpensive telephones here including handsized
cellulars that need strong crypto real privacy  Makeshift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world  

What we need is a true privacy chip  For example a realtime 
voiceencryption RSA put it into a silicon compiler and spit out ASIC  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business diplomats and private communications  If the US bans 
it we make it somewhere else and import it  The Japanese German
Dutch Taiwanese Korean etc electronics companies don't want the 
NSA spying on them  US workers lose more jobs to government fascist

The final stages of denial I can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition

Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy and even seem
to feel that they're doing you a favor  If this is really surprising
to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence  There's only one political party not calling
anarchists a party that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves  If you're voting for the big two you're
supporting a reduction of those rights given their goals and their
histories regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things

  I am sure that Mike is correct on this point  I am also pretty sure that
  administering truth serum would be ruled a violation of your right
  not to incriminate yourself  But what is the salient difference
 
 You can find the salient difference in any number of th amendment
 related Supreme Court opinions The Court limits th amendment
 protections to what they call testimonial evidence as opposed to
 physical evidence

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on it has been a
couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not
missing something obvious here

Basic Scenario

	I set up a bbs that uses publickey encryption and encryption of
	files on disk  The general setup is designed so that when users 
	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
	key and the user's publicprivate keypair is used to wrap the
	onetime session keys used for encrypting the files on disk  The
	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it
	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
	machine  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed
	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
	private keys during the authentication sequence

Questions

	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any

	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am

	The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere I insert
my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom

	White House Announcement on Screw Thread Standards
	

	This is to announce that the American National Standards
Institute or whatever it is has been given the authority to define
standard dimensions for screw threads

   Look This is clearly the first step toward outlawing our
   own screw thread specifications If this madness isn't fought
   tooth and nail every step of the way it'll be a crime to use
   screw threads other than those our Fearless Leaders so graciously
   define for us

At first I was going to complain that your analogy was completely
irrelevant  But then I remembered something

Remember that move to get the US to the metric system all those
years ago  As far as I know we were supposed to be there by now

The government sold it as better for the people easier to be in
tune with the rest of the world  They had decided it was for
our own good

Then when the plan was released it soon became apparant that the
government were a bunch 'o' thickies

Think about it change all the railroad track widths signs
screws abolish the old regime

At the cost of millions of dollars

Your point is well taken  You think there is nothing to worry
about you could care less who designs your cryptography any
more than who designs your screws or the system of measurement
you use

Sit back that's right just relax we'll take care of all your
needs Mr Molitor

     In previous postings by Hellman Bellovin etal it was
reported the Big Brother Clipper chip will encrypt plaintext in
 bit blocks as is done with DES  The users key K which can be
derived from RSA DiffyHellman etc is used to encrypt
plaintext M and is then used to form a three part message
     This three part message consists of EM K K encrypted
with some other key and the chip serial number  This three part
message is then encrypted by still another key
     My question is What is a message
     For example say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized
voice application  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized
and then some number of samples are grouped into a  bit block
This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a nonsecure
communications link
     Where is the three part message  Is something appended to
each  bit block  Is a header sent at the beginning of the
session
     If the header is sent at the beginning of the session how
do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does
just that  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip
Is a facility clearance required to manufacture
     Any ideas

	Let me ask you this  Would you trust Richard Nixon with your
crypto keys  I wouldn't

I take it you mean President Nixon not private citizen Nixon Sure
Nothing I'm doing would be of the slightest interest to President Nixon 

I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another
Richard Nixon type president in the future perhaps not too distant
future acutally  With that in mind then I take it you also would
not object to the Gov coming up with a decision not proposal  just
like Clinton Cripple is a decision not a proposal sprung on us to
start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house
which could be activated without your knowlege  They would be well
concealed so you wouldn't know the location to prevent you from covering
the lens opening  After all nothing you're doing would be of the
slightest interest to a government official right  So you surely
should not object to such a proposal

Not the best anology but the principle is pretty close  the ability
to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort without your
knowlege protected by entirely by government safeguards  You can
still draw your curtains so you can still have your privacy from everyone
else except Big Brother  After all we need this for protection from
drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals like 'enemies of the
STATE' and you don't really have a right to unbreakable privacy
anyway sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION
puts it

I find it curious they use the word unbreakable when the term really
should be difficult to break without proper authorization which the
Government most certainly has at their disposal right  They wouldn't
want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY would they  Nawww not
for the People Clinton

Can you while my mind is on it give us one good reason that the
algorithm should be a secret algorithm unless this encryption scheme
either is a joke or contains features like a 'master key' or other back
door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping If it was really even moderately
secure and the government really meant to require the proper court
order and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher
the traffic what is the need to keep the algorithm secret  Seems I
hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm
to remain a secret to be effective it is not a worthwhile scheme is
this just idle talk or is the Administration bullshitting everyone

With GREAT skepticism and many doubts on our Administrations intentions

And WAIT We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in
mind for email and datafile security  The press release does say that
this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged
citizens  Perhaps 'subjects' would be the better term  'citizens'
somehow does not seem appropriate that implies a free people 'subjects'
better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers
One thing for certain  The government no longer regards the citizens
as their bosses anymore but the other way around

     Oh great Wonderful news Nobody can listen inexcept the feds 
 
    Hey it's better than the status quo
 
    I am far less worried about the feds tapping my phone than high school 
    scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
    cordless phone calls
 
 I'm a political dissident I'm scared shitless of the feds listening
 in on my calls My opinions are the sort that would get me
 disappeared in a slightly less free society  and who knows what
 sort of society we will be in in five or ten years I have friends who
 have had their phones tapped  none of this is theoretical to me
 
 As for its better than the status quo well first of all you can
 get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today  and they work
 well In addition a number of groups are now working on building
 software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now  and
 they are all working in overdrive mode
 
    And yes I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted but this is at 
    least an incrememental improvement for certain applications
 
 There ARE no crypto restrictions yet You can use anything you want
 RIGHT NOW The point is to maintain that right

The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone
scrambling system was discussed  Incidentally my MP has responded to
my questions on that issue and it appears that the UK and other approved'
countries will get the secure A encryption and dodgy' countries will
get AX  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with
AX systems but newer equipment will use AAXclear depending on the
capabilities of the base station

The copsfeds do not need to be able to get hold of your private key to
listen in to cellular conversations  Encryption is not endtoend but 
cellphone to basestation  it has to be this way so that cellular users
and fixed installations can talk to each other  For cellular to cellular
calls the transmission is decrypted at the basestation passed to another
basestation and reencrypted  The copsfeds can listen to the unscrambled
call provided they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's
equipment  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
listen without having to obtain a warrant

But maybe the Clipper system is secure and they really do need a warrant
to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner see
above  they don't have to go down this route anyway  I have my doubts
but even if true once they have the key they will never again need a
warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want  Well Judge
it appears he wasn't a drugdealer after all so naturally we'll stop
listening in'

You have every reason to be scared shitless  Take a look at the records
of McCarthy Hoover J Edgar not the cleaner  though they both excelled at
sucking and Nixon

   I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a
big hurry I expect that products using these chips will socket them
rather than soldering them since once the keys are handed over by the
escrow agencies the chip is so much garbage and will need to be
replaced I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible
chip that uses secure encryption  possibly even disguised so that it's
not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the
 backdoor keys

   If I were to manufacture such a chip as part of my marketing
strategy I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either
through bribes or industrial espionage  and then publicize the fact
doing my best not to be connected with such activities  which would
likely not be legal  Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would
go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative

  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread Any back
doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme and help grow
the market demand for a secure alternative

 I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make
few friends in the LE community but lots of money I also believe that
the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal
I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability
of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of
certain illicit drugs  ie little to none

Ian Ameline
Of course the ramblings above have nothing to do with my employer nor
do I necessarily advocate doing any of the things described here  I

Another objection occurred to me  There was a comment about how
supposedly there would only be one decode box operated by the FBI
This is flat ridiculous and I don't believe it for a millisecond
Even if they in fact only build one or two or some other small
number of these that won't stop others from building one  Make
it work like two Clipperchip phones one listening to each side
of the recorded conversation  I'll have to have another look at
the specs posted so far but offhand I didn't see anything that
would preclude this sort of thing

According to the EFF announcement on this thing the NSA has been developing
this turkey for four years  The manufacturing contract was let  months

That sounds like an old Dragnet episode

  Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect  Nobody answered the
  door but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment

Perhaps that worked in California in the 's but as I understand the
law landlords do not have authority to grant permission to search space
rented by a third party provided the lease is not in default etc
I'm not even sure if they can provide the master key when shown a search
warrant since the subject of the search is supposed to be notified

At this point the question becomes did the user rent the disk space
her encrypted file occupies  If she did it should fall under the same
body of case law that applies to apartments storage lockers etc  As
to whether any court would recognize this fact  If she did not ie
no compensation exchanged I don't know how it would be treated  there
doesn't seem to be a noncyberspace equivalent

The year lock is a nuisance but historically has been pretty trivial
It's only in an industry which doubles performance every three years or
 months for some hardware that  years is an eternity

The same thing applies in civilian development you can't patent something

The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip how it is used
how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the
escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications
Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my
own involvement in this project I'd like to add that I was not in
any way involved  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on
Thursday evening April   Since then I have spent considerable
time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this and I
attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April   
The document below is the result of that effort

                               Dorothy Denning

                                April  


INTRODUCTION

On April  the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement  At the heart of the plan is a new tamperproof encryption
chip called the Clipper Chip together with a splitkey approach to
escrowing keys  Two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key


CHIP STRUCTURE

The Clipper Chip contains a classified bit block encryption
algorithm called Skipjack  The algorithm uses  bit keys compared
with  for the DES and has  rounds of scrambling compared with 
for the DES  It supports all  DES modes of operation  Throughput is
 Mbits a second

Each chip includes the following components

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F an bit family key that is common to all chips
   N a bit serial number
   U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the ATT
telephone security device as it will be  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation my security device will negotiate a session key K with
the device at the other end in general any method of key exchange can
be used  The key K and message stream M ie digitized voice are then
fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values

   EM K the encrypted message stream and 
   EEK U  N F a law enforcement block  

The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted
under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N all
encrypted under the family key F


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF secure computer
information facility which is essentially a vault  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips  About  chips
are programmed during a single session  The SCIF is located at
Mikotronx

At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault  Agent  enters an bit value S
into the laptop and agent  enters an bit value S These values
serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers

To generate the unit key for a serial number N the bit value N is
first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block N
S and S are then used as keys to tripleencrypt N producing a
bit block R

        R  EDEN S S S 

Similarly N is padded with two other bit blocks to produce N and
N and two additional bit blocks R and R are computed  

        R  EDEN S S S 
        R  EDEN S S S 

R R and R are then concatenated together giving  bits The
first  bits are assigned to U and the second  bits to U  The
rest are discarded  The unit key U is the XOR of U and U  U and U
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies

As a sequence of values for U U and U are generated they are
written onto three separate floppy disks  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U  The second disk is similar but contains the U values  The third
disk contains the unit keys U  Agent  takes the first disk and agent
 takes the second disk  The third disk is used to program the chips
After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the
vault and the agents leave  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
assurance that no information is left behind
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two  The first two would provide the seeds S and S
and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not
be the NSA CIA FBI or any other law enforcement agency  One or
both may be independent from the government


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with
Clipper  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the
family key F  This gives them EK U  N  They will then take a
warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow
agents and get back U and U  U and U are XORed together to produce
the unit key U and EK U is decrypted to get the session key K
Finally the message stream is decrypted  All this will be accomplished
through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI

I would think that you could reduce the defense of using nonclipper
based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression 
IE free speech  That you have to right to express whatever you
want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do
not impinge on the rights of others

Encrypted textsoundvideo is just another form of expression of that
particular textsoundvideo  Just like digitized sound is another 
means of expression of sound  streams of  instead of
continuous waveforms

Also it shouldn't be up to the government at all  Encryption 
Standards can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations
apologies for the acronym  One can note how well this has worked
with ISO and the Metric System SAE etc  Independent entities 
or consortia of peopleindustries in that particular area are far
more qualified to set standards than any One government agency
Consider for example what the Ascii character set would have looked
like if it was decided by the government

I hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses  I'm still working
on mine and hope to be faxing my congressmen soon

Here are two quotes from the White House

The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the
public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it
outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the US
saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product''

In making this decision I do not intend to prevent the private
sector from developing or the government from approving other
microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring
both privacy and a secure keyescrow system''

These quotes bother me in three ways  Many people will read and
remember that encryption threatens the public safety and effective
law enforcement''  The Administration is explicitly failing to
acknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryption
to ensure his own privacy  The President by implication may
intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but
do not have a keyescrow system

I want to see an organization which will combat such statements
Encryption does not threaten the public safety any more than ski
masks do Every American is entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is not crippled by a keyescrow system
I guess I'm looking for a League for Cryptographic Freedom'' Or a
National Cryptography Association''

To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose Is a new organization
necessary Does it already exist

Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of
encryption

Currently when you send an encrypted message an opponent can usually
tell  that you are using encryption  which encryption method you
are using because that information is usually in the clear

With clipper most opponents will only know that you are sending
clippertext they won't know that your clippertext is itself
encoded

Only those few opponents who get your clipperkeys will know
that your message is double encrypted

 kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box

So don't just think of replacements for clipper also think of front
ends

bradclarinetcom Brad Templeton writes

Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one  They are
pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they
get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market
It will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that doesn't have
registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for
most phone companies

If Brad's analysis is correct it may offer an explanation for why the
encryption algorithm is being kept secret  This will prevent competitors
from coming out with Clippercompatible phones which lack the government
installed back door  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long
as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government
chips

It would be nice from the point of view of personal privacy if Brad
turns out to be right  As long as people still have the power to provide
their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper privacy
is still possible  But the wording of several passages in the announcement
makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate you can bet that the
Administration will have made it very clear to the vendors that it
would very much be in their best interests to institute a voluntary
policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment
to anyone other than Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement
or individuals and corporations who have been been determined by the
Administration to have a valid need on a casebycase basis for an
effective system

Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control
billslaws the Administration is pushing for or otherwise supporting
The logic and actual rationale as opposed to the excuses that get fed
to the media is the same in both cases only the items or technology
in question are different

I think this is no accident  It comes from the same philosophy that
the government rulescontrols the people not the people controlling
the government that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough
to know what is best for them so the government must tell the people
what they need or do not need  we know best  And the idea that
that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping
or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook


Hal Finney

Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart
chips' to encode anything they please internal passport under the
guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System and with
you can be certain more jewels yet to come and one sees an extremely
ominous trend  So what if  will be ten years late it still is
turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy unless a LOT of
people wake up and in a hurry

One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag
come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to
rights etc  from the unconnectedunprivileged citizen or should we
now be saying 'subject' instead  Why SHOULDN'T the average person
have a good secure system of data security not dependent on nebulous
'safeguards' for maintaining that security  Why SHOULDN'T the average
person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue  I am sure
the Feds could break into any data they really wanted to but it would
take some WORK and using the same logic one should not be allowed to
have a good safe unless a duplicate of the keys or combination are
submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government  I don't really see a
difference philosophically  Encrypted data sure won't evaporate not
with such hightech tools as a TAPE RECORDER

	encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK 
	and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
	message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
	producing

	     E EM K EK UK serial number  SK

My understanding is that EM K is not encrypted under SK called the
family key and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
law enforcement  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this  I
will also check it out but this is am Sunday so I did not want to wait

Ok so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the
chip the real message encrypted with the conventional key and the
serial number and encrypted conventional key encrypted with the
IMHO kind of bogus as the whole concept of one key that millions of
people use which can't be changed doesn't seem reasonable family
key

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine
which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number
and session key  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on
this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session
key and twiddles a bit or several before it's sent down the line

Mind you I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other
attacks I can't imagine and the system is probably somehow designed
so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant
receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully  But how
What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent
bittwiddling scheme so the decryption chip sees the restored
proper bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a EK UK packet that's
wrong

I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip sends that
information out many times in slightly different ways making it
effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information
being sent

Here is a disturbing thought

Now we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets We live in
the electronic age I asked myself how big could the escrow database
get How hard might it be to steal the whole thing particularly were
I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow
houses We can pretend that such will not happen but thats naive

Well lets see Ten bytes of each escrow half Lets asume ten bytes of
serial number  in fact I believe the serial number is smaller but
this is an order of magnitude calculation We assume  as the
population and that each person has a key I get five gigabytes for
each of the two escrow databases Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape This can only get easier with time but who
cares  I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my
pocket on two mm tapes

Admittely they will think of safeguards They won't put the whole
database on one disk prehaps Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks
in the way This changes nothing  they keys will be needed every day
by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types so convenience
will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval At
some point with or without collusion by the agencies those exabyte
tapes are going to get cut Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will
doubtless claim this can't happen  but we know that can't is a
prayer not a word that in this instance connotes realism

With two exabyte tapes in your pocket you would hold the keys for
every person's conversations in the country in your hands Yeah you
need the master key two  but thats just ten bytes of information
that have to be stored an awful lot of places

Come to think of it even if the NSA getting a copy of the database
isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial
political views consider foreign intelligence services You know the
ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the
evil industrial espionage that they do The French apparently do have
a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial
secrets so he isn't being completely irrational here although why
our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left
unexplained by those that point out this threat 

Presumably foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA
and other agencies We have proof by example of this its happened
many times Presumably someday they will get their hands on some
fraction of the keys You can't avoid that sort of thing

Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on
the escrow databases

We crypto types are all taught something very important at the
beginning of intro to cryptography  security must depend on the
easily changed key that you pick to run your system and not on a
secret The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our
teachers told us about but they are the sort of big secrets they
would lump into this category Imagine trying to replace  million
Clipper chips

I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this
doesn't realize all this already They are too smart There are too
many of them who have made their bones in the real world I suspect
that they know precisely what they are doing  and that what they are
doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue
to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography I suspect
that they realize that they can't put things off forever but they can
try to delay things as long as possible

Who knows Maybe even some of the higher ups the inevitable
bureaucratic types that rise in any organization really do believe
that this scheme might give people some security even as their
subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of
it all

and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American
to bear arms why is not every American entitled as a matter of

Have you read the applicable part of the Constitution and interpreted it IN 
CONTEXT  If not please do so before posting this misinterpretation again
It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individuals 
to carry handguns grenades and assault rifles  

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you  they have stated that
the people is a term of art refering to an individual right and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example

I quote

   'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained and established by 'the people of the
  the US'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms 
	 Supreme Court of the US  US v UerdugoUriquidez 

Furthermore in the Miller decision they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawedoff shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value  they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons Unfortunately no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the court in fifty years However that does not change the
interpretation

Furthermore it appears that others disagree with you as well vis

 The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history concept
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and court in the first halfcentury after its ratifi
  cation indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner
    Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate
     th Congress Second Session  February  

You might rightfully ask well then what does that first bit about
militias mean

Well militia in historical context basically means the whole of the
adult males of the country Indeed the US Code still defines
militia as all armed men over the age of 

   The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense   And  these men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time
	 Supreme Court of the United States  US v Miller 

The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment which was this by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country no centralization of military
power could ever occur which would permit tyranny  in short the
government would remain perpetually in fear of the people rather than
the other way around

   No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last
   resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
      Thomas Jefferson Proposal Virginia Constitution June 
        Thomas Jefferson Papers  C J Boyd Ed 

   And what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance   Let them take arms  The tree of liberty must be
   refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants
      Thomas Jefferson letter to William S Smith  in
       Jefferson On Democracy  S Padover ed 

   Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword
   because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be on
   any pretense raised in the United States
      Noah Webster An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution  in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States P Ford 

You may disagree with the second amendment and wish that it be
repealed but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it
doesn't mean what it says You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it should no longer be present but you can't imagine
it away

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation Many have already

However none of this has anything to do with cryptography  Lets get
it out of here If you insist on discussing this please do it in
talkpoliticsguns where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you

 The answer seems obvious to me they wouldn't  There is other hardware 
 out there not compromised  DES as an example triple DES as a better 
 one 

So where can I buy a DESencrypted cellular phone  How much does it cost
Personally Cylink stuff is out of my budget for personal use 

If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses obviously one
could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors

Indeed even without special engineering you can construct a good
system right now A standard codec chip a chip to do vocoding a DES
chip a Vbis integrated modem module and a small processor to do
glue work are all you need to have a secure phone You can dump one
or more of the above if you have a fast processor With integration
you could put all of them onto a single chip  and in the future they
can be

Yes cheap crypto is good  but we don't need it from the government
You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be
compromised When the White House releases stuff saying this is good
because it gives people privacy note that we didn't need them to
give us privacy the capability is available using commercial hardware
right now

Indeed were it not for the government doing everything possible to
stop them Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to
the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering Were it not for
the NSA and company cheap encryption systems would be everywhere As
it is they try every trick in the book to stop it Had it not been
for them I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now

They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available They are the ones
keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands When they hand you a
clipper chip what you are getting is a mess of pottage  your prize
for having traded in your birthright

And what did we buy with our birthright Did we get safety from
foreigners No They can read conference papers as well as anyone else
and are using strong cryptography Did we get safety from professional
terrorists I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on
the open market that work just fine  most of them can't be idiots
like the guys that bombed the trade center Are we getting cheaper
crypto for ourselves No because the market would have provided that
on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it

Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in
exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography

masks do Every American is entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is not crippled by a keyescrow system

  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread

The chip and algorithm are classified  If you reverse engineer it and
tell people you are likely to go to jail

Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by
cracking the system outside the USA  The US government could probably
stop importation of clone hardware but a software implementation

 The copsfeds do not need to be able to get hold of your private key to
 listen in to cellular conversations  Encryption is not endtoend but 
 cellphone to basestation  it has to be this way so that cellular users
 and fixed installations can talk to each other  For cellular to cellular
 calls the transmission is decrypted at the basestation passed to another
 basestation and reencrypted  The copsfeds can listen to the unscrambled
 call provided they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's
 equipment  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
 listen without having to obtain a warrant

 But maybe the Clipper system is secure and they really do need a warrant
 to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner see
 above  they don't have to go down this route anyway  I have my doubts
 but even if true once they have the key they will never again need a
 warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want  Well Judge
 it appears he wasn't a drugdealer after all so naturally we'll stop
 listening in'

That was true for the UK Paul but I'm fairly sure they're talking about
building endtoend encryption phones out of this chip  It's not for
cellular though it certainly could be used there in the way you suggest

somebody who has a wiretap on their phone

I find the call thru your computer ideas may reflect this attitude
Ideas that are of by and for hackers and don't help anybody in the
real world aren't going to do anybody much good including ourselves
where voice phones are concerned

We do need an alternative to NSAbugged telephones but
we're talking inexpensive telephones here including handsized
cellulars that need strong crypto real privacy  Makeshift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world  

What we need is a true privacy chip  For example a realtime 
voiceencryption RSA silicon compile it and spit out ASIC  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business diplomats and private communications  If the US bans 
it we make it somewhere else and import it  The Japanese German
Dutch Taiwanese Korean etc electronics companies don't want the 
NSA spying on them  US workers lose more jobs to government fascist

  As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist  I'at a loss for
  specific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical
 
   The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers would
 result in saying Sayonara to yet another hightech market isn't technical
 isn't in the least difficult to understand and plays on a concern lots of
 people are worried about already     

  Could you expand on this


  Simple  if you have a choice between

  American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested
     algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy
     behavoir or

  Japanese to pick the obvious example manufacturers peddling encryption
     chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under
     the control of the user

which would you choose  At most the American government can deny this
choice to American citizens and probably not that if the glorious success
of the War on Drugs is any example it can't do much about the global market

   Each chip includes the following components

      the Skipjack encryption algorithm
      F an bit family key that is common to all chips
      N a bit serial number
      U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

Hmmm A thirty bit serial number And we are told the unit key U is
derived deterministically from this serial number That means that
there are only one billion possible unit keys

   To generate the unit key for a serial number N the bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block N
   S and S are then used as keys to tripleencrypt N producing a
   bit block R

	   R  EDEN S S S 

   Similarly N is padded with two other bit blocks to produce N and
   N and two additional bit blocks R and R are computed  

	   R  EDEN S S S 
	   R  EDEN S S S 

   R R and R are then concatenated together giving  bits The
   first  bits are assigned to U and the second  bits to U  The
   rest are discarded  The unit key U is the XOR of U and U  U and U
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies

Hmmm We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial
number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U and U
is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government 
U is completedly determined given S S and N If S and S do not
change they constitute effective master keys along with F the
theft of which or the possession of which by various authorities
completely obviates the security of the system However more
interestingly we know for a fact that if S and S are fixed no
matter what the keyspace for U is no more than  Why not pick U
and U at random Why this interesting restriction of they key space
if it NOT to provide an additional back door

I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on
approximately  bytes worth of information that could be written on
the back of a napkin

Even if S and S change periodically the rationale behind this
restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is
assuming that the goal is security  and makes perfect sense if the
goal is an illusion of security

If S and S do not change even if they remain secret I wonder if
they can somehow be backderived given enough unit keyserial number
pairs We are assured that this cannot happen  but no one
understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and
soon foreign intelligence services that gain the information via
espionage Presumably we will eventually have the information as well
 reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year  but
by the time we know it may be too late

   As a sequence of values for U U and U are generated they are
   written onto three separate floppy disks  The first disk contains a
   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
   U  The second disk is similar but contains the U values  The third
   disk contains the unit keys U  Agent  takes the first disk and agent
    takes the second disk  The third disk is used to program the chips
   After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the
   vault and the agents leave  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
   assurance that no information is left behind

None of this makes me feel the least bit secure The silly notion of
destroying the laptop appears to be yet another bizarre distraction
We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned
off for more than a few moments On the other hand what we don't know
is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S and S in the
first place other than to weaken the system We don't know if the
agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their
information  its probably worth hundreds of million so you can make
the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist And to tell you the truth doing
this in a vault rather than in Joe Random Tempestshielded Room
with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make
highschool dropouts from Peoria impressed  but it does very little
for most of the rest of us

   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
   room instead of two  The first two would provide the seeds S and S
   and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to
   the escrow agencies

What would this provide Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and
the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always
honest Who cares The NSA must be laughing out loud because they
have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to
steal they keys as they effectively already have them

Buy a bigger machine

Oh but can Big Brother afford such things in these times of tight
budgets

I don't know how many folks noticed it but Dorothy Trust Me Denning gave
a real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when
she said the NSA told her they didn't even want to be the holder of any
part of the key  

Now why is that  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack  But we will
never know  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they
couldn't compromise  Ergo NSA is now capable of compromising probably
with brute force keysearch engines of the complexity of Skipjack  Look
at the specs  Why I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging
away in their crypto busters Maybe even tens of thousands  Complexity
Not much more than a   How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade

I think PGP should have  bit IDEA keys

I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

It's NIST not NSA  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this

With all the activity in scicrypt these past few days I am not supprised
you missed it NIST got Skipjack from the NSA 


I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap
doorsI'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

I wouldn't trust the NSA  I think I would trust the President on this but
I'm not certain he would be told

I am not a crook President Richard M Nixon

	the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And I'm not entirely joking about

I'm really not entirely sure I trust EFF any more to be honest

Anyway any organisation can be deeply infiltrated  Look at CND in Britain
a dozen years ago  one of their top members was an SIS spy who stole their

and copy the escrow data to disk

They don't have to track customer lists  they merely have to digitally
listen to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper

it's a nonstandard and hence easily recognisable baudrate

Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist  I've seen
them advertised in the trade press

Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems what's
left is crypto worth looking more closely at  I guess any substitute scheme
will have to be vbis or vfast to disguise it though then they just start
looking at the data too

Whatever happens though the effect of this new chip will be to make private

 Can you while my mind is on it give us one good reason that the
 algorithm should be a secret algorithm unless this encryption scheme
 either is a joke or contains features like a 'master key' or other back
 door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping

Hmm here are a couple

 If the algorithm becomes known it will be easy to produce
pincompatible noncrippled chips that provide real encryption and
privacy because their keys are only in their users' hands

 Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher it needs some way to
agree on a session key The released information says that any
protocol may be used eg DH From a theoretical point of view
this is probably true However from a practical point of view those
chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol builtin What if
it is good old RSA This will mean that the producer will have to pay
lots of bucks to PKP By keeping the details secret this can be
avoided

      Just a question 
      As a provider of a public BBS service  aren't you bound by law to gurantee
      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS if police comes
      with sufficent authorisation  I guessed this would be  a basic condition
      for such systems I did run a bbs some time ago but that was in Switzerland

The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs  they're not common carriers
they're not phone companies they're just private machines or services
operated by businesses  There's no obligation to keep records
As Perry Metzger points out if the police come with a search warrant
you have to let them see what the warrant demands if it exists
and they generally can confiscate the equipment as evidence
which is not Constitutionally valid but we're only beginning to
develop court cases supporting us  A court MAY be able to compel
you to tell them information you know such as the encryption password
for the disk  there aren't any definitive cases yet since it's a new
situation and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it
But the court can't force you to know the keys and there are no
laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys
for their own files without giving them to you

Even in areas that do have established law there is uncertainty
There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records
subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other businessrestriction law
so he gave the court the records  Which were in Hebrew
The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English
and these were the originals of the records  HE didn't speak Hebrew
and neither did anybody in the court organization  Don't think they
were able to do much about it

It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers
based on race religion national origin gender or sexual preference
it probably hasn't been tested in court but it seems like a plausible
extension of antidiscrimination laws affecting other businesses

Apologies for not posting to altclipper or whatever but it seems it
may not be in the newsfeed here

There may be another reason good from NSA's point of view horrible
from everyone else's why the algorithmchip design might be secret

First note that the experts will only look at details and of just 
the algorithm

    In addition respected experts from outside the
    government will be offered access to the confidential details of
    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
    their findings

Why not the chip design  Well here's the possiblity  in addition to
encryption the chip preprocesses voice signals to make them easier
to analyzetranscribe electronically  The chip once widespread might
effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for voice
grepping the US phone network or the criminal  wrongthinking patrons
thereof

I wouldn't put it past the NSA  Think how much easier it would make life
for them

And if this is indeed the case think of the possible public outcry should
it become widely known  Thus the secrecy

It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP voice recognition and
AI conversationunderstanding to be on that panel and insist they be
given authenticatable design specs and implementation documentation

Hmmm We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial
number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U and U
is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government 
U is completedly determined given S S and N If S and S do not
change they constitute effective master keys along with F the
theft of which or the possession of which by various authorities
completely obviates the security of the system However more
interestingly we know for a fact that if S and S are fixed no
matter what the keyspace for U is no more than  Why not pick U
and U at random Why this interesting restriction of they key space
if it NOT to provide an additional back door

I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on
approximately  bytes worth of information that could be written on
the back of a napkin

Even if S and S change periodically the rationale behind this
restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is
assuming that the goal is security  and makes perfect sense if the
goal is an illusion of security

If S and S do not change even if they remain secret I wonder if
they can somehow be backderived given enough unit keyserial number
pairs We are assured that this cannot happen  but no one
understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and
soon foreign intelligence services that gain the information via
espionage Presumably we will eventually have the information as well
 reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year  but
by the time we know it may be too late

Perhaps the trusted escrow agencies can be the ones who come up with
S and S and if these agencies are really trusted ACLU  NRA is an
interesting example we can hope that they'll use some physical
process to come up with truly random numbers If the NSA comes up with
the numbers that's a trap door you could drive a truck through

None of this makes me feel the least bit secure

Me either

   It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to
question this bogosity

    
April  
Washington DC

               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility CPSR
today called for the public disclosure of technical data
underlying the government's newlyannounced Public Encryption
Management initiative  The new cryptography scheme was
announced today by the White House and the National Institute
for Standards and Technology NIST which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan  A NIST spokesman
acknowledged that the National Security Agency NSA the super
secret military intelligence agency had actually developed the
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built

        According to NIST the technical specifications and the
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified  To
open the initiative to public review and debate CPSR today
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests
with key agencies including NSA NIST the National Security
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption
plan  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the
Computer Security Act which Congress passed in  in order to
open the development of nonmilitary computer security standards
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of
such standards

        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in
developing the socalled digital signature standard DSS a
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for
governmentwide use in   After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA
lawsuit last year the civilian agency disclosed for the first
time that NSA had in fact developed that security standard
NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying
the classification of records concerning its creation of the
DSS

        David Sobel CPSR Legal Counsel called the
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of
electronic communications as reflected in today's official
statement  a step in the right direction  But he questioned
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from
public scrutiny  At a time when we are moving towards the
development of a new information infrastructure it is vital
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be
established openly and with full public participation  It is
not appropriate for NSA  an agency with a long tradition of
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography  to
play a leading role in the development process

        CPSR is a national publicinterest alliance of computer
industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of
technology on society   CPSR has  chapters in the US and
maintains offices in Palo Alto California Cambridge
Massachusetts and Washington DC  For additional information on

        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 
The algorithm operates on bit blocks like DES and the chip supports
all  DES modes of operation  The algorithm uses  rounds of scrambling
compared with  in DES

 So in a few years there could be millions of these chips in the USA all
networked together Sounds like a good science fiction story  the government
wants to crack foreign DES or whatever messages so they con the public into
individually buying all of the components and installing them Soon the US
could be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world built on top of
our current phone net

That leads me to conjecture that

 The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks

I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would
place the onus on the individual to register keys  Realistically the
ClipperChip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier
when requesting the key fragments  The chip manufacturer would register
this identifier code vs key combination when the chip is made and the
uninitiated enduser can therefore remain completely outside the loop
The chip could be used in a cellular phone a modem or other device 
it really makes no difference  When the authorities detect the use of this
encryption standard during surveillance they would then capture the ID
and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data

If the Clinton Clipper is so very good 

Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do
with the design implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind
any moves being made using this chip as a pawn

Remember when you elect a president of the united states it's not
the case that all the Republicans etc in the NSA and FBI and CIA
immediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young
Democrats  Most of the government  say   is appointed or
hired rather than elected  Since this Clipper device has been in
production for over six months it probably has little or no 
foundation in the currently elected Democratic Executive body

BTW  those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton believe
this  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights

Secrecy in Clipper Chip

The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and
transmitted as one part of a three part message

Presumably the protocol can be recovered if by nothing else differential
analysis

Postulate if you will a chip or logic sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel  The purpose of this chip is twofold
    
	 Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the  bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the system key

	 Recieve Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable assuming the serial number
	    is necessary for local operation

This has the net result of hiding the serial number  This gets more
interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large
making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and
a spoofed serial number  Without knowing the system key you could
lie about the serial number but risk detection of the lie

IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could
successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the
format of your own serial number

Makes you wonder whats being hidden here   Seems  like the secrecy is
to prevent you from lying about who you are

 If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses obviously one 
 could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors 

I agree  So why is Cylink the only and expensive game in town

Note I think Cylink is great and if my boss would double my salary I'd buy 
a bunch of their stuff 

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in nonproprietary voice encryption systems
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme and easier to 
deploy  This is of course either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
look at it 

 Indeed even without special engineering you can construct a good 
 system right now A standard codec chip a chip to do vocoding a DES 
 chip a Vbis integrated modem module and a small processor to do 
 glue work are all you need to have a secure phone

Great  Where can I buy it

Another note If Clipper increases the incentive to bring stronger 
encryption to the mass market all the better  It's far overpriced at 
the moment

 Yes cheap crypto is good  but we don't need it from the government

I don't care where we need to get it from I care where we can get it 
from and whether it will interoperate with everyone else
 
 Indeed were it not for the government doing everything possible to 
 stop them Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to 
 the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering Were it not for the 
 NSA and company cheap encryption systems would be everywhere As it 
 is they try every trick in the book to stop it Had it not been for 
 them I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now 

You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export a 
restriction I firmly oppose  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed they want a lock on the market

 They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available They are the ones 
 keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands When they hand you a 
 clipper chip what you are getting is a mess of pottage  your prize 
 for having traded in your birthright 

Oh come on  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves  A Clipper phone 
IS NOT a substitute for a Cylink phone or a STUIII  It's a substitute 
for the voice scramblers advertised in the back of Radio Electronics

 Are we getting cheaper crypto 
 for ourselves No because the market would have provided that on its 
 own had they not deliberately sabotaged it

I disagree  Modulo ITAR it's not the government that has sabotaged the 
market

 Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in 
 exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography 

Can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right

If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against
using other cipher systems on these phones a new and potentially dangerous
class of crime is created

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specifically
the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats
will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and
to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
device will be delayed

Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate
with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means

Because lifeischeap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal
very large and conspicuous property luxury cars it is reasonable to assume
that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous
property a cipher cellular phone  Just as we have seen in the past with
blue box technology and in the present with modified cellular phones
we can expect to see among highstakes criminals a lucrative market for
stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days  The highstakes
criminals will pay the lifeischeap types substantial amounts for stolen
instruments

Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days
a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days  There will be a
continuing demand for fresh phones fresh bodies

In other words Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a
current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and
persistent threat to the general public

On the other hand if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a
device in a mostly nonciphered network the communication will at least
stand out as being unusual and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation

Finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in
realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments
there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications
in the network for expostfacto scrutiny once some criminal act is discovered
and the instruments involved have been identified  While recording and
archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks it is probably feasible
across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks  The existence of these
recordings could open up vast potential for abuse

It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost 
irrelevant  if I cannot choose the key but have to use a key chosen for
me by the foundry the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good
or as bad as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc

 or their handlers

It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER 
MANUFACTURED  after all we are talking about  to  million keys that
will ever be manufactured The key depositories can be as secure and
incorruptible as they wish to be nobody cares anyway

They key depositories are IRRELEVANT In order for the applicable law
enformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from
escrow the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text
as part of the link establishment protocol Whoever owns the program 
that assigns keys to each serial number won't need access to the key
depository

In other words the FBI may need a courtordered release of escrowed
keys but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured
There is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys While
relations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained
there is also a long history of trading favors This will reestablish
the NSA as a very important agency for everyone to get along with
because they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without court
orders

The more I think about this affair the fouler it smells I'd rather
have a DES with an engineeredin backdoor

 You don't care that people are being lied to fooled into believing the

It does give privacy just not absolute privacy  The announcement was very

anyone

 are you so smart that you know when you're talking 
 to somebody who has a wiretap chip on their phone instead of a privacy 
 chip with private keys 

Sure  The two don't interoperate  You couldn't talk to say a Cylink phone 
from a Clipper phone  I would expect even multiprotocal phones to come with 
indicators saying which kind of link encryption is in use

 We do need an alternative to NSAbugged telephones but 
 we're talking inexpensive telephones here including handsized 
 cellulars that need strong crypto real privacy

So start a company and build them  This is still mostly a capitalist 
economy

 What we need is a true privacy chip  For example a realtime

 ASIC  Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for 
 international business diplomats and private communications

    Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal how much
of a change is it  ATT's last product in this area a was priced over
 as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be b came to the customer 
with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities Thus
aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture
Clipper seems to be more of the same rather than a new direction
   Yes technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote
more widespread use but at present the man on the street is not going
to purchase a  crypto telephone especially when the guy on the other
end probably doesn't have one anyway  Am I missing something
   The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air
tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc  That
has got to a problematic scenario for them even if the extent of usage
never surpasses the 'underground' stature of PGP

   Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of
   encryption

  But if you are making custom equipment in any case why not just
roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the
Escrow agency  Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes throughNSA and those with something to hide from
NSA

  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered
to that serial number either

   They have a court ordered wiretap  But what are they going to
do  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy
All they know is that the keys are not enough but not why

   They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series
This part is really scary  Since the expectation is that all
chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S and
S and the serial number getting the keys for one of a batch may give
access to all

   There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered
without the keys  I find this one especially threatening since the
scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks  What I need to
decipher is the data in the header  If I talk to someone who has one
of these phones presumably there will be an automatically negotiated
key generated  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the
conversation to know what was said I use it as a known plaintext to
recover the backdoor represented by the header but I know what the
header says for conversations I participate in  Even worse if the
phones in a series have related keys I can buy a phonechip from the
same production lot  Then I can recover its keys either elegantly by
talking to myself or by brute force analysis of the actual chip then
apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target
keys

    Hmmm  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones
Even DES is starting to look good  Two cans and a string will provide
much better security

I can see highvoltage type display devices being vulnerable CRTs
plasma displays etc  But Jason beat me to this question  What
about EM radiation from lowvoltage items like LCD displays

Perhaps the critical element is the driver circuitry  The cabling

 Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specificall
 the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats
 will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and
 to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
 device will be delayed

Why doing it in such a rough manner It is much more professional to
steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a
pincompatible donothing chip that does not encrypt at all Chances
are that the victim will not notice anything especially if it is done
professionally

 Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate
 with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
 key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means

No because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations
True they'll blame the wrong guys but nevertheless one cannot say
something like The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'
when the Feds are listening even if they cannot identify who the
speaker is

No the criminals will just use some secure encryption The new
proposal does not stop criminals it ensures that the government will
be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper
To me it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other
strong encryption devices

  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip

The chip and algorithm are classified  If you reverse engineer it and
tell people you are likely to go to jail

Well I'm not a lawyer but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue

You see this country has this thing called a constitution

If you legitimately aquire the device and you yourself are
not a government employee or otherwise encumbered I don't think they
can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
determine Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent The First Amendment
applies here

The US does NOT have an official secrets act We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official contractor etc and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information However if they
sell you the chip I can't see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal

	The majority of the discussion involving this Clipper Chip seems to
	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations  Does anyone
	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
	signals  The language sort of suggests this but it's hard to say

I'd lay a few bucks that its just dataindataout in parallel  I suspect
to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression  There would
be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal which I suspect would scupper
any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption
front end on it

There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs  I'm sure it's purely
a digital chip  The back end will come later but I'm positive it won't
be left to the manufacturers  they all have to be the same modulation
scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them

The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones
Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true bwahahaha

 The Administration is committed to working with the private
 sector to spur the development of a National Information
 Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
 technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
 information  This infrastructure of highspeed networks
 information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV
 programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
 system transmits voice

VERY BIG HINT  See above

 Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
 role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act
 quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
 its use

  and the only conceivable meaning of 
  applying this particular technology to a computer network is that they 
  intend it to be used in exclusion to any other means of encryption 

 I disagree if for no other reason than that there are already other 
 standards in place  Besides even if they restrict encryption on the NREN 
 who cares  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway  The NREN is only for 
 geovernment and university research read the proposalsit's a data 
 superhighway for Cray users not anything having to do with the Internet

Oh I see your point  I think you're wrong  But if you sit back and wait
to find out if I'm right it'll be too late  Just listen very carefully

Date Tue  Apr   GMT

One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration
body is the ACLU  I think this is poor choice   The ACLU is
essentially a group of auditors they audit how people's civil
liberties are administered  Traditionally auditors do not like to get
involved in the design or operational aspects of things and with good
reason

When I was a systems programmer it always infuriated me that the
auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a
security point of view but wouldn't tell us how to fix it  I always
figured they just liked to critcize without doing the work to help fix
the problem

Then I took a stint as an auditor and I found out the real reason
Auditors don't like to recommend solutions because it puts them in a
bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later  The
auditee can say Well you told us this way would be OK  It
compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's
job

Taking the case at hand suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar
Suppose that perhaps through some error on ACLU's part a key half gets
away that shouldn't and is used to deprive someone of her civil
liberties  The ACLU gets wind of this and wants to take it to court
But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant
and of the plaintiff which is not an easy position to be in

There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors at one
place where I worked when payroll checks were printed they were signed
automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine  This drum
was kept by the auditors who also kept the check stock and
was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks

I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration
situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll
checks  if they were done yesterday and someone wants to do them again
today he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can
be destroyed  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are
legit is a trickier process one much more prone to mistakes that could
put the ACLU in a protectingtheclient versus protectingtheACLU
conflict of interest

As always my opinions are my own

I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap or Clipper chip is a costeffective tool for
police investigation  That is ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry
and their customers to support this wiretap technology  

A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to US law enforcement agencies  In   US
wiretaps led to  arrests while total police expenditures of 
billion led to  million arrests ref US Statistical Abstracts
I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but
I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating
the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology

Please send me quotableciteable estimates for

 How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all
  phones with wiretap chips
 How much would it cost to make each chip
 How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place
 How much more would supporting hardware people etc cost per chip
 What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been
  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs
 What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed
  law enforcement blocks
 What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year

Put another way the question I'm asking is what if each police
agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it being
charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication
to be wiretap compatible  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps or
would they find it more costeffective to instead investigate crimes
in other ways

Sorry if I was less than clear   I was referring to our own efforts
to receive export permission from NSA for the PKZIP encryption
algorithm not to any effort on the part of Phil Katz or PKWare

I should point out that the original version of this algorithm was
designed by Roger Schlafly and that WE meaning Roger and myself were
twice denied an export license for it  The second go 'round was just
this past fall

I had no knowledge of Phil's attempts in this  I do not even know for
sure if he choose to implement the algorithm as it was designed by
Roger though I believe that was at least the case for versions prior
to   And then there's the question of key management  

And even if our applications were identical there is no reason to
assume the NSA would treat them that way

If you were going to brute force something interesting that'd be the

 cite as threats will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a
 legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery
 of compromise of the device will be delayed

    Yow  get some sleep Brad  You mean that people ie lifeischeap
terrorists  drugdealing warlords who want to communicate in privacy will
prefer to break into my house kill or kidnap me and steal my telephone
rather than

         Spending  at Kmart to buy a new phone

         Purchasing a load of phones from the black market  flea market 
          super market

         Talking gasp facetoface

         Walking down to any one of millions of pay phones

         Using messengers

         Going to excruciating effort to think of code phrases like I had
          a blowout on the freeway today

    Look this system does nothing to threaten folks who know they're
being wiretapped since it's trivial to find other avenues of communication
they'd have no reason to resort to extreme measures since a plethora of
simple alternatives are easily available to them

    Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system I don't
think we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugs
murdering our families kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up just
to steal a  telephone  The system is more like urine testing  it
catches some small number of very stupid people has no effect on the bad

and penalizes most heavily those who have no cause to be subject to it

I've been a very intent NREN spectator of the NREN for years  As a

however it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet and an attempt to revive the

Longhaul networking and Internet connectivity have long since ceased to be 
under federal sponsorship or regulation at least in the USA  The success of 
the CIX Commercial Internet Exchange is a prime example of this  While our 
dear VP has been promoting his data superhighway the private sector has 
been building it without the NSFnet's restrictions

To illustrate a connection from the machine on my desk to the machine your

The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a backdoor
What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial
number


 To generate the unit key for a serial number N the bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block N
   S and S are then used as keys to tripleencrypt N producing a
   bit block R

	   R  EDEN S S S 

   Similarly N is padded with two other bit blocks to produce N and
   N and two additional bit blocks R and R are computed  

	   R  EDEN S S S 
	   R  EDEN S S S 

   R R and R are then concatenated together giving  bits The
   first  bits are assigned to U and the second  bits to U  The
   rest are discarded  The unit key U is the XOR of U and U  U and U
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies


What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated
Or should I say the need to access the Escrow houses to decrypt the data
The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion
of protection and smalltown cops won't be let in on the secret so they
will still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses but the fact
is the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit
keys from the encrypted serial number  'Nuff Said

 Why do we hackers care about the Clipper chip  Do we give a shit
 about anybody's privacy accept our own  And perhaps not even our
 own are we so smart that we always know when we're talking to
 somebody who has a wiretap on their phone

I find this a very disturbing view  Yes we DO care about EVERYONE's
privacy Even if they don't know it What happens if the gov't
starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such
technologies become the only legal encryption forms  What happens
when the Clipper is the ONLY type of encryption chips available to
the masses

Sure you might have your own method of encryption but if you don't
have anyone else to talk to what use is it  You can't assume that
EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption

The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip
Rather it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key safedeposit box keys etc and telling you
that they wont use them unless its totally neccessary  I sure
wouldn't want that  Why should encryption be any different

 It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a
 police agency  It just might be a bad idea for them too
 
 OK suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone  They
 need a warrant just like the old days  But unlike the old days they
 now need to 
 
    a get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of
        the key
 
 Now what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses
 Posessionrelease of keys becomes a political bargaining chit

	While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal
agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order there is 
still a good point here  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform
a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies   Based on the possibly
incomplete understanding of the system quoted from D Denning only the
FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer which seems
to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request  This moves
a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level
	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade
people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd  A
national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political 
viewpoints

I've seen arguing for increased government intervention and
management is almost always a plus not the least because it usually
means more high paying jobs for academics as advisors  Also
consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA  government
connections which is always a plus for an academic institute that

   Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications
  specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow
  cite as threats will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of
  a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so
  discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed

 Why doing it in such a rough manner It is much more professional to
 steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a
 pincompatible donothing chip that does not encrypt at all Chances
 are that the victim will not notice anything especially if it is done
 professionally

  Assuming that the bad guys can easily obtain substitute chips which don't
cause any noticeable effect to either the user or the person at the other end
of the line if there is any significant difficulty to obtaining such chips
some of the criminals will decide to fall back on the murderkidnap method

   Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate
  with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
  key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other
  means

  No because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations
 True they'll blame the wrong guys but nevertheless one cannot say
 something like The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'
 when the Feds are listening even if they cannot identify who the
 speaker is

 This assumes that the Feds are tapping Clipper phones belonging to ordinary
citizens getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under
discussion  To be sure I wouldn't put it past them  but raising the
possibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the Feds to either
'fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using Clipper
exposes the user to an additional criminal threat g

  No the criminals will just use some secure encryption The new
 proposal does not stop criminals it ensures that the government will
 be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper
 To me it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other
 strong encryption devices

  Agreed

I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap or Clipper chip is a costeffective tool for
police investigation  That is ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry
and their customers to support this wiretap technology  

A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to US law enforcement agencies  In   US
wiretaps led to  arrests while total police expenditures of 
billion led to  million arrests ref US Statistical Abstracts
I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but
I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating
the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology

Please send me quotableciteable estimates for

 How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all
  phones with wiretap chips
 How much would it cost to make each chip
 How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place
 How much more would supporting hardware people etc cost per chip
 What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been
  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs
 What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed
  law enforcement blocks
 What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year

Put another way the question I'm asking is what if each police
agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it being
charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication
to be wiretap compatible  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps or
would they find it more costeffective to instead investigate crimes
in other ways

Finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in
realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments
there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications
in the network for expostfacto scrutiny once some criminal act is
discovered and the instruments involved have been identified

It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained  I can even imagine this
being found legal and constitutional since nothing is actually listened to
until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained

Imagine archiving all payphone conversations so if someone turns out
to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deals  And
archive calls tofrom suspected Mafia members potential terrorists
radicals etc  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to
get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center
bombers made in the past year

Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why
wouldn't it happen

Read this through once or twice  Then replace prince with
government or president as appropriate and read it again  

From Chapter XX of The Prince by N Macchiavelli as translated by
Daniel Donno

	In order to keep their lands secure some princes have
disarmed their subjects others have prompted division within the
cities they have subjugated  Some have nurtured animosities against
themselves others have sought to win the approval of those they
initially distrusted  Some have erected fortresses others have
destroyed them  Now although it is impossible to set down definite
judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular
circumstances of the states where they may be employed I shall
nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself
will allow

	To begin with there has never been a case of a new prince
disarming his subjects  Indeed whenever he found them disarmed he
proceeded to arm them  For by arming your subjects you make their
arms your own  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal
while those who are already loyal remain so and from subjects they
are transformed into partisans  Though you cannot arm them all
nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by
extending privileges to those you arm  Your different treatment of
the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you while
the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties
and dangers should receive advantages  

	When you disarm your subjects however you offend them by
showing that either from cowardliness or from lack of faith you
distrust them and either conclusion will induce them to hate you
Moreover since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed you would
have to resort to mercenaries whose limitations have already been
discussed Even if such troops were good however they could never be
good enough to defend you from powerful enemies and doubtful
subjects  Therefore as I have said a new prince in a newly acquired
state has always taken measures to arm his subjects and history is
full of examples proving that this is so

	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he
annexes as an addition to his original domain then he must disarm all
the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire
it and these as time and occasion permit he must seek to render
soft and weak  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of
the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to
his original domain

	

	And since the subject demands it I will not fail to remind
any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants
that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him if the
reason is not natural affection for him but rather dissatisfaction
with the former government he will find it extremely difficult to
keep them friendly for it will be impossible to please them  If he
will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn
from ancient and modern affairs he will understand why it is much
easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former
government and hence were his enemies than to keep the favor of
those who out of dissatisfaction with the former rule helped him to
replace it

Finally can anyone even concieve of a timeplace where  bit keys aren't
sufficient  I certainly can't  even at a trillion keys a second it
would take about  billion years to search just one billionth of that keys
space
 
   It depends on the attack  Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of
work to be done in a straight bruteforce attack where you try every single
possible key until one works  Processing and storage requirements for this
kind of attack on a bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively
impossible  However there may be other attacks whose difficulty is for
example proportional to say sqrtn or some such  Also a long
key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little
of the key at a time

Bullshit  The Bush administration and the career Gestapo were
responsible for this horror and the careerists presented it to the
new presidency as a fait accompli  That doesn't excuse Clinton and
Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it but let's lay
the body at the proper door to start with

The final stages of denial I can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition



the date I have for this is 

note Clinton's statements about encryption in the rd paragraph  I guess
this statement doesen't contradict what you said though

 cut here 

        WASHINGTON UPI  The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
start President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation
of Police Commisioners convention in Washington
        In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural
Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War would make
everything so far seem so halfhearted that for all practical
purposes this war is only beginning now'' He repeatedly emphasized
his view that regardless of what has been tried or who has tried
it or how long they've been trying it this is Day One to me''
The audience at the convention whose theme is How do we spell
fiscal relief  FORFEITURE'' interrupted Clinton frequently
with applause
        Clinton's program presented in the speech follows the
outline given in his campaign position papers a cabinetlevel Drug
Czar and boot camps'' for firsttime youthful offenders  He did
however cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement
methods  This year's crime bill will have teeth not bare gums''
Clinton said  In particular his administration will place strict
controls on data formats and protocols and require the registration
of socalled cryptographic keys'' in the hope of denying drug
dealers the ability to communicate in secret  Clinton said the
approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground
economic activity such as the deficitcausing tax evaders who
live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren''
        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won
because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last
November everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of
urgency about fighting the drug menace  The advocates of
legalization  the advocates of surrender  may be very good at
making noise'' Clinton said  But when the American people cast
their ballots it only proved what I knew all along  that the
advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe''

So don't just think of replacements for clipper also think of front
ends

This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative nonescrowed
encryption schemes Otherwise why not just use the front end without
clipper

  The copsfeds do not need to be able to get hold of your private key to
  listen in to cellular conversations  Encryption is not endtoend but 
  cellphone to basestation


 That was true for the UK Paul but I'm fairly sure they're talking about
 building endtoend encryption phones out of this chip  It's not for
 cellular though it certainly could be used there in the way you suggest

I'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted that's what happens
when you read news at home when you're ratarsed but I did have a bunch
of followups going on about cellularcordless comms  The original article
has reappeared so

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
    enforcement

Hmm telephone communications could indeed include endtoend encryption on
ordinary landlines

    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications
links

OK it's far from clear exactly what Cripple what an apposite anagram will
be applied to but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop
people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones and he wouldn't
even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's
misfortunes

Yes Cripple might be for endtoend encyption dropping to clear
when the other end doesn't have Cripple  But then a cordlesstoordinary
conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable
as at present  Nope I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio
links

OK it's possible telecommunications networks' could mean ordinary phone
lines' but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos

My apologies if I'm wrong particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it
clear that I'm wrong and I missed it but as far as I can see it was full of
obfuscation and anyone expecting endtoend encryption is in for a surprise
IMHO


BTW Graham I've posted questions to altsecuritypgp and not seen any
repliesfollowups from outside Europe  how about you  Have I made it into
everyone's kill file or is there some problem

and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American
to bear arms why is not every American entitled as a matter of

Have you read the applicable part of the Constitution and interpreted it IN 
CONTEXT  If not please do so before posting this misinterpretation again
It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individuals 
to carry handguns grenades and assault rifles  

Read it again yourself then reapply the admonition you gave to the
previous poster to yourself as well  The first clause is not a condition
it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS MILITIA
OR NOT that the people have a right to keep and bear arms  This is
NOT a right granted by the Constitution it is a right presumed to exist
by default  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the
government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government
shall NOT infringe mess with block limit that right  Remember the
Constitution is a bunch of negative things  things the government CANNOT
do  All rights etc not epxressly given to the government go to the
states and the PEOPLE the same people the other  Amendments in the
Bill of Rights talk about

Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation I am
appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself and
you I suspect  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate
If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the
Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing  There are
some things in there that Big Brother types like Biden etc must have
really had to swallow hard to admit

I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution
and state what it means will say the same thing  Those who come up
with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the
Constitution for a given agenda  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple
Gun Control People Control and Control Control and the whole nasty
mess

Please tell us how this person is in error won't you And please back it
up with some proof since I am backing my assertion up with independent
proof and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide

			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT

			      by J Neil Schulman

If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang you'd ring up Carl Sagan
right   And if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call
would be Norman Schwarzkopf no question about it  But who would you call
if you wanted the top expert on American usage to tell you the meaning
of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution 

That was the question I asked AC Brocki editorial coordinator of the Los
Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton
Mifflin Publishers  who himself had been recommended to me as the
foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system  Mr
Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud a retired professor
journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of
American Usage and Style The Consensus

A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's
expertise

Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
before embarking on a a distinguished year career teaching journalism at
USC  Since  Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
professional aspects of journalism for Editor and Publisher a weekly
magazine focusing on the journalism field

He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary and Merriam
Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert  Copperud's
fifth book on usage American Usage and Style The Consensus has been in
continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since  and is the winner
of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award

That sounds like an expert to me

After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced
myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested I sent
the following letter

I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
English usage to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United
States Constitution and extract the intent from the text

The text of the Second Amendment is 'A wellregulated Militia being
necessary for the security of a free State the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms shall not be infringed'

The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
sentence 'A wellregulated Militia being necessary to the security of a
free State' is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect
to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence 'the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed'

I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent  Further
since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment I ask that whatever
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to
stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under
oath to support if necessary

My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment
then concluded

I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
with this letter  I am doing so because as a citizen I believe it is
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment
While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
its results I ask that you do this because of that importance

After several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for
his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our
opinions regarding the Second Amendment gun control or any other political
subject Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis into which I have
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity

Copperud The words 'A wellregulated militia being necessary to the
security of a free state' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
letter of July   constitutes a present participle rather than a
clause  It is used as an adjective modifying 'militia' which is
followed by the main clause of the sentence subject 'the right' verb
'shall'  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
maintaining a militia

In reply to your numbered questions

Schulman  Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
and bear arms solely to 'a wellregulated militia'

Copperud  The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect
to a right of the people

Schulman  Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
by the words of the Second Amendment or does the Second Amendment assume a
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state
that such right 'shall not be infringed'

Copperud  The right is not granted by the amendment its existence
is assumed  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia

Schulman  Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact
necessary to the security of a free State and if that condition is not
existing is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms
shall not be infringed' null and void

Copperud  No such condition is expressed or implied  The right to
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
of a militia  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a wellregulated
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state  The right to keep
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence

Schulman  Does the clause 'A wellregulated Militia being necessary
to the security of a free State' grant a right to the government to place
conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' or is such
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence

Copperud  The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as
previously stated  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
militia

Schulman  Which of the following does the phrase 'wellregulated
militia' mean 'wellequipped' 'wellorganized' 'welldrilled'
'welleducated' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'

Copperud  The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior
authority' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
control over the military

Schulman  If at all possible I would ask you to take account the
changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written 
years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the
intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated

Copperud To the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the
meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the
amendment  If it were written today it might be put Since a
wellregulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged'

Schulman As a 'scientific control' on this analysis I would also
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second
Amendment to the following sentence

A wellschooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free
State the right of the people to keep and read Books shall not be
infringed'

My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be

 Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
the words modify each other identical to the Second Amendment's sentence
and

 Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
to keep and read Books' only to 'a welleducated electorate'  for
example registered voters with a highschool diploma

Copperud  Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
amendment in grammatical structure

 There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
possibility of a restricted interpretation

Professor Copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his
cover letter With wellknown human curiosity I made some speculative
efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach
any conclusion

So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what
many knew all along the Constitution of the United States unconditionally
protects the people's right to keep and bear arms forbidding all
governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right

As I write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
Soviet Union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power

And here in the United States elected lawmakers judges and appointed
officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States
ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely
American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms owning
arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms  all of which is an
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms
guaranteed by the Constitution

And even the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU staunch defender of the
rest of the Bill of Rights stands by and does nothing

it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
preserve that right  no one else will  No one else can  Will we beg our
elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding
them as representing us if they do  Will we continue obeying judges who
decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but
means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak 

Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice as the Constitution
of the United States promises us we can and pledge that we will defend
that promise with our lives our fortuned and our sacred honor

 Have you read the applicable part of the Constitution and interpreted it IN 
 CONTEXT 

Yes BTW the appropriate Amendments were posted here some time ago

 If not please do so before posting this misinterpretation again
 It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individual
 to carry handguns grenades and assault rifles  

It's OK it's OK Just a month ago I expressed my belief that the
right to have a means to shoot your neighbor is not that much
necessary to ensure a people's right to be free and got flamed by lots
of American gun supporters So I thought that

Never mind The new Cripple Chip is a purely American problem so deal
with the mess yourselves I just wanted to share with you a bit of my
experience of living  years under a totalitarian regime I'm
Bulgarian  because I thought that it might be useful to you Oh
well

I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant
We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot
happen here as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day
because the government justifies doing some endrun around the protections
by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'   It is most likely that in the
future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession
of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools' and be some serious Fedaral Felony
Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so common
computer programs even computers themselves are now 'hackers tools'
and will become 'terrorist tools'  BET ON IT

The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important
If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states
as far as individual rights privacy and overall freedom are concerned
the rest of the world remember 'New World Order' will not be far
behind  only a few years

Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens
ones rights in this thing

For example a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer
be private from Big Brother eavesdropping  Political dissent allready
is very dangerous in this country all it takes is the government to
decide that enough people will take one seriously then one becomes
guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'  The
phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it
to be defined as

Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card an
'Internal passport' with the added wrinkle that anything about you and
your past can be put on it and you can only take the government's
word as to what is really on it since they will be the only ones
with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing  Isn't
that nice

While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys the owner
knows his safe has been broken into  When they break into your 'secure'
phone conversations or other storedtransmitted data in the near future
you have no way of knowing so accountability as to the legalities has
gone out the window  Just like a safe if they have a legal cause they
can get the keys from the suspect just like they can get the keys to
a safe or the combination from the suspect  Same with encryption
Record everything get the warrants THEN decode it with the keys
obtained from the suspect

This Clinton Cripple along with its natural extensions will make any
priviliged communications between client and lawyer and any meaningful
political dissent virtually impossible  Which is the general idea
Any propeganda about its being secure and the safeguards and all
of that are just that  propeganda to reassure people so they will
by into this monstrosity  DON'T BE SUCKERED

BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING

 Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
 one Make it voluntary

As usually you are not reading The proposal does say that it is a
voluntary program This doesn't make it more desirable though

 That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
 to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

Secure How do you know Because NSA is trying to make you believe it
Trust us Yeah right

Otherwise you are on your own How do you know that tomorrow they
will not outlaw encrypring devices that don't use their technology
Because they are promising you Gee they are not doing even that 
read the proposal again

One minor nitpick  It is not a proposal  It is a DECISION  from their
point of view it is a DONE DEAL  The chips are being manufactured it
obviously has been budgeted the whole thing  THAT IS WHAT IS SO UPSETTING
THIS WAS ALL DONE IN SECRET  Because they DIDN'T want the people to know
what was going on until it is too late

Otherwise I agree with you  percent

How come it always takes someone who has lived under the Eastern Bloc to
remind us about how precious and fragile our liberties are

Please keep up the good work  Hopefully you will wake SOMEONE up

  But if you are making custom equipment in any case why not just
roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the
Escrow agency  Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes throughNSA and those with something to hide from
NSA

This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about
Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a
counterfeit one if the serial number contains a checksum

Chances are the government has thought of this and just anyone won't be
permitted access to enough of the internals to make a fake clipper chip
Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals
at a very high level and manufacturers are required to observe security
safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level

While not perfect it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing
chip since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation
Some of the more notorious selfstyled dissidents here for example have
already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little
chance of getting a clearance

Of course it's not impossible that someone do this but probably extremely
difficult Chances are there will also be very heavy criminal penalties for
phony clipper chips on some national securityclassified info grounds or
other thus making the game not worth the candle

The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip
Rather it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key safedeposit box keys etc and telling you
that they wont use them unless its totally neccessary  I sure
wouldn't want that  Why should encryption be any different

Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their
product the manufacturer actually better yet some trusted pair
of escrow agencies has to have the key

Most of us already are in this situationour car makers have keys to our
cars or can get them quickly from the VIN  number and I have no doubt
that if presented with a court order they'd surrender copies to the
government

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks
they've installed and in an emergency can cut keys thus they'd also
provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order

The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they
have a court order

Bad analogy

This is not to argue for or against the proposal but rather better
distinctions are required in thinking about it than house key safedeposit
keys etc

I want to see an organization which will combat such statements
Encryption does not threaten the public safety any more than ski
masks do Every American is entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is not crippled by a keyescrow system
I guess I'm looking for a League for Cryptographic Freedom'' Or a
National Cryptography Association''

An excellent idea


To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose Is a new organization
necessary Does it already exist

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF 
from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for 
strong cryptography through a distinct organization

The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
and pictures newsgroups at various universities Horror stories about the
contents of those groups eg exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
models have already surfaced in the press The White House bulletin
already raised the specter of drugdealing and terrorism which is only one
step removed from the old cryptowielding child molester argument  An
EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the
connection to child pornography and the like

Similarly LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project  In
light of say the Gnu Manifesto this means that in a public debate it
stands to be labelled as communist anarchist hackers radical etc  

I don't know about CPSR but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social
Responsibility best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical
antinuclear lobbying then it probably also carries unwelcome political
baggage

Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography
would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing
group but its charter should then be distinct independent and limited to
advocacy for the right to cryptography  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's
question does any suitable organization exist  If not what are you going
to do about it

Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations
I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction
gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
issue as well as the FirstAmendment side

I'm not a lawyer so correct me if I'm wrong but doing that could be
considered obstruction of justice which could land you in prison for
quite a while

The thing that's great about the secret key is it is IDEA encrypted so
even if the FBI do get the key they're SOL unless they know the magic
word  If they try to force you to give them your pass phrase just say
Oops I forgot  Since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution
in this country if you keep your mouth shut how can they prove that you
didn't forget your pass phrase

  OK Doug is right it would be obstruction of justice blah blah blah
BUT saying I forgot is a lie which is just as bad from a moral point
of view IF you think lawfulness is a good in and of itself which 
admittedly most people do not  But there's an even better way out of this
PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally you can probably
plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key  The
government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which may
tend to incriminate that defendant  Though this has never been applied
in the cryptography context at least as far as I can tell it seems an
obvious application to me  

 This may be a common suggestion in this group but if it's not I'm new
here I'd love to hear what people have to say about it  Since I don't
really read this group and since the subject matter is more legal than
cryptoid maybe misclegalcomputing would be an appropriate place

I say in theory because in another case a woman was held in
contempt for refusing to reveal the location of her child even after
taking the th In this case the woman was suspected of having
murdered the kid so taking the th wasn't surprising Sure so she
was probably guilty but that's not good enough In our system you're
not supposed to be able to force a suspect to confess to a crime no
matter how strongly you think they're guilty  You have to develop
your evidence independently Doing otherwise might catch a few more
crooks but only at the cost of turning the clock back to the middle
ages when confessions were routinely tortured out of suspects both
guilty and innocent

 OK I should have read the thread before posting my own   I would
just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat the
fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases  nor shall any person 
  be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
Thus if the father sued for custody of the children the case would be
civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection
Oddly enough her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to
criminal contempt charges thus landing her in jail  The interesting part
of all this is that in a murder trial the woman CAN plead the fifth as 
to the location of the childthis is routine  A computer crime 
prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense 
where a suit by a party injured by hackers would not  If I am accused 
for example of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should 
protect my key  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material however
it proabably will not copyright infringement not being a crime in the
technical sense  The REALLY tricky question is say I do both naughty
boy that I am can the government use the information gained in the civil
trial ie my key to gain access to my files for use in the criminal
prosecution  The answer should certainly be no but lord only knows how
this would work out

I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap or Clipper chip is a costeffective tool for
police investigation  That is ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry
and their customers to support this wiretap technology  


First what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing
policy papers on stuff far outside of their purvewmission
                                                                         
Do us a favor  Resign rather than right this paper for NASA  Go
do useful work for the society

Whew  Take it easy on the guy  Maybe he's going to do this in his
spare time  Maybe he's going to do this to see how much a wiretap
really costs  Maybe he's going to do this so he can add to the
opposition to Clipper  I don't know fully why he might do this but
maybe we shouldn't start flaming at the drop of a hat

strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes

 dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the
 effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police Actually reading
 between the lines it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one
 respect since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and
 local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally

Instead of reading between the lines try to think a little bit OK
if that's way too difficult to you here are some hints

Indeed the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone So guess what they will
do Propose that the new technology is removed Or implement some
facilitations Of course you won't want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters because meanwhile those two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child right So
there should be some way for them to get access to those keys
quickly right Like they could have a copy of the database and
worry about a warrant later

I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post but that's
what I get from posting at  am

The central point I made is that localstate police agencies attempting to
play by the rules and get warrants legit escrowed keys etc may find
themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting
at the federal level  

I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy
cops  It would be a strong incentive as Vesselin points out for more
police agencies to go rogue and try to get keys through more efficient
but less Constitutional means  Notice what the release said

   Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
        encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
        decipher the message

   A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
                                                       
        court order to do the wiretap in the first place
        

The clear implication is that there are legal authorizations other
than a court order  Just how leaky are these  And who 
knows what's in those  pages that authorized the NSA  There
may well arise a black market of sorts within police agencies in which
keys are traded  Furthermore the police will be in an excellent
position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught  They
already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions  There
are a few laws that I know of that limit citizens' rights to access
police communications or use the information they get  It may be
very difficult to prove police misuse  the fact that you have such
evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law

Throw in private detectives who have even fewer policyconstitutional
restrictions  Also consider mercenaries who've retired from intelligence
agencies  William Gibson must be loving it  Great story material

Don't think it'll happen  

Well consider eg the Michigan State Police generally a very professional
organization which for years kept Red Files on thousands of suspected 
commies knowing full well it was not consititutional  The standards
of evidence were just about zero people were in the file because they
happened to park near a place where say a USChina People's Friendship
rally was happening  the police went around writing down license
plate numbers  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the 
meeting place well the state police wound up filing you as a subversive
They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any
more such nonsense  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes
as well

Even with wellmeaning cops and I'm sure there are many there will 
be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards  We don't need
to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers  it will all be in the interest 
of enforcing sensible laws saving lives and protecting property  
Compromises will be made by wellmeaning officers facing what to them 
will be a moral dilemma

Clipper will make criminals out of cops  Do we want to do this to our
police forces

fine as long as the privae key remains secure

In practice it would be a good idea to check to see if that would be a
violation of some net rule practice custom etc I don't say it would be
just that it would be a good idea to check This is not like rot where
everybody can have the key trivially

It would also be a good idea to check to see if such posts would be
forwarded by the sites needed to make the chain work

Of course there'd be no problem with a discussion group travelling over

also be no problem with a mailing list approach It might even  be fun for
some

Would you trust a blackbox from the NSA versus an open system from
elsewhere

Absolutely if I were assured by someone I trusted that the black box was
more secure I have nothing to conceal from the government but I would like
to be sure that any Russian Japanese French or other competitors for my
services can't read my traffic I'd like to be sure that competitive bid
information was safe from commercial competitors and foreign governments
which would aid them

I believe the NSA has identical motivations with respect to my activities
The President and many other senior government officials have made it very
clear that they share these motivations Thus I'd trust them on the
coincidence of interests argument as well as on a basic trust in their
professionalism and a high confidence in their skills

   Hmmmm  I think with really large keyspaces like this you need to
alter the strategy discussed for DES  Attempt decryption of several
blocks and check the disctribution of the contents  I don't think it's
at all feasible to keep  encryptions of a known plaintext block on
any amount of tape or CDROM  And certainly not  such encrypted
blocks  Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
system into a one bit storage device
 
   Actually a keysearch of this kind shouldn't be much worse than the
simpler kind in terms of speed  It's just that you have to do it over
for every encrypted message
 
   Dumb question  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many
legitimate ASCIIencoded byte blocks there are that could be part of
an english sentence  For attacking DES in ECB mode it seems like a
dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable

er excuse me but since the escrow agencies aren't yet chosen how can you
say they have a history of untrustworthy behavoirsic

I'm sure each of us can think of agencies without such a history Price
Waterhouse has kept the secret of the Academy Awards for many years even in
the face of an aggressive press The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
has successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until
publication Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop
forecasts from leaking prematurely

Frankly I'd trust the above not the D of A of course since they might be
subject to political pressure far sooner than the ACLU EFF or CPSR which
though not exactly government apologists have no particular track record
for internal security that I know of

Normally I'd be the last to argue with Steve    but shouldn't that
read  years for all solutions  I mean if we can imagine the
machine that does  trialnanosecond we can imagine the storage medium
that could index and archive it
 
   Hmmmm  I think with really large keyspaces like this you need to
alter the strategy discussed for DES  Attempt decryption of several
blocks and check the disctribution of the contents  I don't think it's
at all feasible to keep  encryptions of a known plaintext block on
any amount of tape or CDROM  And certainly not  such encrypted
blocks  Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
system into a one bit storage device


I don't claim to be a crypto analyist there isn't a whole lot of good
literature on the subject and the best people don't seem to publish
their work   but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute
force sorry to have implied that in my previous post  The history
of these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and
bang from there

I guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA would
make publicly available a system they couldn't break if they wanted
it just isn't in their charter  Remember DES came from IBM not NSA
and when first published was given a useful life of  years I think
we are well past that point now 

Remember based on the size of the NSA budget they spend a lot more
on the technology of decryption than most computer companies spend on
RD  I have to imagine their stuff is real interesting

A friend who once worked for them he is dead now said he always enjoyed
monitoring SAC's Strategic Air Command crypto traffic   and I rather
suspect that stuff is a bit more complex than Skipjack  Or was it the
military got the stuff from the NSA just like we get Skipjack from them 
BTW folks NSA wasn't being given the keys  And the Walker spy case
shows for some of the systems the KGB didn't need them either

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in nonproprietary voice encryption systems
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme and easier to 
deploy

I may be an anarchist nutcase but I wouldn't have frothed overmuch
had the government proposed a secure encryption standard  In fact
if the NSA had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap
chip I would have been happy  They could have done this  set
up an ANSI committee picked a secure cryptosystem defined a
protocol and interface and said Hey start building them

Instead we have a deliberately braindead version of a cryptosystem
that has not even been peer reviewed  Yes the NSA owns some smart
people  But if they pulled a FEAL well ATT is going to be left
with a lot of dud phones on its hands

Perry said
 Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in 
 exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography 

Can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right

Heh heh  The government already gave it up for us  Remember in the
announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two
extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a
Constitutional right to encryption  

So much for Clinton's support of the right of privacy

 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE
 
 Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
      encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
      decipher the message
 
 A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
      court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
      would then present documentation of this authorization to
      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
      smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
      escrow system

I apologize for being so dense but this sentence reads as if it
was lifted from a Luis Bunuel screenplay  Am I missing something
Why on earth would drug smugglers even use the device then
Obviously they'll be using something like triple encryption DES instead
As long as alternatives to Clipper remain legal Clipper accomplishes
absolutely nothing ZERO as far as law enforcement is concerned
The whole scheme is an absolute total incredible waste of government
time and money AS LONG AS other encryption schemes that are any good 
remain legal  In order for Clipper to work as intended all strong
cryptosystems have to be outlawed

 What is the status of cruptology for private citizens throughout the
 world or more clearly is there a listing of countries and their
 policies on citizens encrypting electronic data  
 
 I'm curious how the Europeans handle this for instance
  

Good question I also wanted to find out and I did a while ago

In our former communist times such activity ie sending crypto emails
would be prevented sooner ot later law or no law But now there is no law 
against it So we are free to use it We now have an EC conformant law for 
protection and registration of personal files You must remember that the 
situation in small countries is vastly different from the big ones

In article optilinkCOM bradoptilinkCOM Brad Yearwood writes
If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against
using other cipher systems on these phones a new and potentially dangerous
class of crime is created

Aside from possession of terrorist tools unapproved encryption devices
or programs

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specifically
the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats
will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and
to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
device will be delayed

Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate
with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means

Because lifeischeap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal
very large and conspicuous property luxury cars it is reasonable to assume
that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous
property a cipher cellular phone  Just as we have seen in the past with
blue box technology and in the present with modified cellular phones
we can expect to see among highstakes criminals a lucrative market for
stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days  The highstakes
criminals will pay the lifeischeap types substantial amounts for stolen
instruments

Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days
a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days  There will be a
continuing demand for fresh phones fresh bodies

And since Clinton is also going fullbore to deny unconnected citizens
the means to defend themselves we will protect you   is good
enough for you by perverting or trashing the Second Amendment
the targeted individuals will be GUARANTEED easy prey  What is a few
bodies compared to the greater good of the Fed being able to defeat
a citizen's security with impunity  You don't think there doesn't
exist a means by which the NSA can do their usual eavesdropping scanning
for keywords with OR WITHOUT a court order or any 'keys' do you
If so I got some great Florida real estate you might be interested in

Perhaps the idea of escrowed keys is meant to divert the discussion to
how they will be safeguarded and away from the basic fact that the
government is systematically taking away our right to privacy to be
secure for the means of selfdefense and just about every other right
spelled out in the Bill of Rights

Nawwww  they are the GOVERNMENT  Trust us

In other words Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a
current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and
persistent threat to the general public

What is more important to the government  Law Enforcement people control
or the safety of the general public  The gun control issue should answer
that one  look at how good that works in making cities safer  The places
that are the worst in that regard are also the places with the 'best' gun
control  Government is NOT about public good it is about CONTROL

Never forget that  Our Founding Fathers sure were concerned about it

Absolutely  I just meant that no secure dedicated crypto device has
ever been given approval  Guerrilla underground devices should be well
possible with today's highspeed modems not that I can think of many vbis
modems that are approved either mind you  just the overpriced Couriers

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run

	Nobody I know has claimed Clinton intitiated the program But he chose

Perhaps the NSA realised that noone would even contemplate falling for
the dualescrow bluff while under the Bush administration and had to

The key question is whether nonClipper encryption will be made illegal

It seems pretty obvious that it will be made illegal if VERY LOUD NOISE is
not made about this IMMEDIATELY to Congress and the House

It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals
are coming true  If the government continues on this course I imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal  Encryption programs
for disk files and email as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications will be distributed only through the
underground  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy
 
I don't know what's worse  the waste of money or the fact that in SPITE
of all Clinton's rhetoric to the contrary this is a feeble attempt by
a large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify their currently
useless jobs Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government
This doesn't look very dietetic to me 

As I said before in this group drug dealing and terrorism both tend to
be international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to
regulate encryption The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to
other countries to communicate their plans and will still carry them out
here andor wherever else This is not the solution to the problem

They try to invent a new problem by saying we need encryption I guess
it's a good thing Bill Gates isn't a star general or we would all need
our own copies of MSDOS too right

Und vee haff vays uff findink out iff you are usink DOCTOR DOS

It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here

Our health care and education systems are in the toilet and they come up
with THIS pearl If this goddamned government doesn't get a clue real quick
and start trying to repair the infrastructure of the country rather than
inventing someone to blame Germany and Japan are going to eat the US alive
and we will deserve it It's not like there's any shortage of REAL problems
to solve guys 

A Clipper chip is really going to help the homeless A Clipper chip is
really going to help educate the children in the ghettos of our cities
Just think of the generation gap that can be developed when they rehire
DoD engineer dad to work on Clipper chips that will be used to decrypt
slightly rebellious adolescent hacker son's naughty GIF files I can see
the shitcom already

  As an economist I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic If the naive
market is flooded with proprietary but weak encryption then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete

This is true for the mass market but not for those who need strong crypto
and are willing to pay the price After all one can buy strong crypto today
if one is willing to spend enough

Thus the concern is not economic

The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold the
government will outlaw other systems and something voluntary will become
the only system available That is a political not an economic issue

As a separate matter you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent
that except via Clipper but cheap secure crypto for everyone is a
political discussion not an economic one and the whole point of Clipper is 
to resolve that political policy tension between securing legitimate
communications and tapping the crooks

Agreed  Remember I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real 
senseif I did I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it

 Heh heh  The government already gave it up for us  Remember in the 
 announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two 
 extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a 
 Constitutional right to encryption  

That's not for Clinton or anyone under him to say though  Only the 
federal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality
Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at

   maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build

   But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as

if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY  One chip
one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks and that
break gives you all messages involving that phone

   The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you
nothing is an improvement but notice that XORing with truely random
bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents  Using 
for XOR SK for the escrowed key and A and B for two random bit
strings hand SKAB SKA and SKB to three escrow agents  It is
possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern
for example  of  such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives
the cracking agency no benefit

I wrote
The chip and algorithm are classified  If you reverse engineer it and
tell people you are likely to go to jail

Well I'm not a lawyer but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue

The US does NOT have an official secrets act We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official contractor etc and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information However if they
sell you the chip I can't see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish
but there are certainly exceptions  If you write a paper which includes
sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon it is
classified  As I understand the law nuclear weapons design is
automatically classified even if you do the work yourself  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper

A less serious example if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are
about to run into you can be fined even though you might argue that you
broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman  The charge
is interfering with a police officer which is quite similar what you would
be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip

Don't tell me that you think this violates the Constitution  find some
court cases which have struck down such laws  Many people would not be
comforted by the fact that the government violated their rights when it
imprisoned them

Excerpts from the Clipper announcement with some questions

        the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data under proper court or other legal
          order when necessary to protect our citizens

Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message

A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
     court order to do the wiretap in the first place  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers  The key is split into two parts which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system

In these two sections the phrases or other legal order' and normally a
court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal
wiretap What isare these How do they affect the way people who trust the
system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system

The second section shows the sequence of events
The law enforcer armed with his warrant attaches his headphones to the
line with his crocclips remember these are the folk who couldn't cope
with digital telephony and hears a load of modemlike tones we are
talking analogue telephony here
What next What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use
Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained
I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some
intermediate point on the line Maybe they have taken a crash course
in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the
digital stream for decryption later This would still suffer from the
same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not
be at one end of the line If calls can't be recorded for decryption later
it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units
these are supposed to be cheap mass market items and using them in turn

How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors These things are proposed
for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices where phone
line quality may well be poor It seems hard enough to me to get digitised
speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to
add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync

Q   Will the devices be exportable  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware

A   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements    One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to US companies operating at home and abroad  With this
     in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     casebycase basis for US companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad
     

This raises an intersting question in the UK Here it is illegal to connect
anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body
called BABT It has been stated either here or in the uktelecom group
that they will not approve equipment that does encryption I don't know
if this is true or not but this would make a good test case
Perhaps friendly' countries and the UK may still qualify will get
to fish in the escrowed key pool as well

Summary Nothing spooky it's an Executive Order

tuinstrasignalececlarksonedusoe writes

  It would be a strong incentive as Vesselin points out for more
police agencies to go rogue and try to get keys through more efficient
but less Constitutional means  Notice what the release said

   Q   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
        encrypted using the device  What would they have to do to
        decipher the message

   A   They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a
                                                       
        court order to do the wiretap in the first place
        

The clear implication is that there are legal authorizations other
than a court order  Just how leaky are these  And who 
knows what's in those  pages that authorized the NSA  There


I was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy CTRSN nothing big  All 'spooks'
in the Navy are required to know the gist of USSID  the Navyway of
naming a particular Presidential Executive Order  It outlines what spooks
can and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals

The following information is of course UNCLASSIFIED

The whole issue hangs about what you mean by wiretap  If the signal can
be detected by nonintrusive means like radio listening then it may be
recorded and it may be analyzed  Analyzed means that it may be either
deciphered andor radiolocation may be used to locate the transmitter

The catch is this  Any and all record of the signal and its derivatives
may only be kept for a maximum of  days after which they are destroyed
unless permission is obtained from the US Attorney General to keep them

Didn't you ever wonder how Coast Guard cutters find those drugrunners
in all those tens of thousands of square miles of sea even in the dark

   	The algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar
   government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary
   design that the Feds say that NSA developed  Is there a patent  Is that
   patent publicly available  My betting is that that too is classified

   Unless there has been a major change in the law there's no such beast
   as a classified patent  Patents exist to encourage communications and
   develop the state of the art 

While there aren't classified patents there are patent secrecy orders

Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio and apply for a patent
The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested gives them a copy
of your application and you get a nice note back saying your patent
application has now been classified for national security reasons and
you're no longer allowed to make and sell it  
I'm picking this example because it happened in the late s
It was probably some analog scrambler and would have probably
violated FCC rules anyway but it did get classified

Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and
then file a patent application  Since it's been published
they can't gain anything by classifying it though you can't get
patents in most countries other than the US where patent laws are different

Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus
You can't sell that widget because there's a classified patent on it
You're not allowed to see the patent or know who owns the design
so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we won't throw
you in jail for espionage  Some countries might have that kind of
system  but we don't have that here  Quite  Yet

 Thousands  Tens of thousands  Do some arithmetic please  Skipjack
 has  possible keys
 
 We don't yet know if all  bits count

That doesn't worry me at all they're not going to cheat at something
they can get caught at  And key size is one of the things that can be
verified externally  Feed lots of random keyinput pairs into the
chip then try flipping random key bits and see what happens to the
output  We already know what should happen  about half the output
bits should vary on average from a bit key change or input change

If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that
some of the bits are much less powerful than others in the sense that
they only enter into the encryption very late in the game  By contrast
DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible the  output
change rate appears as early as round   Again though I don't think
NSA is going to cheat that crudely they're likely to get caught

Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
the cryptosystem design  If you assume something DESlike a biased
subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb  The committee
can and should run lots of tests and retain the output  This can be verified
later against the chip  And yes the civilian community has at least some
secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without
it being noticed until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again
Oops  I don't think I was supposed to talk about that  The committee
members can even retain secure copies of the code  in two halves which
you have to XOR together to recover the program

Seriously there are I think problems with this whole scheme  But the
people who invented it aren't stupid and they've been in the crypto game
and the smokeandmirrors game far longer than most of us  They're not
going to lie in ways that can be detected easily since their credibility
is the only thing they can use to sell this system  If they've lied
about the civilian committee no one will believe them about the absence
of other back doors  If they've lied about the key size no one will
believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys
If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem
no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them

That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things
anyway  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem
with a back door that the committee can't find  look how long it took
for folks to believe that the Sboxes weren't sabotaged  It's entirely
possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report for just
such reasons  But that's a subtle point ie one you can't explain to
a Senator

 Anyway its looking like the
 keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA
 can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number

I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do
However  S and S are supposed to be under control of the same
escrow agents  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure
they can't be trusted to keep the halfkeys secure

I still don't know if or when S and S change  I thought I had seen
something about them being constant but I just reread Denning's technical
information post and it doesn't say anything one way or the other

 If there are many as er people in the USA who reason like the 
 above then it should not be surprising that the current plot has been 
 allowed to happen 

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in 
exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA and is an 
endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size  The structure 
of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent but 
fighting entropy is always a losing battle  Most people would rather have 
comfort than freedom  The paradox is that you can't really have the former 
in the long term unless you have the latter

One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird 
cross between a libertarian and an establishment tool is that I end up 
taking an utterly pragmatic view of government  I don't get up in arms when 
the government fails to protect the interests of the people because in my 
lifetime it never hastherefore I have no expectation that it will  

As a result I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government 
to be fair  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed 
whether or not it is legal at the time  Same thing with anything else the 
government would rather not see in private handsthat's their problem  
What's important to me is using the right tool for the job  If it's legal 
so much the better  If it is not but does not violate my very strong 
sense of personal ethics I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth 
it  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its 
citizens except by accident is utter folly  Even Jefferson one of the 
major architects of the American system of government figured that in a 
couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and selfserving that it 
would be time dismantle it and try again by revolution if necessary  I 
agree and while I don't go around trying to spark one I'll certainly 
participate if it happens when I'm around  There is a reason I am such a 
strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics  
I've already written off politics

And yes this may get me in trouble some day  If so so be it  I drive 
faster than  MPH too

Let's start with looking at the professionals the NSA itself

in   Until even  not even one word of this executive
order chartering the NSA was sealed  Paranoia right

On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence
with multiple rows of barbed wire with high voltage complete with signs
prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal
Security Act  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit
television  More paranoia

These are professionals  Maybe they know something we don't eh

Or maybe the Germans should have been a little more 'paranoid' about
their Engima with respect to Turing and the British

How about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram  Would a little
more paranoia have helped the Germans here

Maybe the NSA should have been a little more 'paranoid' about
Emma Woikin or Joseph Sidney Petersen Jr or  

Maybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation
with the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic
Secrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers paranoia right

The most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was
the onetime pad even with the necessity of keeping incriminating
evidence about is known to be the only proven unbreakable system
Soviet paranoia right

And what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers  And 
huge Rhombics pointed embassy row  And their sites near
satellite uplink and downlink sites  Duh

When I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time
even with a secret clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet
and the entire site was built INTO a Moslertype vault with very
thick bombproof door  MITRE paranoia

I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support as
best hypothesis the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as
it can as fast as it can  One would be a fool to ignore the
pattern of facts and conclude that they were random

And we know the government is violent  even against children as
recent events prove  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace
but a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence
that our government institutions have in their contempt for our
civil rights

And of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of
caution because that does much less harm than erring on the
reckless side As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver

I might suggest Andrew that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and
Bamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to
support your sheepish acquiescence to authority

It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained  I can even imagine this
being found legal and constitutional since nothing is actually listened to
until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained

Imagine archiving all payphone conversations so if someone turns out
to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deals  And
archive calls tofrom suspected Mafia members potential terrorists
radicals etc  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to
get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center
bombers made in the past year

Imagine if this were available during the  elections instead of
clumsily searching through the Clinton passport file they could have 
just done a voicegrep as someone stated earlier on his telephone
conversations for the last  years

I'm not a lawyer and I don't even play one on TV but intuitively there's
something wrong with having one's words archived for possible future
use against you  This possibility frightens me more than any of the
talk about the Clipper Chip right to cryptography etc

Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why
wouldn't it happen

I'm afraid it just might

Generally an organization has influence in proportion to

	The narrowness of its objectives
	The number of members
	The strength of belief of its members

This is why the pro and antiabortion groups are so strong narrow objectives
lots of interested members who are real passionate

For this reason mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea  It diffuses
the interests of both groups  It may well diminish the Passion Index
of the combined organization  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge
the NRA

So I believe a new organization which may cooperate with NRA where the
two organization's interest coincide is the optimum strategy

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down K  I think it is I've heard it's not  Lets
say  bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

A good vocoder like ours will give you  bits per second locked at
full rate it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder  If you want
less quality cut that to  bps half rate  At full rate variable
you could put two fullduplex conversations on a Vbis modem  This
requires a DSP or ASICs though  An RS has a CPU that could
probably do it in realtime because it has the addandmultiply
instruction and a few other DSP things

If you want to do speech in realtime you need about  samples a
second for not very good voice with your  bit samples ISDN is 
bit samples a second which is  kbps  You could do a fast 
compression on that to get it down to  kbps which is just about
Vbis  The quality at this point is very bleah but it should work
Now add in the time for your encryption method  You're going to need
sampling hardware which is no problem on a new Mac an Amiga  Or a
PC with a SoundBlaster card just because they're so popular and cheap
 you could also build a simple ADC  The problem with the
SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex  you can't
sample and play backq at the same time making a twoway conversation
a bit tough  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be
required

The only thing that worries me is that  compression  the
SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware but other than that
I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is so I can't
estimate how fast a PC you'd need

This isn't intended to be a flame or anything I am just really curious
how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow

Without getting into the really thorny questions about reverse
engineering and all of that let me just point out that there already
exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse
which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming 
this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device
again ignoring the reverse engineering questions  Speaking from
experience here I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some
six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped the backups were
all bad and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses
Made me appreciate the value of printouts  

So on this point at least there's not so much worry

But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is
really secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself
likely to be secure methinks

	Prof Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted

	CHIP STRUCTURE
	The Clipper Chip contains a classified bit block encryption
	algorithm called Skipjack  The algorithm uses  bit keys compared
	with  for the DES and has  rounds of scrambling compared with 
	for the DES  It supports all  DES modes of operation  Throughput is
	 Mbits a second 

	F an bit family key that is common to all chips
	N a bit serial number
	U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted
		 with the chip
	The key K and message stream M ie digitized voice are then
	fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values

  	   EM K the encrypted message stream and 
	   EEK U  N F a law enforcement block  

Three questions
 It looks like each  bits of input gives you  bits of output
		EMK   bits
		EKU  E  bits    bits
		E EKU N  F   E    bits    bits
   Do you really need to transmit all  bits each time
   or do you only transmit the  bits of wiretap block at the beginning   
   All  would be really obnoxious for bandwidthlimited applications
   like cellular phones or even regular phones over 

 how do the  DES modes interact with the twopart output
   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block
   or also to the wiretap block  Or if the wiretap block is only
   transmitted at the beginning does it get incorporated into
   everything through feedback modes but not during ECB mode

 Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself
   Does the block have to be present at all
   Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U
   it presumably can't check the validity of EKU so it's 
   limited to checking the form of the wiretap block
   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness
   unless there's some sort of backdoor structure that lets
   it recognize a valid EKU
   
   In that case can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT
   wiretap block presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention
   The chip won't do it so you postprocess the output
   Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key
   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number

   On the other hand if I could think of that solution so easily
   presumably the NSA could too  have they done something to block it
   like use message encryption that's really EM KUN

Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted

key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out
by a moderator  Minutes followup comments to other participants
and so on could be posted to the altencrypted group for the use
of the people who attended Communiques intended by the group for
nonattendees could of course just be signed using the private key
but otherwises not encrypted

Starting a altencrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining
mailing lists is better for several reasons  First it would be

who might like to easily read earlier posts second traffic analysis
to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled
three a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize
available privacy measures on the internet

And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such
keys  it beats giving out tshirts as a door prize

Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their
product the manufacturer actually better yet some trusted pair
of escrow agencies has to have the key

Most of us already are in this situationour car makers have keys to our
cars or can get them quickly from the VIN  number and I have no doubt
that if presented with a court order they'd surrender copies to the
government

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks
they've installed and in an emergency can cut keys thus they'd also
provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order

    Of course nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash
and installing it yourself Even modifying the core to match some
arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home I once knew someone who
had fixed his locks in this way  his house office and cars all took
the same key which he took GOOD care of 

The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they
have a court order

Bad analogy

    Very bad yours that is Have you ever had a safety deposit box
They work on a twokey system The bank clerk has one and you have
the other they are different keys The bank does NOT keep a copy of
your key If you lose it they have to drill out the lock and replace
the door This is a time consuming and expensive process which they
will be happy to charge to your account 

     This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which
is NOT in a escrow system and the state having to crack your cipher
to get the data

     Please do not use false analogies

Hmmm this gave me an interesting idea  How about this argument

  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms

  Strong cryptography is arms according to the US government that's
    why it's so hard to export

Therefore we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography  
QED

However it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it
is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly

Although I think a new one might be better but perhaps would take too long
to start up  I would certainly join

  That doesn't worry me at all they're not going to cheat at something
 they can get caught at  And key size is one of the things that can be
 verified externally  Feed lots of random keyinput pairs into the
 chip then see what happens to the output

  If the device is designed to use the key that's registered with the Feds
I don't see how you can feed it a different key  If the user can change
the key to any of the  possibilities the main reason for regarding
this proposal as unacceptable disappears

I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do
However  S and S are supposed to be under control of the same
escrow agents  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure
they can't be trusted to keep the halfkeys secure

I hope there is something I don't understand about this system but can
someone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining
each half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies Don't
both halfs of the key have to come together in some form at the time
the chip is constructed

Or is it built like a fusable prom with the chip being sent to the st
escrow agency to program its  key then the nd agency to program its
 key but who invents the safeguards that prevent the nd agency from
reading the information already programmed by the st

This isn't intended to be a flame or anything I am just really curious
how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow
security without simply saying trust the manufacturer they won't look

The NRA is successful because among a number of things on the drop of
a hat they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards
faxes and phone calls  Certainly with our waycool Internet powers of
organization we can act in the same way if such action is appropriate

As long as we are kept informed of events anyone on this bboard can make
a call to action  Hopefully we're a strong enough community to act on
those calls  I realize this is a little optomistic and I'm glad EFF is

   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that
   some of the bits are much less powerful than others in the sense that
   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game  By contrast
   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible the  output
   change rate appears as early as round   Again though I don't think
   NSA is going to cheat that crudely they're likely to get caught

Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits  and  and
not using either of these bits except through this XOR This system
makes early use of every bit but an exhaustive key search would now
only have  keys to search Your test by varying single key bits
wouldn't turn up anything interesting

   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
   the cryptosystem design  If you assume something DESlike a biased
   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb

The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb but
I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy
which was wellhidden but would still make an exhaustive key search
take far less than  encryptions I don't believe your claim that
the real keysize can be verified externally

   As promised I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington
Times article about the Clipper chip announcement The name of the company
is Secure Communicatiions Technology Information will be given at the end
of this message on how to contact them

   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that
we are More specifically however Mr Bryen of Secure Communications
brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers

   His belief is that ATT was made known of the clipper well before the
rest of the industry This is for several reasons several of which are

  A company of ATT's size could never be able to make a decision to use
   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced

  Months ago they proposed using their own chip for ATT's secure telephone
   devices ATT basically blew them off as being not interested at all
   This stuck them as strange until now


   Also I spoke with Art Melnick their cryptographer he expressed several
concerns over the new Clipper Chip

   The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code

   Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto
    system is lost forever These keys can end up in the hands of any agency
    of the government

   The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm
    is vulnerable over time to an attacker

   The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor But he feels that
    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers or
    changing the keys themselves

   Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and
    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed
    engineered that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very
    difficult to do He feels that they have developed a suitable technique
    to protect the chip from this attack Also he feels that the chip is
    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip

Additonally I spoke with Mr Melnick about their algorithm He couldn't tell
me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet
However he told me a little

  The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been
   granted for it This is so the crypto community can see that it is
   secure

  The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm
   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret
   until the patent was issued but I was told that it will incorporate
   the following

     It will have fast encryption of data Exact specs not given but
      Mr Melnick stated Much faster than what an RS can put out

     It is a symmetric cipher just like IDEA and DES

     It will use  bit data blocks for encryption like DES and IDEA

     The key length was not given to me but Mr Melnick states that
      it is adujustable and is More than adequate for security

     The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form and
      can be ported to many platforms Unlike the the Clipper Chip which
      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software This I
      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use

     The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques
      such as RSA or DiffieHellman This will also be supported in the
      hardware chip

     Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about  dollars
      for each Clipper will run  each chip that is if it is produced
      enough which probably won't happen

     They currently sell a program called CCOM that uses the algorithm
      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted
      data into blocks This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know
      what the block header is This program operates at all supported
      RS speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm

     Most importantly IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR



Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out
of business This is a very real possibility So they really need help in
stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard If you want to contact
them they can be reached at

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down K  I think it is I've heard it's not  Lets
say  bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

Note I am not a cable freak so I might have completely
misunderstood what you said  Also my math is frequently noted for
being wrong so you'll better check the calculations yourself

I assume that K means K Bits  So if we assume one start and
one stopbit and no protocol overhead the effective number of bytes
per second is K

Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in
stereo so that you can send  samplessec  This corresponds to a
Nyquist frequency of  Hz which should be too low especially if
you think about the bit low quality sound  Furthermore your DA
converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been
cut off at  Hz but will instead alias in all the higher
frequencies  Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome
that problem

On the other hand speech should be easily compressible  For example
you could form power spectra or you could simply bandpass filter and
then linearize the fourier transforms  It won't be CD quality sound
but it'll be discernible  The power spectrum method is very good in
that respect  I have once programmed such a software compressor and
compression rates of  with relative errors due to linearization of
less than  were common  Although I must say that these were musical
sounds not speech

Have fun

One more time

    If they released the algorithm it would be possible for someone
    to come up with an implementation which was identical but
    lacking an escrowed key

    Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was
    being kept secret for security of the key escrow system  In this
    case security means an escrowed key for EVERY clipper chip


    Assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of
    the algorithm and the escrow system which would you buy 

     a  Chip from firm A with the escrowed key
     b  Second source chip from reputable firm B with no key
          in government escrow

    There would obviously be powerful economic incentives for a second
    source non escrowed vendor

But what about second sources for pincompatible nonClipper algorithm
chips that also have escrowed keys  If a reputable firm produces a
chip with escrowed key that is a popin replacement for the Clipper
chip in my phone and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated
and trusted then what's the problem

The Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization
with sufficient resources can you say billions of cocaine dollars so
those drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the
cracks  We lawabiding nonincrediblywealthy citizens naturally will
not have this recourse  But claiming that the algorithm can't be
released to prevent people from using nonkeyescrowed chips is plain
deceitful analysis of the chip output will provide information on
the necessary headers and whatnot so the bad guys could build chips
using a different algorithm and still not escrow their keys

Or they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at Kmart every week
and play SwaptheClipperChip with their cellular phone every day

As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto they are trying to coopt it Their contention that they 
need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm More likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont 
have the keys registered Anyone else notice that in their QA session they

Preventing black market chips wnonescrowed keys IS exactly what they
mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system  There are
two parts to the security of such a system
  
    a Preventing decruption by unauthorized personel
    b Assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper
        traffic when it authorizes itself to do so

Of course the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about

I believe the NSA has identical motivations with respect to my activities

 Let's assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
 you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
 escrow houses  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses  one is
 the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And I'm not entirely joking about
 those two names

The problem with Let's assume reasoning is that taken to the extreme
and you're close you arrive at Let's assume this is perfectly OK

The assumptions you make are big ones If the system is really secure then
why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret  There are plenty
of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure
so why in the world use one that does  There are reasons of course but
I certainly can't think of any honest ones

Next you assume we can trust the escrow houses But the last time I checked
EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure
corruption and even fabrication of supposedly secure data The govt is
saying Yeah but NOW we're serious so you can trust us  Bullcrypt 

And finally although you didn't state it explicitly you implicitly assume
that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable The case
in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately
fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this
score

Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers right  As others
have pointed out the current proposal will if deployed render truly secure
encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand
Who will be able to afford and be sufficiently motivated to purchase this
expensive inconvenient higher protection  Somebody with lots of extra
cash

The following is more true than ever

  When strong encryption is outlawed only outlaws will have strong
encryption

 Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
 one Make it voluntary
 
 That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
 to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own
 

David

  As an economist I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic If the naive
market is flooded with proprietary but weak encryption then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast
standard and then sold TVs below cost Private industry has a better standard
but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market
with cheap proprietary sets Even though the industry's technology is better
the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard
Who could compete

  The other flaw of course is that making something voluntary today ensures
that it will be voluntary in the future I went to renew my CA drivers license
last week and was required not only to give my SSN but to PRODUCE AN SSN
CARD to veryify the number  Note that a federal law once said that no state
or local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration
specifically

   I do not trust the govt that says trust me on this even though we could
have an arrangement that doesn't require your trust  Something is big
time fishy If you look more carefully you'll see it

 Interestingly enough in designing the escrow we may want to use some
 rather unusual technology such as sealed boxes of paper or
 destructive read memory rather than typical computer databases which
 is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys
 

To me a larger problem is that once disclosed your keys could be used
to decrypt any previously recorded conversations I gather that from this
proposal a warrant would be required to get the keys but not to collect
conversations Consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively
all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets and
not necessarily legitimate targets then arranges for some unrelated
incident that can trigger a warrant

   Your honor we know that the suspect has received calls from noted 
crime figure Bugsy Butthead said calls arranged by the agency and we must 
therefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect in a
sensitive govt post is corrupt

  I suppose that it is conceivable that there are session keys involved
somewhere but that doesn't seem likely if there are why wouldn't the
technical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the number
of bits held by each escrow authority

  This scheme is full of holes and stinks to high heaven

The chip and algorithm are classified  If you reverse engineer it and
tell people you are likely to go to jail

I don't find this a credible argument for two reasons  One you have
supplied below unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the
future eg the Taiwanese backyard cloners  who BTW have been known to
decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating
highprofit arcade machines and the like  who wouldn't care less I am not 
going to care much about US confidentiality am I  Only people like the
real me who does care about travelling to various countries for business
reasons will sit up and follow laws like this but I would contend that
we're not the main threat

I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon
could possibly be called classified  It's like handing out military
secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked don't open me  I can
imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to
a trial  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions

Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by
cracking the system outside the USA  The US government could probably
stop importation of clone hardware but a software implementation
should be practical

Amusing thought could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable
for a fast software implementation but which is easy in custom hardware
In DES the extensive use of permutation tables trivial in hardware you
just swap bus lines but relatively slow in software have had a big effect
on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of
that cipher indeed I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that
it would be and approved  Certain algorythms usually parallel search
algorythms can be very slow in software yet can fly in custom hardware
I have no proof of their employment in Clipper  it is pure conjecture  
However as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its 
designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs then the inclusion 
of such techniques seems credible

Hmmm I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name
Clipper for this device

  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread Any back
doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme and help grow
the market demand for a secure alternative

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of
the discussion one the dice are out there it won't be long before someone
decaps it and after a bit of work has full details of the Clipper
algorythm  This isn't trivial to do but then again it is not impossibly
difficult either  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able
to take a photograph of a technology she is familiar with and given a
description of the input output control and supply lines figure out 
the function of various subsystems on the die  Indeed this is not an
uncommon exercise performed during training because it makes you think
about design decisions made by other designers

I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using
tamperproof carriers unlikely  such techniques are very expensive
and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce or that
there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication
of the algorythm unlikely  please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these
supposed to be sold internationally  I suppose that the most likely
reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot
bureaucrat untrammeled by the realities of the situation decided that
well we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret
isn't it

Just some random thoughts

	I really like these claims Where did they come from We hear
practically daily that the NSA monitors oh everything They can
crack anything They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack

	Where do people get these fascinating facts 'The Puzzle Palace'
If you can get it for a buck nd hand it must be true eh I'm pretty
sure the NSA is supposed to among many other things provide highquality
cryptosystems to a variety of places I don't recall reading anywhere
reliable that they're supposed to

	 Monitor my phonecalls
	 Monitor usenet
	 Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack
	 etc etc

	This is not to say that they don't they might But you don't
know that they do and you have no evidence that they do for almost
all values of you It follows therefore that for most values of 'you'
your claims about the NSA border on paranoia

Having read the various Clipper announcements on the net over the last few 
days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip its uses
government plots etc I have the following questions

   What does the Clipper chip actually implement Just the Skipjack
	cryptographic algorithm Or does it also implement a chip to chip
	communications protocol If it does implement a communications
	protocol can it be used as just a crypt chip also

   Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained

   Who may purchase them and under what conditions

   Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system

   The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does
	not appear to require that the Family key be a secret Why is
	it a secret What happens when the family key becomes well known
	If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult does
	the Law enforcement message contain any random information
	How much and how random is it

   Can the chip be programmed to reveal the Unit key The chip serial
	number Any of the programming parameters

Agreed  Remember I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real 
senseif I did I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it

I agree with this assessment  Furthermore its promotion as
providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true as far
as it goes  However the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal
of letting LE wiretap terrorists and drug dealers is to restrict
stronger techniques  

Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption weak encryption or
the vast majority no encryption  The latter two classes can be
tapped  With weak encryption in every phone the noencryption
class is merged into the weakencryption class  Will the
introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong
privacy to give up on it  that is to rely for privacy on a system
expressly designed to deny it to people like them  I doubt it  The
mere introduction of this scheme will give the government nothing

The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping
capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic
cryptography and only by this restriction  Clipper appears to be
no more than a sop given to the public to mute any complaints  We
would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff but I fear the public
at large will not care  I hate to even mention gun control but
most people seem to think that an assault weapon' as the NYT uses
the word is some sort of automatic weapon  caliber maybe  Who
wants to have such a thing legal  Well people know even less about
cryptology I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be
labeled too much secrecy for lawabiding citizens to need

That's not for Clinton or anyone under him to say though  Only the 
federal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality
Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at 
best

What they say is opinion but what they do is what matters and will
continue unless overturned  And the courts are reluctant to annul
law or regulation going to some length to decide cases on other
grounds  Furthermore Congress can get away with quite a bit  They
could levy a burdensome tax this would place enforcement in the
hands of the BATF who as we've seen you really don't want on your
case  They could invoke the Commerce Clause this seems most
likely  This clause will get you anywhere these days  The th was
required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute
unconstitutional  In  Congress prohibited many drugs with a
textual nod to the Commerce Clause  The Controlled Substances
Act of  still stands  I think the government could get away
with it

Wouldn't a a second monitor of similar type scrolling gibberish and adjacent
to the one being used provide reasonable resistance to tempest attacks

It would be in a different location so a directional antenna could
probably lock in on just the one monitor Failing that a phased array
could likely seperate the signals Admittedly this is expensive but
so is all the rest of this stuff anyway

Further the Attorney General

   good post describing what is in store for us deleted  

It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that
Clinton would have the plumbers out in force shortly  Clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control  Anytime a
leader believes in that the leader will use every means possible to retain
that control and take more

WE have to take OUR government back  Otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a hightech third world dictatorship  We have to take
responsibility for ourselves our personal welfare and our actions

I totally agree  But how do you propose we take government back  They
obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is
responsibile for what a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip
release to see what the entity 'clipper' was and got a few lists
BUt when another person tried a bit later the commands were disabled
Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability
or information they don't control given to the people  The secret
development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further
backs that up  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software
will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture
along with the systems that are running it  YOU WATCH SEE IF I AM WRONG

The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking
it back  And they have all the resources unlimited access to the media
for propeganda and almost all the guns soon to be ALL the guns if
Clinton's agenda succeeds   Those that do not play ball  Waco
might be a good example of what to expect  The warrant just released
stated the reason for the raid was the BDs spent a very large sum
for weapons over an undetermined amount of time  I don't recall
spending a lot of money on guns etc being illegal  yet that is

Clinton might go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to
the US of A  Now to be known as the 'Peoples Socalist Democratic
Republic of America'  PSDRA

So don't just think of replacements for clipper also think of front
ends

This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative nonescrowed
encryption schemes Otherwise why not just use the front end without
clipper

Because that will make private encryption stick out like a sore thumb
and the government will start to take a sharp interest in everything you
do

If the Clinton Clipper is so very good 

Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do
with the design implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind
any moves being made using this chip as a pawn

Uh I notice he has not either asked for or allowed public input and he damn
sure has not stopped it

Remember when you elect a president of the united states it's not
the case that all the Republicans etc in the NSA and FBI and CIA
immediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young
Democrats  Most of the government  say   is appointed or
hired rather than elected  Since this Clipper device has been in
production for over six months it probably has little or no 
foundation in the currently elected Democratic Executive body

Again if it was something Clinton didn't like how come he did not
stop it or get PUBLIC input before implimenting the DECISION  He
sure has asserted his authority on other things he did not agree with
from the Bush administrationk I notice   He is the president therefore
he is RESPONSIBLE for the actions of the Execuitive Branch  I have
not the slightest bit of doubt you would be holding Bush or Reagan
to that standard had they been in office when this thing was cast into
stone

BTW  those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton believe
this  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights
under the Constitution or Bill of Rights  The last couple of decades
have been a nonstop series of endruns around the protections of the
Constitution  It has to stop  Now is as good a time as any if it
isn't too late allready

Could be  However the sky hasn't fallen yet Chicken Little

Thanks for the namecalling  That really makes your position higly
credible  Lenin had a term for folks with your outlook  Do you REALLY
have THAT MUCH faith in the trustworthiness and honesty of the government
that is primarily concerned with people control   I suspect you will
be in for an unpleasant surprise  I would just as soon see this nipped
in the bud whileif it still can be done instead of waiting for yet
more abridgements of our Bill of Rights thank you

 fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege  Don't give up the

 figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through

It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever
administration is current for things they couldn't possibly have
initiated  This chip had to take years to develop yet already
we're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us
Bullshit  The Bush administration and the career Gestapo were
responsible for this horror and the careerists presented it to the
new presidency as a fait accompli  That doesn't excuse Clinton and
Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it but let's lay
the body at the proper door to start with

You are so correct  Clinton did not initiate it  He just cast it in
GRANITE by implimenting NOT stopping the DECISION  I also stated in another
post I don't give a damn what administration does it I still find it
totally unacceptable and whoever impliments it or rams it down our throats
ought to be run out of office

Also Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights
Clinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard  That reveals a total difference
in philosophy  Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people
control  Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it no real security
for the common person and no ability to defend oneself against illegal
attack from whatever source  Trust us we will protect and control
you if we don't find it inconvenient

Clinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and
accountability as well  He had plenty of time to change the policy

HE DIDN'T  HE EXPANDED ON IT

I bet had Bush been in office you would be in there howling louder
than I

Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors
and provides some additional information and explanation


                     THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                           Revised April  


INTRODUCTION

On April  the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement  At the heart of the plan is a new tamperproof encryption
chip called the Clipper Chip together with a splitkey approach to
escrowing keys  Two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key


CHIP CONTENTS

The Clipper Chip contains a classified singlekey bit block
encryption algorithm called Skipjack  The algorithm uses  bit keys
compared with  for the DES and has  rounds of scrambling
compared with  for the DES  It supports all  DES modes of
operation  The algorithm takes  clock ticks and in Electronic
Codebook ECB mode runs at  Mbits per second

Each chip includes the following components

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F an bit family key that is common to all chips
   N a bit serial number this length is subject to change
   U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx Inc which calls them the
MYK  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc  They are
implemented in  micron technology and will initially sell for about
 each in quantities of  or more  The price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to  micron


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the ATT
telephone security device as it will be  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key K
with the device at the other end  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip  In general any method of key exchange can
be used such as the DiffieHellman publickey distribution method

Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M digitized voice  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values

   EM K the encrypted message stream and 
   EEK U  N F a law enforcement field  

which are transmitted over the telephone line  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family
key F  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed

The ciphertext EM K is decrypted by the receiver's device using the
session key

   DEM K K  M 


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF Secure Compartmented
Information Facility which is essentially a vault  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips  About  chips
are programmed during a single session  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx

At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault  Agent  enters a secret random
bit value S into the laptop and agent  enters a secret random
bit value S These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers  Thus the unit keys are a
function of  secret random bits where each agent knows only 
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N the bit value N is
first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block N
S and S are then used as keys to tripleencrypt N producing a
bit block R

        R  EDEN S S S 

Similarly N is padded with two other bit blocks to produce N and
N and two additional bit blocks R and R are computed  

        R  EDEN S S S 
        R  EDEN S S S 

R R and R are then concatenated together giving  bits The
first  bits are assigned to U and the second  bits to U  The
rest are discarded  The unit key U is the XOR of U and U  U and U
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies

As a sequence of values for U U and U are generated they are
written onto three separate floppy disks  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U  The second disk is similar but contains the U values  The third
disk contains the unit keys U  Agent  takes the first disk and agent
 takes the second disk  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an bit seed and the bit key parts  However the agent does not
know the other  bits used to generate the keys or the other bit
key parts  

The third disk is used to program the chips  After the chips are
programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two  The first two would provide the seeds S and S
and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies 

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not
be the NSA CIA FBI or any other law enforcement agency  One or
both may be independent from the government


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
Clipper Chip  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F giving EK U  N  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent eg via secure FAX to each of the key escrow agents who
return eg also via secure FAX U and U  U and U are XORed
together to produce the unit key U and EK U is decrypted to get the
session key K  Finally the message stream is decrypted  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder


CAPSTONE THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the Clipper Chip called Capstone by the government
and MYK by Mykotronx has already been developed  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm the Digital Signature Standard DSS the
Secure Hash Algorithm SHA a method of key exchange a fast
exponentiator and a randomizer  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April  and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July

Exactly

But I'll add another observation if the chip does become a standard
the algorithm won't remain secret

Leaving the government with the only remaining option to make use
of unescrowed keys illegal Which won't begin to bother the terrorists
and child abusers the government is so fond of referring to

Note that the Federalist papers stress one reason for the right
of citizens to bear arms to defend themselves against the army
Our army

IMHO the primary purpose of private crypto is defend ourselves
against the government The odd terrorist I'm not worried about
the goverment damages my quality of life every day

A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to US law enforcement agencies  In   US
wiretaps led to  arrests while total police expenditures of 
billion led to  million arrests ref US Statistical Abstracts
I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but

You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value and that
the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them

Given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps and the associated
difficulty and cost involved judges technicians etc I expect that
law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable
cases  Since the value of an arrest can vary over an enormous range
eg jaywalking  mass murder I think your  million estimate may
be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude

	After reading the debate over the Clipper I have a few things to
add

	First most of the people I know who activly use encryption
privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate
and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US All they
care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not That
after all IS the bottom line 

	Second if I look at all the people I know who use any form
of encryption at all and this group spans people from the morons who
still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard to people 
looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies I can not think
of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves
their methods open to abuse The Clipper does this because people make
mistakes by nature and the US government is made up of people who are
just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else 

	Third since most of the people I know are at least marginaly
familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption
stratigies I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that
someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip
That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it So I can 
not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip

	Fourth when it comes to criminal abuse sure there are many stupid
people out there And yes some will be open to being caught via the 
built in back door of the Clipper Chip However anyone who is going to
do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going
to run into that problem pretty damned fast and I would assume start
looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption 


	If nothing else were avalible none of this would be an issue However
the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into
simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything
else If it works they use it This is not going to change either I do
not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be
slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip It is all to easy to 
convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is if anything
the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user


	The bottom line here is that people will use what works and
unavoidibly I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption
related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty
charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy
	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide 
useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is
out of the bag Or if you have an interest in snooping Pandora's Box
has been opened and this is not going to change I've seen a blindness
to this that I've found utterly stunning and the Clipper Chip along
with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger
degree

From Denning

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F an bit family key that is common to all chips
   N a bit serial number
   U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

   EM K the encrypted message stream and 
   EEK U  N F a law enforcement block  

Where the session key is K and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U
Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F

Presumably the protocol can be recovered if by nothing else differential
analysis

Postulate if you will a chip or logic sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel  The function of this spoof chip is twofold
    
	 Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the  bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the family key

	 Receive Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable assuming integrity of the
	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation 
	    checksums sequence control etc

This has the net result of hiding the serial number  It is probable theere is
a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N  bits
as used in generating U UU correctness of the law enforcement block
can be determined with only the family key F  Whereas no one has proposed
Federal Agencies be denied F and because they could recover it themselves
The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits
of N in EN F

The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above but the
mutilation could be detected  A better approach would be to mutilate the
entire law enforcement block  If it were done with a group encryption scheme
such as DES or presumably Skipjack the chances the law enforcement block
can be recovered are lessened

What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the
serial numbers decrypted in a target search  When digital transmission
becomes widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol
transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks

One way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block
containing M as well as spoofing the law enforcement block

The goal is to use a secure communications scheme without redress to 
detection or key K interception contained encrypted within the law
enforcement block  The data stream is returned to its original state
for use by the clipper chip or system if required for proper operation

It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within
the clipper chip yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for
requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting
and decrypting EM K

The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols including
on the resulting serial data stream  Existing clipper products could
be subborned  After all they are high security encryption systems right

Super enciphermentencryption could allow the chip to be used without
redress to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial
number  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should
not be recoverable by other means  One can see the use of cut outs for
procurring clipper phones or once the number of units is high enough
stealing them  It would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice
from a point of privacy if the serial number N were not associated with
a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and 
distribution process  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen
clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F and the protocols are not 
sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream
This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or
spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted
stream

Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned
scheme



If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own and use
them in a codebook sustitution with your own where they point to a valid
law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching
the remainder of the transmission you could simply out and out lie yet
deliver to monitoring andor hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement
block   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators
such as in a manually keyed encryption system  Fending this off would require
escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission

The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of
clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext  This could be invalidated
by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream
and the actual transmitted stream under the control of a secure key
generator synchronized between endpoints

The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited
based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission
interception  You would need a large number of them but hey there's
supposed to be millions of these things right  Adding time stamps to
the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical who wants
an encryption chip with a real time clock



The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated

I just had the thought that you could capture your own law enforcement blocks
for session keys K that you will not use in actual transmissions as

d denning just sent out further information of a new version of the clipper
chip	If a hash function were to be embedded in a clipper M transmission
block reflecting the law enforcement block it better not fall on  bit block
boundaries  If it were a recognizeable datum you could lie with it too

I like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK  I remember reading that
Intel had an approved random noise source on silicon hence the ability
to put it Inside

You ever think that Mykotronx sounds like one of those made up names of 
companies used as fronts for intelligence organizations

My earlier argument that Clipper will encourage state and local cops 
to commit criminal acts is largely moot now that we've learned that 
the FBI will perform the actual tap  It will encourage the FBI to
commit even more criminal acts but that's not the point here

But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal  When
the EFFACLUCPSR FOIA requests are made they should ask for details
on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed or 
even already budgeted for the FBI to service tapping requests  for now
and the projected future 

From these figures estimate the number of Clippertap requests the FBI
is expecting  Publish this figure  Compare it on a percapita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected

Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more
Clippertapping stations and how rapidly they could be built and
installed  ie get the plus or minus epsilon for the near future

Might be a mite disturbing for J Q Public to know these things

And despite all the technical details BTW thanks to those who've been
providing them we still don't know 

 how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated though
   it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme

 how the results will be securely transmitted Fed Ex the audio tapes

 how privacy will be reestablished when an investigation is complete

 Do you know of any freely distributable c or c code for public
 key cryptography such as RSA  

 I've tried various archie searches to no avail  

Have you heard of PGP I assume from your post that you have not PGP 
is a freeware RSA encryption program which includes digital signatures and
comprehensive key management facilities Most sites also keep the source code
A growing number of people are using this excellent software to encrypt to
a very high standard their email and data Get it before Clinton outlaws it

Two of the many sites are
      rsacom     pubpgp
      sodaberkeleyedu      pubcypherpunkspgp

PGP is not available on the archive site rsacom  If it were it
would be highly amusing since rsacom actually Public Key Partners
but it's the same entity is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually make use or sell PGP
I believe those patents also apply in Canada but I'm not a patent
lawyer or anything

There is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which
can be used in North America without legal entanglements  You may
wish to consider RSAREF however which is available from the FTP
site rsacom in rsaref but probably doesn't meet your definition of
freely redistributable it's readily available in source in C and
does RSA MD etc and comes with a license allowing noncommercial
use  Like any other strong crypto software it's not exportable
legally  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI which a
number of people have received in the past  For reasons that aren't
entirely clear to me RSA says that only US people should take
RSAREF from its server although there aren't ITAR issues regarding
Canada  The RIPEM distribution site ripemmsuedu has RSAREF in its
distribution and is OK for Canadians

 Here is a revised version of my summary that corrects some errors and
 provides some additional information and explanation

Thank you very much After reading the text some distinct questions
arised to me which I guess will also be asked by other people Perhaps
would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions 


                      THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
    N a bit serial number this length is subject to change

shorter or longer 

 Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to
 encrypt the conversation or message stream M digitized voice  The
 telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
 values

    EM K the encrypted message stream and
    EEK U  N F a law enforcement field 

 which are transmitted over the telephone line  The law enforcement
 field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
 concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family
 key F  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
 an authorized wiretap has been installed

First question When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted and how
does the remote Clipper Chip handle it Is it transmitted periodically
in the stream of encrypted blocks or just at the beginning  Does the
phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever
or tries it to turn them into voiceoutput  Which would not be disturbing


 At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key
 escrow agencies enters the vault  Agent  enters a secret random
 bit value S into the laptop and agent  enters a secret random
 bit value S These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
 keys for a sequence of serial numbers  Thus the unit keys are a
 function of  secret random bits where each agent knows only 

Second question Why Why is such a strange procedure used and not
a real RNG  This turns those SS in a kind of bottleneck for system
security


 When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they
 will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
 access to the communications line  Let us assume that the tap is in
 place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
 Clipper Chip  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
 family key F giving EK U  N  Documentation certifying that a tap
 has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
 then sent eg via secure FAX to each of the key escrow agents who
 return eg also via secure FAX U and U  U and U are XORed
 together to produce the unit key U and EK U is decrypted to get the
 session key K  Finally the message stream is decrypted  All this will
 be accomplished through a special black box decoder

So no technical provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these
warrants This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical
restriction by letting the escrowagencies perform the decoding of the
session key Just take modemlines instead of secure fax Is this such
a bad idea 


 A successor to the Clipper Chip called Capstone by the government
 and MYK by Mykotronx has already been developed  It will include
 the Skipjack algorithm the Digital Signature Standard DSS the
 Secure Hash Algorithm SHA a method of key exchange a fast
 exponentiator and a randomizer  A prototoype will be available for
 testing on April  and the chips are expected to be ready for
 delivery in June or July

Wow How does the randomizer work Are the SHA and Key exchange secret
or publicly known  KeyExchange is DH I guess 

It seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time
your government realy means to act

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish
but there are certainly exceptions  If you write a paper which includes
sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon it is
classified  As I understand the law nuclear weapons design is
automatically classified even if you do the work yourself  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper

	Hate to mess up your point but it is incredibly easy to learn how
to make a nuclear weapon  The hard part is getting the radioactives to
put in it  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's The Sum of All Fears  It
describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a
nuclear bomb using stolen actually found plutonium with some help from
an East German nuclear physicist  For some non fiction read Tom Clancy's
article Five Minutes Till Midnight  It shows how a terrorist group could
construct a nuke using Neptunium a low grade radioactive waste product
dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about  He also claims information
on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library  Sounds
kind of scary doesn't it 

A less serious example if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are
about to run into you can be fined even though you might argue that you
broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman  The charge
is interfering with a police officer which is quite similar what you would
be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip

Don't tell me that you think this violates the Constitution  find some
court cases which have struck down such laws  Many people would not be
comforted by the fact that the government violated their rights when it
imprisoned them


	Don't know whether you could get busted for warning of a speedtrap

 Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals

Assume in this case the usual canardadversary of narcotraficantes  They
probably have more cash than the KGB did and they're probably more generous

   Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
   one Make it voluntary

   That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
   to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

That's the disturbing part  use of other products IS voluntary for now
and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to
decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear
and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as
they provide key escrow services  That's a clear implication that
they're considering banning alternatives

Additionally use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal 
you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to
the government's friends eg the Australian government
you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission
and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make
sure there are only two competitors so Joe's Garage Cellular can't
start offering a secure service

   Finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in
   realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments
   there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications
   in the network for expostfacto scrutiny once some criminal act is
   discovered and the instruments involved have been identified

All is a very big number  The ATT Long Distance network has
around  T trunks  Mbitsec which is on the order of  bitssec
That doesn't even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies
or our longdistance competitors  It's about  Exabytes tapes  second
which is pretty large even for the NSA 

On the other hand I can easily see them recording the traffic for
interesting people such as dissidents suspected criminals
foreign telephone calls and anybody noticed using encryption
As Ken Shiriff speculates recording encrypted traffic will probably
be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon

  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the
FUD Fear Uncertainty Doubt factor
  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole
debate only vaguely  the government says it's solid other people in the
field say it's Swiss cheese  the balance of doubt could shift against the
Feds  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented
as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from
superior competition

I know DES is  bits tripple DES is  bits and IDEA is  bits  Is
there anything made in the US that has  bit keys  Anything anywhere
that has larger keys  I've heard that RC can be scaled to arbitrarily
large keys but is this actually implemented anywhere

My MDC cipher which uses any oneway hash function as a CFBmode stream
cipher the current implementation uses MD uses a key of up to  bits
that is you can use a bit key if you want and copy it over the entire
bit range or you can use the entire  bits  Runtime is
independant of key size the system runs slightly slower than MD itself
I presume RC and RC use a similar system or possibly they just hash an
arbitrarylength key down to n bits maybe  using something like MD

the date I have for this is 

note Clinton's statements about encryption in the rd paragraph  I guess
this statement doesen't contradict what you said though

 cut here 

        WASHINGTON UPI  The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
start President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation
of Police Commisioners convention in Washington
        In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural
Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War would make
everything so far seem so halfhearted that for all practical
purposes this war is only beginning now'' He repeatedly emphasized
his view that regardless of what has been tried or who has tried
it or how long they've been trying it this is Day One to me''
The audience at the convention whose theme is How do we spell
fiscal relief  FORFEITURE'' interrupted Clinton frequently
with applause
        Clinton's program presented in the speech follows the
outline given in his campaign position papers a cabinetlevel Drug
Czar and boot camps'' for firsttime youthful offenders  He did
however cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement
methods  This year's crime bill will have teeth not bare gums''
Clinton said  In particular his administration will place strict
controls on data formats and protocols and require the registration
of socalled cryptographic keys'' in the hope of denying drug
dealers the ability to communicate in secret  Clinton said the
approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground
economic activity such as the deficitcausing tax evaders who
live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren''
        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won
because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last
November everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of
urgency about fighting the drug menace  The advocates of
legalization  the advocates of surrender  may be very good at
making noise'' Clinton said  But when the American people cast
their ballots it only proved what I knew all along  that the
advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe''

Just doing a quick reality check here  is this for real or did someone
invent it to provoke a reaction from people  It sounds more like the
sort of thing you'd have heard suitably rephrased from the leader of a 
certain German political party in the 's

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down K  I think it is I've heard it's not  Lets
say  bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

It's all easy with a DSP The Olivetti Quaderno for example great kg
subnotebookpalmtop PC  sorry for the plug folks but Olivetti don't
seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves  includes sound
digitisation hardware they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce
varous bitrates There's one which gives pretty acceptable voice
quality at Kbitsec just right for a Vbis modem

Their DSP can play and record at the same time too  so you wouldn't
need to play twowayradio You can also download code to the DSP
subunit though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in 
question dunno which it is if you wanted to produce your own 
vocoder for say V speeds

Hmmm We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial
number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U and U
is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government 
U is completedly determined given S S and N 
 
If S and S do not change even if they remain secret I wonder if
they can somehow be backderived given enough unit keyserial number
pairs 

Maybe  such pairs suffice to reconstruct S and S By such a back
door in the encryption algorithm perhaps it would be possible for  
the manufacturer to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in 
one session This would not btw enable anybody else to retrieve the 
keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of  NU 
pairs with identical S and S Note that these have to be constant 
for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure ie they 
have to be typed in manually by the random number supplying agents'

And I was wondering why they'll always do  chips in one session  
Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the 
production of every chip at least three persons for one hour each 
plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular 
Hollywoodlike bonfire add travelling expenses drinks and lighting 
divide the sum by  there won't be a larger demand  not from the 
private sector anyway 

And let me mention one other thought that certainly has occurred to all 
the notoriously paranoid people in this group before Who is going to 
verify that no interested party will perform tempest attacks on the 
vault

 Wouldn't a a second monitor of similar type scrolling gibberish and adjacent

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here and there's no difficulty in
picking up individual monitors Their engineering tolerances are slack enough
that they tend to radiate on different frequencies Even where they overlap you
can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies  you can
lock in on one and average the others out

The signals are weird in any case with varying polarisations and all sorts
of interactions with the building Just moving a folded dipole around is also
highly effective as a randomised means of switching from one monitor to
another

Hell just set up a spark jammer or some other very electricallynoisy
device Or build an active Farrady cage around the room with a noise
signal piped into it While these measures will not totally mask the
emissions of your equipment they will provide sufficient interference to
make remote monitoring a chancy proposition at best There is of course
the consideration that these measures may and almost cretainly will
cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems It's a matter
of balancing security versus convenience

The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack  
against DES is quite feasible now But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB  
mode where one chooses a random init vector of  bytes Questions

  Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key Then we have  
a      bit key
 
  If yes Is anything known about the security of this key scheme Can we  
break it faster than by exhaustive search through the  bit key space

Mr Ward before you start blathering about your skill interpreting
the Constitution it might be helpful to learn to read  After a review
with a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases you
might start with the Second Amendment and follow it up with

 th Congress nd Session Committee Print The Right To Keep and
 Bear Arms of the Subcomittee on the Constitution of the Committee on
 the Judiciary United States Senate th Congress Second Session
 February   GPO No O

This authoritative heavily researched and annotated document clearly
turns your interpretation into specious claptrap which is a polite
way of saying utter bullshit  In spite of your false assertion to the
contrary the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individual
citizen in his capacity as an individual to keep and bear arms

And Mr Holland IMHO blatantly and harmfully false information
asserted as fact and globally distributed deserves globally
distributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted

And besides this site doesn't carry tpg

If I forgot doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like consider
this alternative  Somewhere on the hard disk duplicated a few times
keep a bit random number  When the bit digest of your
passphrase is computed it is XORred with the random number before being
used as the key for your hard disk  Writing random junk over the random
numbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone

Now if you were merely to claim that you have written random junk
over the XOR key noone would be able to tell whether or not you were
telling the truth  This is a perjury and b vunerable to

I'm quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal 
assault on emerging American freedoms  The Clinton administration 
nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever 
in regulating cryptography To do so is tantamount to regulating 
acceptable' speech and is blatantly unconstitutional Perhaps we 
should rename this year ' in honor of such an illustrious 
proposal  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy and the adminstration
receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure

IMHO encryption is also protected under the SECOND amendment of
the Constitution of the United States


I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology
to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures  The US
government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any
serious threat to my liberties such as this and I call on everyone
with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this 
proposal  The administration does not seem to understand that they
are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the
public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is 
wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty

I am not surprised that this administration is doing this
I could have told you so


Cryptography is neutral technology If everybody has strong 
cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen 
housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable 
equilibrium  Anything less is an unworkable antiegaltarian 
arrangement intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms and
guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent 
impracticality We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom

Privacy has ALWAYS been something that has the effect of restricting
out ability to prosecute criminals  We are supposed to have the
presumption of innocence

I have the right to pull the curtains over my windows and close my
door and the police may not come in  If I perform a crim in my home
they will have to find out by means other than simply looking

Encryption is to my data as the window curtains are to my home
Simple enough


For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be 
increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality 
and protecting Americans

And yet the people vote for these people because they come out a lie
to them about promising to fix things


The administration has to be committed to leaving private 
industries alone esp on this issue  The government has no 
legitimate role in regulating the content of communications
Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their
surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be 
disarmed of it 

You mean they might have to go back to actually WORKING to do their job
Oh heavens


No such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent
to a veiled threat which I don't appreciate  This kind of 
extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism I will
trade threats for threats and violation for violation

Perhaps the FIRST amendment  Definitely the SECOND and FIFTH


If the administration did say this it would find itself 
impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential
established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy 
guarantees The administration would have no legal standing 
whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and
criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast 
segments of the population

Unfortunately the vast segments of the population are misinformed
They just haven't appended SR to the name of out country yet


This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie  The two aims of
privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally 
incompatible and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise 
Americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology 
to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly 
been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and 
unrepresentative government

I seriously doubt that the NSA thinks that privacy and surveillance are
compatible  I doubt of any smart person in any other agency thinks

In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts I've tossing back and
forth  

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this

The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
In a new Civil War 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and I'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it  Examine your
history books and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
or Democratic style governments  I think you'll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history

That's not very good odds  

Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack  It is not meant to be used in
agression  This is the difference between selfdefence and murder

Let's try to avoid killing things eh  There's enough blood shed in the
world without adding a couple of riots Civil Wars etc

I'm probably overreacting  But what I've read scared me a lot  I don't
want my children growing up in a War Zone

 Wouldn't a a second monitor of similar type scrolling gibberish and adjacent
 to the one being used provide reasonable resistance to tempest attacks

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here and there's no difficulty in
picking up individual monitors Their engineering tolerances are slack enough
that they tend to radiate on different frequencies Even where they overlap you
can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies  you can
lock in on one and average the others out

The signals are weird in any case with varying polarisations and all sorts
of interactions with the building Just moving a folded dipole around is also
highly effective as a randomised means of switching from one monitor to
another

 First note that the experts will only look at details and of just 
 the algorithm
 
     In addition respected experts from outside the
     government will be offered access to the confidential details of
     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
     their findings
 
 Why not the chip design  Well here's the possiblity  in addition to
 encryption the chip preprocesses voice signals to make them easier
 to analyzetranscribe electronically  The chip once widespread might
 effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for voice
 grepping the US phone network or the criminal  wrongthinking patrons
 thereof

First of all the chip doesn't do that  It runs at  megabitssecond
which is far beyond what you need for voice  It's obviously intended
for data as well and on highspeed lines at that

Second  what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone
I don't care how fancy that chip is it's not as fancy as the roomful
of analyzers at Fort Meade running the program they'll have  years from
now  They can't update every Clipper chip that's out there

Third  if they did do this preprocessing in the chip it would probably
have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns  If
nothing else that would hurt the acceptability of the product  The
Vbis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly
massaged voice as is add any more to the mix and you're completely out
of the ballpark

  Second question Why Why is such a strange procedure used and not
 a real RNG  This turns those SS in a kind of bottleneck for system
 security

  The only theory that makes any sense is that S and S are either the
same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers  about one billion multiplied by the number
of different S S combinations

 It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
 would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
 probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court
Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones record
calls without listening to them and then postfacto obtain warrants
and listen to calls after probable cause is established  But this
strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court  At least not
in the near term

In other words near as I can tell the thing that makes such evidence
inadmissable is the interception without a warrant not the attempt to
interpret what was intercepted without a warrant  I'd be surprised
that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything
but analogous to a wiretap by the courts

Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically
feasible  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without
warrants just to fish for avenues to investigate  So in the future
start surveilance start archiving data trump up some probable cause
decrypt postfacto after the warrant is in hand and the investigation
gets a boost from data that sadly won't ever be presented to a jury

While I'm posting  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this
archiving scenario to extremes read Lacey and his Friends a
collection of sf stories by David Drake  The US starts down the
slippery slope by archiving everyghing  But don't worry folks it's
stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can
get to it  And by the way we'll be installing cameras on all major
streets  Hey this is nothing new we already have cameras in banks and
teller machines don't we

And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering all public
places  Then in some private places  Then we'll make it a crime ever
to be out of range of a camera except in legally licensed privacy
cubicles  Only alone  And with a thorough body search before and
after  But see there's still a right to privacy  We haven't
curtailed any rights not really  And just think how much easier it'd
be to solve crimes in such a situation just obtain a warrant put on a
VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane

And hey nobody'll be tracking you or me no need to be selfconscious

After all if you're not doing anything illegal

Funny though  While speeding and the radar detector industry became
pretty much a thing of the past somehow all this didn't elminate all
crime in the story  And somehow politicians got exemptions on grounds
of national security and rich corporations got exemptions for their
execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of
competition  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system  
I can't imagine why

Sigh my version of 'rn' asked me whether I really want to send this
posting

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the
Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake  I am the administrator
of csrcncslnistgov alias firstorg  It's a system set up to help out
the needs of FIRST a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams which 
includes a number of worldwide incident response teams such as CERTCC and
other places in Europe  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands they are normally
disabled since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of
incident response folks on our mailing lists  We had a disk crash several
months ago which required completely rebuilding the OS files  same old
story our backups weren't especially helpful  As you can guess I didn't
remember to redisable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to
find out who was behind clippercsrc  When I saw people's names posted
here I felt it was time to clear things up  So EXPN and VRFY on csrc have
always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with 
Clipper

I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here
because csrc also provides Usenet service  I posted them from an account
called 'clipper'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains
the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory
Board set up under law of the Computer Security Act of  and addresses
of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography
security and privacy  I believe that these individuals were included on
this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information
firsthand

The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above  It is 
not a source for information it was set up solely to monitor any initial
traffic  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get
traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet

While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this
I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives
of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias  I've already apologized to them
for what's happened  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common
practice albeit unfriendly to some and any effect of disabling it again
was unintentional

Reasonably fancy

    As promised I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington
 Times article about the Clipper chip announcement The name of the company
 is Secure Communications Technology Information will be given at the end
 of this message on how to contact them

     
 
    His belief is that ATT was made known of the clipper well before the
 rest of the industry This is for several reasons several of which are
 
	This is a very good point  ATT obviously knew and participated in the
development of the Clipper chip  This amounts to unfair business practice and
gives ATT an early monopoly on the market hopefully a nonexistant market
Other companies that compete with ATT in the cellular market Motorola NEC etc
have grounds to file a complaint over this

 
 Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out
 of business This is a very real possibility So they really need help in
 stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard If you want to contact
 them they can be reached at

It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this
whole fiasco is the economic standpoint  As others have mentioned the most
difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one  Let's face it the
average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea  If
there is a perceived need for cellular encryption then the companies will
provide one  Most likely a standard will emerge  But if the Clipper is
too expensive and  a chip is way too much then they will develope their
own or buy a cheaper one  I give SCT my full support and hope the
Clipper chip goes the way of the Beta video tape format

Also hope they get sued over reusing the name Clipper

       Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive
Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch it seems clear that one
of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the
Judicial Branch  I suggest the Supreme Court or regionally the
Courts of Appeal  More specifically the offices of their Clerks

       Courts already operate substantial recordkeeping operations  Some
of these records are confidential  So the concept of a court holding
information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal 
precedents  The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive
branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be  So judicial
control of keys is appropriate

       For the other half of the key I suggest a unit of Congress the
General Accounting Office  The GAO is Congress's staff unit for keeping
tabs on the Executive Branch and has an excellent reputation  It's
controlled strictly by Congress the Executive Branch has no authority
over it

       With keys split between the Legislative and Judicial branches
we might have a chance of this system working honestly  If of course
a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before
they reach the repositories

       This should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the
whole Clipper concept  But if we have to have it splitting control
across all three branches of government might make it work

Summary NSA use of HMM  References
Keywords Markov Modeling NSA
XNewsreader Tin  PL

In the article At last Now you can talk to your computer in the May
issue of FORTUNE magazine it was mentioned that phoneme prediction
used Hidden Markov Modeling  This was the statistical method that Markov
developed to predict letter sequences in Pushkin's novel Eugene Onegin
It was then said that this technique worked so well that the NSA used
it to crack codes
Does anyone have any references for HMM and how the NSA used it
Or is this just an extension of the letter frequency tables that we
are all using anyway

I think this is no accident  It comes from the same philosophy that
the government rulescontrols the people not the people controlling
the government that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough
to know what is best for them so the government must tell the people
what they need or do not need  we know best  And the idea that
that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping
or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook


Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart
chips' to encode anything they please internal passport under the
guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System and with
you can be certain more jewels yet to come and one sees an extremely
ominous trend  So what if  will be ten years late it still is
turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy unless a LOT of
people wake up and in a hurry

One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag
come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to
rights etc  from the unconnectedunprivileged citizen or should we
now be saying 'subject' instead  Why SHOULDN'T the average person
have a good secure system of data security not dependent on nebulous
'safeguards' for maintaining that security  Why SHOULDN'T the average
person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue  I am sure
the Feds could break into any data they really wanted to but it would
take some WORK and using the same logic one should not be allowed to
have a good safe unless a duplicate of the keys or combination are
submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government  I don't really see a
difference philosophically  Encrypted data sure won't evaporate not
with such hightech tools as a TAPE RECORDER


The average amerikan today seems to think that the government should be
able to eavesdrop on everyone else  Opinion polls show that most
people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people
when it is not identified as such BTW if anyone knows of a cite for that
I'd love to have it  Not only does this mean that these people are 
willing to give up everyone else's rights they don't even know what 
the Bill of Rights actually says

How can we show the average person not the average USENET reader that
people are actually entitiled to these rights  So many people don't
care if the government is taking more and more control of us all a little 
at a time  

If there was some sort of awareness of what the government is trying
to do by a majority of the US population Just think about what
could be accomplished  but there are so many that trust unthinkingly
in whatever the media and government tell them

         WASHINGTON UPI  The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
 start President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation

         In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural
 Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War would make
 everything so far seem so halfhearted that for all practical
 
 
 I just found out from my source that this article was a joke  Heh heh  
 It seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start  I just didn't
 notice the smiley at the end of the article and there were a few other
 hints which I should of caught

Well isn't this just a hoot   All I read on this group is a bunch
of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt
This just happens to be a case of an ordinaryjoenetter who decided
that he would create andor distribute some misinformation  Ppl buy
into BS posts like this I know because I forwarded a copy of the

admit itsorry Joe ready to get in a fight about FORFEITURE
Please if we're going to hold our govt which admittedly has had and
still has its problems to high standards then mustn't we follow these

coincidence or casts serious doubt on his bona fides posts a message in
which he seems willing to take the word of a private firm about which he
knows little that their new encryption algorithm is secure and contains no
trapdoors while seemingly distrusting that of the government about clipper

I suppose it depends on how paranoid one wishes to be but how does the
writer know the firm isn't for example an NSA front For purposes of this
message how do we know psionic isn't

I don't suggest that but post this to point out that there is a class of
speculation that has no more truth value without lots of hard evidence
than the contrary one

By the way if psionic had said in lower case letters that the firm

I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret
and some things that i think it implies Of course these could all be
wrong 

from 

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
                               Dorothy Denning
                           Revised April  





The Clipper Chip contains a classified singlekey bit block
encryption algorithm called Skipjack  The algorithm uses  bit keys
compared with  for the DES and has  rounds of scrambling
compared with  for the DES  It supports all  DES modes of
operation  The algorithm takes  clock ticks and in Electronic
Codebook ECB mode runs at  Mbits per second

Each chip includes the following components

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F an bit family key that is common to all chips
   N a bit serial number this length is subject to change
   U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip





ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the ATT
telephone security device as it will be  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key K
with the device at the other end  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip  In general any method of key exchange can
be used such as the DiffieHellman publickey distribution method

Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M digitized voice  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values

   EM K the encrypted message stream and 
   EEK U  N F a law enforcement field  

which are transmitted over the telephone line  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family
key F  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed



suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip but
did not know F then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from
if law enforcement field 
   EEK U  N F
not knowing N would might make this much harder

Now suppose that I know F either legitimately or not
If I know K either because I am involved in the conversation or I know U
for a party in the conversation I may now be able to determine U for the
other party

If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field since I could
make my own with a different K then the one I am using Knowing F also
allows traffic analysis to be performed So I might not know what you are
saying but I could know who you are saying it too

Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of
messages to work from but since we have no way of knowing that the key
generation method does not deliberately generate weak keys or for that
matter that the published method is in fact used perhaps the U's will be
chosen from know weak keys for the system

Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster both to law enforcement
for whom this whole thing is designed and for the people who believe that
it is giving them security F is but one number and I sure that alot of
people more then  know what it is and if some panel of experts is
going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F forget
grinding chips bribery and blackmail work just fine

So am I wrong Or are these problems

That wasn't my point My point is that your implied position about the Waco
Massacre is an assertion cum political position According to a CNN poll
about  of Americans think the FBI acted properly and a majority think
they should have done it the tear gas a lot sooner A large majority also
believe the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims
Koresh was Let's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A
hadn't X'd then B might not have Y'd

What you call the Big Brother Chip is right now a proposal under
discussion and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be
banned

Therefore neither justifies any tactic is fair Thus the statement is
nonsense It is pernicious because any tactic can lead to damaging
others

As I see you know from the tone of your reply there's nothing personal
intended

This has to be a dictionary attack  No other attack makes sense


This means that whoever encrypted the file just typed some password
which was a single dictionary word and then Russell tried all the
words in the dictionary  This isn't too implausible especially if he
was smart and clipped the first plaintext block off the ciphertext if
the first block doesn't decrypt then obviously the others won't
either

Assuming one attempt a second it takes seven hours to try all the
words in usrdictwords   Not real tough

If you want DES to be secure you have to use RANDOM KEYS  You can't
just type your wife's name and think aha they'll never guess that
one

 It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this
 whole fiasco is the economic standpoint  As others have mentioned the most
 difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one  Let's face it the
 average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea  If
 there is a perceived need for cellular encryption then the companies will
 provide one  Most likely a standard will emerge  But if the Clipper is
 too expensive and  a chip is way too much then they will develope their
 own or buy a cheaper one  

This is an interesting point  As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb you can
figure that the final price of a product is  to  times the Cost Of Goods
The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale Products that
sell tens of millions of unitsyear will be at the low end those that sell
thousands of unitsyear will be at the high end  I suspect cellular phones
are in the middle  This implies that adding a  chip would increase the
cost of the phone by approx  or about   

I don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this

using stolen cellular phones the FBI doesn't know which lines to tap
 unless of course they're tapping all phones maybe all cellular

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                           Revised April  

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx Inc which calls them the
MYK  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc


All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF Secure Compartmented
Information Facility which is essentially a vault  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips  About  chips
are programmed during a single session  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx

ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE  This article is based on
information provided by NSA NIST FBI and Mykotronx  Permission to
distribute this document is granted

So who is Mykotronx Inc  It would be nice to know that they were
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the 
US government  Trusting the fox to guard the chickens and all that
Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes

While we are at it the chip designs should be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm  It would be a 
shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip when
all I'd know is that someone rang and when I attempted to go off hook the
line went dead  Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect
directly to a modem

The design examination should be done to the gate level  Does anyone have
a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon  The model
would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function  Tip offs
would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence
is not right  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used
and its possible that might be noticed but could be edited from the netlist
I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated  Imagine a design
done in two layer metalization yet finding a third layer under the
microscope  

The government is asking for a lot of blind trust  the encryption algorithm 
operating protocols the agency having physical control of the devices the 
silicon implementation  I'd feel like keeping one hand on my wallet

              WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COSTEFFECTIVE

                        by Robin Hanson
                     Draft April  

  SUMMARY Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars
  wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police  So the
  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part 
  in three thousand to be costeffective 

BACKGROUND

Until now phones have happened to allow the existence of wiretaps
detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line  And over
time law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to
aid in criminal investigations  However powerful new encryption
technologies threaten this status quo by making possible truly
private communication  A small chip in each phone could soon make it
literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical
microphones at either end

In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap
phone conversations the US government announced on April  
that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special wiretap chip
to be placed in future phones instead of the total privacy chips
which have been under private development  The same day ATT
announced it would use these chips in all its secure telephone
products

Each chip would be created under government supervision when it would
be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key  Periodically during
each conversation the chip would broadcast its identifier and other
info in a special law enforcement block  Law enforcement officers
with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the
indentifier from special trust agencies and could thereby listen in
on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone

To date most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its
security  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm and
many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it
has claimed  The track record of previous governments does not
inspire confidence on this point 

However this paper will neglect these concerns and ask instead
whether this new wiretap chip is a costeffective tool for police
investigation  That is which is a cheaper way for society to
investigate crime force phone communications to support wiretaps or
give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways
Or to put it another way would police agencies be willing to pay for
each wiretap if they had to pay their share of the full social cost
of forcing phones to support wiretaps

To start to answer this question we might compare the current
benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected
costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan  And since current
benefits are easier to estimate we begin there

WIRETAP BENEFITS

 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available
  In that year  wiretap installations were requested and no
requests were denied  This figure does not include wiretaps obtained
with the consent of a party to the conversation   arrests
resulted from wiretaps started the same year  arrests came from
wiretaps in previous years and  of arrests led to convictions
 of the wiretaps were for phones vs pagers email etc  were
regarding drug offenses and  were requested by federal
authorities  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 
calls  of them incriminating among  people and cost an
average of  extrapolating from the  installations
reporting costs mostly for labor

Thus a total of about  Million was spent on wiretaps to obtain
about  arrests at  per arrest  Thus these arrests are at
least four times more expensive than the  per arrest figure one
gets by dividing the  Billion spent by all police nationally by the
total  Million nontraffic arrests   Thus the  Million per
year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police
expenditures  And if we divide this by the  Million phone access
lines in the country  we get about  cents spent per year per
phone line or about two cents a month

In general we deter a given class of criminals through a combination
of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted and some
expected punishment level if convicted  So the social value of having
wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get
the same criminal deterrence through other means  If unable to
wiretap a particular suspect's phone police might instead use hidden
microphones or investigate that suspect in other ways  Or police
might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps  Or
we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime

If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be
on average twice as expensive as wiretaps then the annual social
benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level
of two cents a month per phone line

WIRETAP COSTS

Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government
encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would
have offered instead protecting our conversations from the spying
ears of neighbors corporations and governments both foreign and
domestic  Even so the need to support wiretaps would add many
additional costs to build and maintain our communication system

Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions
increasing traffic by some unknown percentage  A special process must
be used to add encryption keys to chips while securely distributing
these keys to special agencies which must be funded and monitored
The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor whose
design is to remain secret and are manufactured through a special
process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart
Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of  a peice in
lots of    Private encryption systems not supporting
wiretaps would require none of these extra costs

Perhaps most important government degree would at least partially
replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to
be represented encrypted and exchanged in our future phones  It is
widely believed that governments are less efficient than private
enterprise in procuring products and standards though they may perhaps
perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private
standards  How much less efficient is a matter of debate some say
they pay twice as much while others might say only  more    

Currently a total of  Billion is spent as operating expenses of
US phone companies  which comes out to about  per month per
access line  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per
month we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even
as much as one part in  then wiretaps are not cost effective
And this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because
their encryption chips are more expensive  Of course most phones
wouldn't have encryption chips for a while but the wiretap benefit
per phone is still the same so this argument still applies

CONCLUSION

Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the
phone system and the value of wiretaps we can justify only the
slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps
When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to
attach clips to phone wires wiretap support may have been reasonable
But when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof is
clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs
would really be less than the benefits  

If consensus cannot be obtain on this costbenefit estimate a
compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a
rate of say five cents per month a tax payable to police agencies
nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities

How about half a friend  The Motorola Codex preliminary VFast modem
which you can by right now does  kbps raw over standard phone

Again voice can be compressed quite well down to  or  bps

I wouldn't think so  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
unsound to me

Maybe so but it's quite common There are millions of Macintosh users who
have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs Many have modems connected
How do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen Answer
 Because you trust Apple
 Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy Apple's credibility forever

In the Clipper case a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it and we'll have assurances maybe even from the President that
other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors While some may not
have confidence in that I am not among them it's a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life

   At the company I worked for previously I received a file that was
   des encryped and the person that had sent it went on vaction
   Rather than wait two weeks I set up a straight frontal attack with
   one key at a time  It only took two days to crack the file
   No I don't have any faith in DES
   

   Taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with
   much else that has been published here about brute force DES
   cracking unless Russell was lucky with respect to the key I'd be
   very interested in whether the program Russell used is available

key search is very practical in many real situations since people use
such stupid keys on the average  password crackers know this well

   Depending on his answer this could be an appalling development
   calling into question both DES and RSADES

not really  in fact public key based communication systems very
often pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords or
pass phrases

   If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack
   a single DES message in a couple of days assuming no tricks that
   are messagespecific

if a person picked the password or pass phrase then the key search is
pretty straightforward  in running english text the average content
of a single word is about  bits  in pass phrases this may increase
to  bits or so  searching bit spaces is semipractical even in
software and searching bit spaces isn't outrageous to imagine with
hardware assists of moderate size

Perhaps these encryptiononly types would defend the digitized porn if it
was posted encrypted

These issues are not as seperable as you maintain

In fact since effective encryption makes censorship impossible they
are almost the same issue and they certainly fall into the brief of the
EFF


It also falls within the purview of the ACLU but that doesn't mean
the ACLU or the EFF would be the most effective instrument to 
win the hearts and minds in favor of access to cryptography 

It's precisely slogans like cryptography makes censorship impossible
which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
of encryption  It is not true and in the context of a public debate it
would be a dangerous red herring  Advocates of strong crypto had better
prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
and politicians can sympathize with The usual mumblings about
Constitutional amendments are not enough

From these figures estimate the number of Clippertap requests the FBI
is expecting  Publish this figure  Compare it on a percapita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected

The Attorney General publishes the number of courtordered taps each year
It isn't enough around a thousand for the average noncrook nonspy to
worry about In fact considering any reasonable guess about the number of
bigtime crooks and spies around it may not be enough even for most crooks
and spies to worry about

There's no reason to believe that it will go up with Clipper since the
number of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption based
on the playbacks we've heard in court cases

This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative nonescrowed

clipper
	Because everyone but you expects that making alternative methods of

Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have the only way to
find out is to apply for a license

Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to Canada if
YOU have such a license and what is legal to send if you don't

Some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is
listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages
somehow if nonescrowed crypto goes away

A little perspective might be in order

The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low Law enforcement has to
present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
authorizations

Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
recorded by the government and for that to happen they have to
a Have a pretty good reason with evidence
b Use this sparingly on highest priority pretty good reasons

Though the system may be imperfect it is a long way from the horror stories
some here seem to believe or anticipate

  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the
FUD Fear Uncertainty Doubt factor
  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole
debate only vaguely  the government says it's solid other people in the
field say it's Swiss cheese  the balance of doubt could shift against the
Feds  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented
as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from
superior competition
  Comments

Since you asked the above is a bit inaccurate More accurate is that the
government says its solid other people in the field who might be able to
find out haven't yet done their review of the chip design and there's been
a lot of wild speculation and guesswork from those with little information
that it might be Swiss cheese

 Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this

That was probably me
I meant only that nobody has overreacted yet  It seemed to me that
Jerry was suggesting that people are currently overreacting and I 
vehemently disagree  I see a lot of talk but not much action
I see now that I misunderstood Jerry's position

 The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
 In a new Civil War 

 Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and I'm worried
 that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
 and paper  

Not this bunch  They'll just bitch on the Net for a while and 
then go back to lurking

 Can people work within the system before trying to break it  Examine your
 history books and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
 or Democratic style governments  I think you'll only find one in over
 five thousand years of written history

Actually it's not quite that bad but it's close

Look we collectively have the power to throw the bums out but we
don't use it  We clearly don't need to go burning things down but we
clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out
Unfortunately the bums have learned to target only small groups of
people at a single time so the masses won't react and throw them out
Eventually the masses will react unless the bums cease their
relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy
The sooner it happens the less the damages will be  I don't want to
live in a war zone either  I want to see the bums thrown out before
they do some real damage

If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against
using other cipher systems on these phones a new and potentially dangerous
class of crime is created

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specifically
the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats
will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and
to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
device will be delayed

You obviously haven't read the information about the system The chips
put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow
themselves to be identified The system does not rely on registering
people as owning particular phone units

I am against the proposal but lets be accurate in our objections

Absolutely  I just meant that no secure dedicated crypto device has

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down K  I think it is I've heard it's not  Lets
say  bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed s with
some room to spare  they turn kbit  bit samples k samplessec
into  baud However DSP is hairy and I have yet to see actual
proof of this in the form of an implementation I have heard fairly
reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a
CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 's with some room to
spare but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy
 the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code
without having beaten on it for a very very long time first 

DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this
problem

                           Revised April  

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx Inc which calls them the
MYK  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF Secure Compartmented
Information Facility which is essentially a vault  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips  About  chips
are programmed during a single session  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx

ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE  This article is based on
information provided by NSA NIST FBI and Mykotronx  Permission to
distribute this document is granted

So who is Mykotronx Inc  It would be nice to know that they are
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the 
US government

While we are at it the chip designs should be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm  There is
no proof that the chip won't squeel and role over for someone with the
proper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link

The design examination should be done to the gate level  Also how does one
verify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout or masks

The silicon should be examined as well the design in hand a clean room
publicly defined clipper chip can be merged with another design later or
changed between completion and mask out  There is little proof that what
you are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip

Put the verified masks in escrow and use them for chip production
use a third escrow party for programming the chips 

The government is asking for a lot of blind trust  the encryption algorithm 
operating protocols the agency having physical control of the devices the 
silicon implementation  If the  government is so trustworthy why escrow
anything

 We do need an alternative to NSAbugged telephones but 
 we're talking inexpensive telephones here including handsized

So start a company and build them  This is still mostly a capitalist 
economy

Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for their new CDMA digital
cellular phones They wanted to put strong crypto into them since they
had the capacity The government decided to discourage them

Really none of this stuff is especially hard All you need for a true
private phone is an ISDN codec a vocoder either a chip or
software an encryptor a chip is fine but software is more than
fast enough a V or Vbis modem module and maybe a
microcontroller to run the whole thing Its easy to do its cheap And
any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from Washington just like Qualcomm
did I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their
products are too expensive

However no law yet stops one from building really private phones in
spite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new
crime bill and in connection with the ClipperSkipjack Big Brother
chip Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this Better yet
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any  box with a
sound card into a secure phone

 At the company I worked for previously I received a file that was des encryped
 and the person that had sent it went on vaction  Rather than wait two weeks
 I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time  It only took two
 days to crack the file  No I don't have any faith in DES
 
 
 Taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with much else
 that has been published here about brute force DES cracking unless Russell
 was lucky with respect to the key I'd be very interested in whether the
 program Russell used is available In whether he used a cleartext
 recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
 decryption by hand In whether he used a known plaintext attack

Given that certain archival methods have certain keycleartext in a file I
used a programatic dictionary attack  I used the DES library provided with the
system that I was using  What is to keep anyone from being lucky with a key
 
 He probably should also tell us given his address what machine he useda
 desktop workstation or supercomputer

My previous employment has nothing to do with my current address other than
the fact that the fastest machine in the office was an IBM RISC System 
model  with  meg of memorynot a supercomputer
 
 Depending on his answer this could be an appalling development calling into
 question both DES and RSADES Dunno about RSAIDEA

I really think this more of a statement of the limitations placed on the key
by the interfaceascii charno padding and most programs don't bother to
clear off the archival front and backend ID's

 If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single
 DES message in a couple of days assuming no tricks that are
 messagespecific then here's my Clipper key NSA give me the chip at
 once  

Yes any moderatly bright programmer with a little idle machine time can
crack most of todays real world encryption  I sure that you or I could
select a key and prepare the data inorder that the decryption will become a 
worst case  but that is not the real world and I'm sure that is how any 
agency would start an attack on a message as you pointed out there are some 
very good recognition algorithms availible I'm just not familiar with them

   In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
   disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts I've tossing back and
   forth  

Me too A tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in
the sand

   The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
   In a new Civil War 

How many people do you want jailed for their convictions for their
insistence on real privacy Why sit by quietly while the preconditions
for a real civil war are put in place by a shortsighted government

   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and I'm worried
   that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
   and paper  

The terminal is mightier than the pen 

   Can people work within the system before trying to break it  Examine your
   history books and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
   or Democratic style governments  I think you'll only find one in over
   five thousand years of written history

Really I guess you mean the US revolution How about England
India Mexico France Holland

   That's not very good odds  

You are misinformed But this whole issue is off the topic

   Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be
   used in response to an armed attack  It is not meant to be used in
   agression  This is the difference between selfdefence and murder

When the cops kick in your door for using PGP tell them that All
we're doing here is exercising our socalled rapidly narrowing
right to free speech 

   I'm probably overreacting  But what I've read scared me a lot  I don't
   want my children growing up in a War Zone

Perhaps you should talk to the government about that Or are you a
disciple of David The cops are our FRIENDS Sternlight

The implied threat of the illegalization of private crypto the
notsosubtle subtext of the clipper announcement is what worries me
I don't want my children growing up in a police state

  It is my intent to cut the government off at the knees with the pen

I agree that it is best to use those resources to the maximum extent
before seriously contemplating anything more disruptive

  Maybe so but it's quite common There are millions of Macintosh users who
 have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs Many have modems connected
 How do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen Answer
  Because you trust Apple
  Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy Apple's credibility forever  

  The reason I could theoretically trust Apple though I'm a PC person
myself   is that Apple has to worry about their customers deserting
them if they screw up badly enough  The government doesn't have any such
worry it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants  This
is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient
than government agencies

Really none of this stuff is especially hard All you need for a true
private phone is an ISDN codec a vocoder either a chip or
software an encryptor a chip is fine but software is more than
fast enough a V or Vbis modem module and maybe a
microcontroller to run the whole thing Its easy to do its cheap And
any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from Washington just like Qualcomm
did

	Have the feds shut down the people making Sound Blaster What
about Apple and NeXT Apple NeXT Sun and others make systems that
can handle CDquality audio in and out and can perform arbitrary
transformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network
or modem

	Perhaps there's a market for a portable vocoder Not a crypto
device simply an RSvoice converter Make it capable of recording
speech and playing it back simultaneously It has applications for
multimedia computing for the handicapped Internet Talk Radio IRC
etc etc etc  It wouldn't be a cryptographic device at all  but I
suppose someone could have it hooked to a  laptop with a Vbis
modem and some crypto software I'd market the thing with an API for
texttospeech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech
samples And of course I'd publish the interface to it so other
folks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing

I just joined this group recently and really do not know much about
cryptography but a couple things came to mind while reading through
the posts

  Is the Clipper chip going to be exported  If not how will
people communicate with other countries  Will they have to do
that in uncryptmode  Will other encryption techniques be
legal assuming the government cracks down on using others when
going overseas but not within the states

  I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic  
security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted
PIN based on the timedate  The host system has the algorithm
built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user
Is there some form of encryption technology that would create
keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time  The 
systems would then allow a window of time around this instant
where the key would work
I realize that this technique would increase the amount of information
needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather
than just keys  But for smaller scale things it might work
Could some similar method be used to make the two bit keys that
are issued to policeFBIetc to tap a phone only usable for oneweek
for instance  If further surveilance was needed they would have
to go back to the escrow service to get another key  This would
make it useless for local police to database keys they have used

I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need
to be able to decypher the message  But any thoughts on the subject

Thanks

 In article fpiZBGWCqOKYwandrewcmuedu you write
 suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip but
 did not know F then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from
 if law enforcement field 
    EEK U  N F
 not knowing N would might make this much harder
 
 They're betting that you can't do this even if you know N  Even if you
 know E in fact which they're trying to keep secret  If you can find E
 by grinding down the chip presumably you can find F as well  But we can't
 do this right now with DES even knowing the encryption method without
 doing almost the whole bit search

That is not true with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined
without the full search

 
 Now suppose that I know F either legitimately or not
 If I know K either because I am involved in the conversation or I know U
 for a party in the conversation I may now be able to determine U for the
 other party
 
 Again they're betting that you can't find U given K  ie they claim the
 encryption is strong  Trust us

I am not willing to take that bet

 If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field since I could
 make my own with a different K then the one I am using Knowing F also
 allows traffic analysis to be performed So I might not know what you are
 saying but I could know who you are saying it too
 
 I'm not sure there'll be a way to shove arbitrary key and data through your
 chip but if so this part's OK  We're assuming E is unknown

You can obviously shove arbitrary data through your chip
As for the key it is stated that the sesion key exchange is external to
the chip so I can pick my keys too

 Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of
 messages to work from but since we have no way of knowing that the key
 generation method does not deliberately generate weak keys or for that
 matter that the published method is in fact used perhaps the U's will be
 chosen from know weak keys for the system
 
 They assume that you won't be able to find U no matter how many messages
 you have  If they could break U they wouldn't need the key escrow

BING BING BING BING BING THAT EXACTLY MY POINT SINCE WE CANT KNOW THAT
THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS CAPABILITY THE ONLY SAFE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY
DO i admit that most of my cryptographic complaints are probably
unfounded but since we cant know one way or the other im not gonig to
take their word for it

 Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster both to law enforcement
 for whom this whole thing is designed and for the people who believe that
 it is giving them security F is but one number and I sure that alot of
 people more then  know what it is and if some panel of experts is
 going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F forget
 grinding chips bribery and blackmail work just fine
 
 It's not clear that the experts will be told F  In fact I'd be surprised
 I'd expect something more of the form of the FIPS pub describing DES so that
 they could look at the algorithm in general rather than with the specific
 set of keys chosen

Oh come on thats like saying you could evaluate DES without the Sbox
constants

psionicwamumdedu whose parenthesized name is either an unfortunate
coincidence or casts serious doubt on his bona fides posts a message in
which he seems willing to take the word of a private firm about which he
knows little that their new encryption algorithm is secure and contains no
trapdoors while seemingly distrusting that of the government about clipper

I have a couple reasons why I would be more likely to trust this algorithm
	 The algorithm will be made totally public once it is patented
	 The keys will NOT be escrowed
Of course if either of these is not true I will not use this new algorithm
Since I have never seen this new algorithm I have no idea how secure it is
yet

I suppose it depends on how paranoid one wishes to be but how does the
writer know the firm isn't for example an NSA front For purposes of this
message how do we know psionic isn't

I don't suggest that but post this to point out that there is a class of
speculation that has no more truth value without lots of hard evidence
than the contrary one

By the way if psionic had said in lower case letters that the firm
CLAIMS there was no back door I'd have no problem with that phrasing

I can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet but I do notice
that the creators of this algorithm are being more open about how the
thing works and is willing to make it public showing that after a bit
of scrutiny any weaknesses will probably be revealed while we don't know
about Clipper

   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
   the cryptosystem design

   I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow
   the algorithm through to hardware  While I doubt the NSA would pull
   any monkey business on this point  they have to expect that the
   chip will be reverseengineered sooner or later  it's an obvious
   opportunity to introduce additional holes

The chip isn't the place to pull the monkey business  you do it in
the key generation either by having a mathematical backdoor
or by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the
keys also save a copy of S and S and leak it out somehow
or by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys
on the chip actually put a different key there VERY hard to detect
since the escrow agents have to either trust the NSA laptop or
give each other the S keys and they still don't know the algorithm
Or have the chipburner at the factory make copies of the keys
Or whatever

There are chips which perform the voice compressionexpansion  They can't
be expensive because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the
PBX line cards as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses
voicegrade circuits to save the cost of longdistance leased Ts or
satellite circuits

I can't remember the generic term for these chips  My impression is that
this was a big deal  years ago but circuits have gotten so cheap that
it isn't done much now

Some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is

somehow if nonescrowed crypto goes away
A little perspective might be in order

Right  People here believe the government is listening in on
everything  Sure  If you can't provide an answer change the
assumptions to something you can deal with

It's not a matter of the government listening on on everything it's a
matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in
Say if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a
mall the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search and
acquires your name  It's a matter of any number of possible wiretap
abuses that cryptology makes far less likely and this chip can
sabotage 

Par for the course though  I predicted that you'd be jumping in in
favor of this  The reply was that you'd justify anything up to and
including death camps as long as the government backed them and had a
written policy statement  Perhaps a little extreme but not much

   How fast do the fastest modems go

VFAST is targeted for about kbps kbps is  and  may
be here soon too  Remember to ignore compression figures which make
your modem go faster on compressible data because voice gets
compressed better than that and encryption makes further compression impossible

   How far can voice be compressed

The STUIII phones on the market from ATT Motorola and I forget who else
give you a choice of   and  baud  The  and  are CELP
and I think the  is some earlier military vocoder stuff
 is decent  is pretty artificial anything less is SpeakSpell

Oldhand government crypto have trouble adjusting to systems faster
than  baud because if the voice on the other end sounds good
you assume the crypto hasn't been turned on yet

Tom Clancy omitted these key steps to try to prevent groups of people from
building a nuclear bomb  However he asserts that you can find these key
steps in any university library  The main point of Five Minutes To Midnight
is that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons
since it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one and fissible
materials are nearly impossible to control  Read this article or better

  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread Any back
doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme and help grow
the market demand for a secure alternative


There are companies one in Canada as I recall which specialize in
analyzing chips to understand process technology design rules
 to understand the probable yield of the assembly line making them
and therefore the probable current cost and possible future cost curves
given design shrinks statistical quality control  better yields etc

Taiwanese Japanese and especially Korean semiconductor manufacturers
have all korea continues reverseengineered foreign chips and
produced the chip  Taiwan and Japan have signed intellectual
property treaties and now at least extract the gatetransitor level
design before laying the chip out again  The koreans still
use masklevel copying I believe  At least they are under a lot
of pressure to pass laws to meet international intellectual property
standards

All this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs  There are lots
of techniques to do so in both hardware and software design

For a complex chip there will be real intellectual effort extracting
the gate design from the transistor design and the algorithm from
the gate design  But it won't take two smart guys even  months working
 hour weeks  Koreans work  or more

 They're betting that you can't cryptanalyze E to get U given N
   But we can't
 do this right now with DES even knowing the encryption method without
 doing almost the whole bit search

That is not true with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined
without the full search

By almost I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack  The chosen
plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about  chosen plaintexts
drawn from a total of about  that need to be run if I understand the
situation correctly  This is certainly a break under the meaning of the
Act but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch

The rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack
encryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and
observe the results  I wish him joy of it and choose not to try that attack

I am not defending the system and in fact am offended by the ideas of
escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard
However I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons since that
weakens the case against it

I said in my private email
 It's not clear that the experts will be told F  In fact I'd be surprised

No it's quite different  The government would have no percentage in
choosing F to be a weak key since it's not to their advantage to have
anybody else know it  The experts could thus assume that F is no worse
than anything else during their analysis  Totally different situation
from unknown Sboxes  Again I'm not saying it would be good or
satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without
the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and
so on  simply that I doubt that they would be given all the
information

they fail at that

trouble is telephones were invented a long time ago and people didn't

Remember in the
announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two
extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a
Constitutional right to encryption  

So much for Clinton's support of the right of privacy

There's an out for him  The announcement talked about strong cryptography
I believe  Specifically

	nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product

Every vendor claims his product is unbreakable  so this was sloppy wording

I am not claiming that we private citizens should have access to the NSA's
best secret algorithms  I don't want any NSA algorithms actually

I'll let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms  and RSA's

All I want is what I have already  the ability and right to invent and use
my own algorithms share them with my friends and sell them

     Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece New Encryption
to scicrypt there has been some discussion of our company
Secured Communications Technologies Inc and on encryption
algorithm NEA
     I spoke to Craig at length on  and we covered a lot
of ground  Some of the information in the posting requires some
clarification and I would like to answer some of the questions
raised on scicrypt
     SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland  Our
two main products at this time are a PC based secure
communications program called SECOM and a general purpose
encryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM
     SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link
between two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines  It
supports simultaneous bidirectional file transfer and keyboard
to screen chat  It has its own proprietary communications
protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption  All
though it is a packetized link the data stream appears to be
continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden
     When SECOM was initially developed it was implemented to
use DES encryption  A business decision was made to seek export
approval for the product because it was perceived that the
overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing
opportunity
     We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general
export approval for anything using DES  All though the reason
for this was never explicitly stated it seems to have something
to do with secret government to government agreements which are
still in effect
     In any event the decision was made to develop a new and
different algorithm which would take the place of DES  This was
the reason NEA New Encryption Algorithm was born
     At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret  The
preliminary work of patenting it has begun and the plan is to
make it public once the patent process is complete  All though
one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing
secret I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is
necessary to let people shoot at it over an extended period of
time to prove its worth
     In order to get export approval for SECOMNEA it was
necessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of
the program and algorithm  This was done only AFTER we had a
finished product to submit
     Let me state unequivocally that there is NO back door to
the program or the algorithm  Secured Communications
Technologies is a closely held private company and
NSAFBICIANISTWHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way
whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved
     From a practical business standpoint we are interested in
selling chips and software hopefully in large quantities and a
back door to the encryption if found out could destroy our
credibility and our business
     With the encryption algorithm approved for export we set
out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption
products and systems  We were able to identify several common
threads of functionality requirements  This led to the design of
a chip with the encryption algorithm cast in silicon and
certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill
the broad range of requirements that we identified
     We are strongly opposed to the clippercapstone chips  In a
press release today our president Dr Stephen Bryen stated

          It seems as if the government has an unlimited source
     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American
     Public  But do we not understand how the National Security
     Agency which is not supposed to be involved in domestic
     spying can fund the development of a commercial chip
     intended to accommodate US government domestic spying
     activities

     If they had asked me to put a back door in NEA I would
have told them to g fed
     Can NSA break NEA  Or for that matter can they break DES

know and probably never will

I just signed up for this group so I hope I'm not missing something
in a FAQ but I'm looking for a good introduction to the mathematics
of encryption  particularly DES and PublicKey though others would
be interesting also  Probably a good library could help me out but I
thought it might be even easier if I could obtain a nice article
entirely electronically besides I have this rather rational phobia
of libraries for reasons stemming from this dissertation thing
hanging over my head   
	I have a basic knowledge of mathematics numbertheory is a
bit unfamiliar to me but I've had a few graduatelevel math courses
in some other areas anyway I'm not a complete novice to the field
So probably something aimed at a basic graduate introductory level
would be about right  Something anyway which is more specific than
a really big prime number is generated to code the message
	If someone knows of a good text available by ftp or gopher
or would like to email me one please let me know  I'll probably keep
reading this group but it would be nice if you would email me at the
same time so I don't miss it

Thanx Lulu

If you can get it for a buck nd hand it must be true eh I'm pretty

	 Monitor usenet
	 Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack
	 etc etc

	This is not to say that they don't they might But you don't
know that they do and you have no evidence that they do for almost
all values of you It follows therefore that for most values of 'you'
your claims about the NSA border on paranoia

	Andrew


OK Andrew I'll provide some evidence A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a westcoast office They routinely sold
equipment to the Japanese One day the Japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products

This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
offices The Japanese had simply intercepted it So my friend the computer
systems admin came up with a solution He started sending the data out
doubleblockencrypted with DES 

Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents They told him to
knock it off The president gave in since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government

Now if the government wasn't monitoring the communications how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed Further since encryp
tion isn't illegal and DES certainly isn't what is the basis of the
government's ceaseanddesist demand

The spooks do whatever they think is necessary with or without the blessings
of the law I'll say no thanks to Clipper or anything else the government
produces For the moment double or triple DES is probably adequate And when
the line is idle send random garbage just to keep 'em busy

In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts I've tossing back and
forth  

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this

The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
In a new Civil War 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and I'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it

A circut court judge in Illinois once said When dealing with a government
that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry
one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means
to parry this attack on personal privacy

Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar
detectors

The point remains  More and more I see the government slowly washing
away privacy  Even unwittingly  Do you think I will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth  Do you think I
will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what I'm saying  Even if there is no evidence of my
guilt  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind  I'm tired
of it  There is IMHO no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy

More than the proposals themselves I read the language of the press
releases the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public and I am sickened  I am revolted  I am repulsed

 perhaps even  of this country could care less about the
clipper chip the wiretap bill the smart card because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration

This saddens and frightens me

I am a conserveative believe it or not  A law and order conserveative
But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me
mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the American people  Tell them it's going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists and they will let you
put cameras in their home

Even in the wake of Waco you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves

Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack  It is not meant to be used in
agression  This is the difference between selfdefence and murder

To be quite honest the way things are going I'd call it self defense

Let's try to avoid killing things eh  There's enough blood shed in the
world without adding a couple of riots Civil Wars etc

I'm probably overreacting  But what I've read scared me a lot  I don't
want my children growing up in a War Zone


And I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera
 hours a day

               WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COSTEFFECTIVE

   SUMMARY Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars
   wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police  So the
   proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part 
   in three thousand to be costeffective 

Robin's calculation is interesting and important even if it's off by
an order of magnitude for example

Even if hardware costs for the Clipper Chip phones were ZERO the
protocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much
higher than the  part in  thousandit depends on the exact details
of the phone call length protocol etc shorter calls get a
proportionately greater hit

However I suspect most Americans will not find this line of reasoning
as persuasive as the analogies about escrowing keys to one's house
are

The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip how it is used
how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the
escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications

Interesting  Tell us what happens if I were to say OK I want to have
something else  If the law enforcement wants my traffic they can record
it then get a search warrant and get the keys FROM ME just like they
would the keys to a stout private safe etc Lets say I suspect that
there is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level with no warrant
say for NSA scanning for keywords etc and the government has abused
great power in the past

So I say Mr Vendor I want something different independent  I am
a paranoid sort ya understand

Will the result be Sorry without Government permission we cannot sell
you anything secure or would it be Sorry we know which side our
bread is buttered on we cannot sell except to government people law
enforcement and 'special' people

What in your opinion would be the chances of sure we will sell you
this secure system  be happy to

Also please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private
encryption of say files transferred by modem or FTP or data stored
on disk  SURELY you have a feel for what the administration is planning
for us people on that  With your rather intimate relationship with
the FBI NSA etc you must CERTAINLY have an idea  You are surely
not going to say the people are not to know until it is too late
This IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE isn't
it  That is the people ARE the government's BOSSES  The BOSSES
want to know what the  is going on here

You see I am kind of nervous because in the last month or so I have
seen a nonstop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least
appear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy freedom
from Govt eavesdropping and the ability to defend ourselves against
violent attack no  is NOT good enough for 'common folk' they
arrive only in time to clean up the mess I would be DEAD if I had to
depend on    You see with all that talk about National smart
ID cards limiting of encryption to 'government approved' denial of
means to effective personal defense EIGHT bills in congress right now
it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace
EVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave  All it would take
is requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions
and with no effective data protection and with the people suitably
disarmed there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it now
would there  All in the name of the War on the Constitu  er 
drugs and of course that catch word 'terrorists'  What is wrong with
good OLDFASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case  They don't want to
have to be burdened to leave the office it seems

Please read the Bill of Rights first ten amendments to the US
Constitution and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brotherish
policy of the Administration always for a 'crisis' of some kind isn't
it with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote
it

Reassure us  please or is that no longer regarded as necessary
seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda the
Administration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret then
springing it on us  Doesn't sound much like  by the PEOPLE
to me  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were
NOT mentioned on the press release  I find that more than a little
bit curious don't you  I sure would like to know who to not vote
for come election time

Yes I am upset  I feel you are a part of this because I recall it
was you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea could
have been the SAME thing it was so close a few months ago  I
also recall it was not well received  Apparantly powersthatbe
really didn't care or were not told or both

From what I see Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't
want the neighborhood kid listening in on  Any SERIOUS security I don't
think I would want to trust it a bit  Might as well use cleartext
Certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious
tradesecret data especially if millions depended on that security
Given enough money one could BUY any keys they wanted  Buy a crooked
judge and a crooked cop   Given a few hundred thou they wouldn't be
hard to find  So we end up with only criminals terrorists and the
Government with real security and the ability to eavesdrop  You know
the first two if they are serious ain't going to use this thing for
THEIR communications  I bet the government won't either except perhaps
to order a pizza

Tell us will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity
someone not using the 'government approved' methods  That just a desire
to have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an
unconnected citizen  Will that be grounds for a flythroughthedoor
raid and confiscation of all one's equipment as 'terrorist tools'
using civil forfeiture so there will be no inconvenient need to
PROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen

I have yet another question are we going to see articles in all the
public magazines consisting of soothing text telling us how great
this is how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion
of privacy  That the government is going to be so kind as to let
us 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT  What you want to bet that I am
correct here

Please answer these questions  As citizens of the United States we
hava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have
out of the goodness of their hearts

Funny thing though  with all these proposals I don't feel ONE BIT
safer from drug dealers terrorists or a common street thug  I am
beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities
or our own government gone out of control

Reassure us please  So far I haven't seen much to reassure me
and a LOT to greatly disturb me

  More accurate is that the government says its solid other people
 in the field who might be able to find out haven't yet done their
 review of the chip design and there's been a lot of wild speculation
 and guesswork from those with little information that it might be
 Swiss cheese

  Oh that puts the debate on excellent terms for our side

  FEDS  You people saying that Clipper is insecure don't have any real
information to support that judgment
  ME  Fine  show me this information that would prove me wrong
  FEDS  That's secret

  When it comes down to that it looks suspiciously like some government
official pasting TOP SECRET stamps over embarrasing information in order
to save his own hide  In fact framing the secrecy issue in that perspective
is more likely to turn Joe Sixpack's suspicions against the Feds than the
Constitutional argument  a point I urge the others on the profreedom
side to consider when making their case

           R  EDENSSS
 
   Why is the tripleencrytion used  Is it just to gain an effective
increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch  If so why use
 bit keys  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm it's
not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
guess SS
 
   Why are N N and N formed as they are  It would be facinating to
see the Skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require
three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way
 
   Where do the bit constant values that are concatenated with the
serial number to form NNN come from  Are they changed from chip to
chip or session to session  Even if they're published in the NY Times
if SkipJack is resistant to knownplaintext attacks when using triple
encryption then there's no break in security  But why allow that kind
of weird format  If those three bit values are trulyrandom bits then
maybe it's used to ensure that a knownplaintext attack on SkipJack if
it exists can't be easily used to derive S and S for a whole production
run of these chips
 
   Does Dorothy Denning read this group  If not is someone on the group
forwarding questions like these to her or Martin Hellman or anyone else
who's seen more details about the chip

  The points raised about checking what is actually in the chip as
opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust
issue  Even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering
a wide range of S and S seeds rather than using the same one all the
time to reduce the key search space to  bits I assume they are not
doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
at carefully selected points to encode data  They would presumably be
punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program
the chips in a manner completely independent of the S and S values they
are feeding into the system

Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for their new CDMA digital

You're blowing smoke  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice lucrative overseas

if you ever hope to export this technology  The reason that CDMA doesn't
have encryption is NOT because the Gmen came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door
It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular
is big enough for them  This is just the International Traffic in Arms

If you don't believe me call Qualcomm and ASK THEM  Don't just throw
out conspicracy theories  At least don't do it on scicryptthere are
whole other newsgroups devoted to this kind of uninformed claptrap

any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from Washington just like Qualcomm
did I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their
products are too expensive

Hah  They're not that much more expensive  Besides if a drug dealer
can afford a Rolex and a Mercedes he can darn well afford Cylink phones
No Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different
stuff for domestic use vs export  Qualcomm isn't  So Cylink makes
moneythat's capitalism comrade

Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this Better yet
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any  box with a

anyting ever done with these  Are Khufu Khafre andor Snefru still
being discussed anywhere  I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA
FAQ and I think it may also be in the scicrypt FAQ
   On a related topic can anyone point me toward good sites to find

   I've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make PGP available
in some form on EBCDIC machines  The message authentication would be ugly
but I think at least the IDEA encryption could work if PGP had a switch
to tell it to use IDEA in OFBmode or ECBmode  In OFBmode errors in
translating EBCDICASCIIEBCDIC would only affect their byte not the
 bytes that would be affected under CBC
   Is PGP set up to use different IDEA modes  I don't recall notincing it
in the executable but I haven't gone through it as carefully as I probably
should

I have been scanning and trying to read the articles in the scicrypt area
but what do I get   SURPRISINGLY the blurb comes upon the screen  file xxx
has either been cancelled or expired       Now I ask you If it expired
wouldn't it be out of the available file cache
I am  and not a paranoid but the older I get the greater my cynicism of
both federal and state governments becomes    
The censorship  of this Internet and it is no less than censorship stupid me it's the GOVT
is ridiculous  The Japanese have far outstripped our ciphertechnology  and 
our government is now before your very observant eyes trying to force the
crypto standard onto a framefork where the standard is now an ancient
relic in terms of modern Japanese security techniques


Now I pose the question Why censor folks on the net and send the warning
shown above cancelled or expired when it would be wiser to not let people
see the post at all

Please don't be insulted but based on this I would say that your
encryption algorithm is very likely not worth the paper it's printed
on  If the NSA gave export approval that means they felt confident
that they could crack it  that's their JOB mandated by LAW and
I'm sure they believe in what they do  If they gave export approval
to an encryption algorithm which they weren't confident of being able
to crack they would be derelict in their sworn duty to monitor foreign
communications for US national security related material

Just because many most of us think that the government and the spooks
are pugnacious slimeballs is no reason to lose sight of the fact that
they do their jobs to the best of their ability and further that said
ability is rather high  I hope that one day we can make them all
obsolete but until then we have to cope with their existence
Export approvals are one thing they do that we can learn a lot from

 Taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with much else
 that has been published here about brute force DES cracking unless Russell
 was lucky with respect to the key I'd be very interested in whether the
 program Russell used is available In whether he used a cleartext
 recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
 decryption by hand In whether he used a known plaintext attack
 
 He probably should also tell us given his address what machine he useda
 desktop workstation or supercomputer
 
 Depending on his answer this could be an appalling development calling into
 question both DES and RSADES Dunno about RSAIDEA
 
 If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single

company claimed to me during a priavte conversation that given the
equipment in his lab he could crack a Kerberos ticket in  minutes to
an hour He had access to rather powerful DES hardware but not of an

amount of known plaintext in the ticket which itself constitutes a small

DES is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data For a
lot of purposes however it is still very adequate

agent in the UK sold a system to a company in CH which packaged it in a
product for CZ LondonBernPrague  I telexed the Brits and told them
the Swiss need to pass export paperwork through the US as at the time
you needed an export lisence for these systems

Now I knew the NSA was watching this traffic just like they are watching
THIS traffic

And what do you know two weeks later an agent of the US government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the Evil
Empire we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly

He was part of a FIVE man office in COLUMBUS OHIO who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal I assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there isn't
that much stuff coming out of Columbus 

Wow the electric utility in Prague sure is a big worry for these folks 

The point is we have created a giant bureaucracy NSA with a budget
bigger than the CIA's who like all bureaucracies fill their time looking
for things to do  The Evil Empire is gone  The NSA is not  They will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets  I just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass but that is too
much to hope for they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and

I believe it's legal to send DES code or equipment from the US to Canada
with no export license  I think this is the only place you can do this  all
other countries require a license

As an aside I've always thought it should be legal to send DES software
anywhere if you follow these rules

     Encrypt your DES software with DES
     Send the encrypted software to the recipient
     Send the key to the recipient

The only way the person on the other end can use your DES software is if
heshe already has DES available  otherwise they can't decrypt your
program and it is useless  If you've guaranteed they already have DES
have you really violated any law by sending it to them in the form of

Good idea But why put all the eggs in one basket

Given that the escrow keys are generated  at a time on floppy disks why
not keep them there rather than creating one huge database that will have to

Give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping The USA has over

If they're planning on patenting an algorithm then I hope they go out of

 The chips are programmed by Mykotronx Inc which calls them the
 MYK  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc  They are
 implemented in  micron technology and will initially sell for about
  each in quantities of  or more  The price should drop as the
 technology is shrunk to  micron

Hmmmmmm   seems a bit expensive  How big is the chip  What kind
of packages will be used   volt or  volt technology  How much
current will it draw  I think there are many practical questions
that haven't been answered especially since this chip already exists

 All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF Secure Compartmented
 Information Facility which is essentially a vault  The SCIF contains
 a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips  About  chips
 are programmed during a single session  The SCIF is located at
 Mykotronx
 
 At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key
 escrow agencies enters the vault  Agent  enters a secret random
 bit value S into the laptop and agent  enters a secret random
 bit value S These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
 keys for a sequence of serial numbers  Thus the unit keys are a
 function of  secret random bits where each agent knows only 

OK I've got a big problem with all of this  How in the world do you
expect to sell these chips for even  after all the overhead involved
in this programming procedure   people a laptop only  chips at 
a time  give me a break  And how long does all of this take  Even if
it is a minute per chip it will take the greater part of a day to 
turn out  of these things  How long do you suppose it will take to
program those  chips mentioned above  This is highly impractical

 To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the ATT
 telephone security device as it will be  Suppose I call someone and
 we both have such a device  After pushing a button to start a secure
 conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key K
 with the device at the other end  

So where can I find info on this ATT device  What kind of vocoder
does it use  Does it require ISDN phone lines  If not is it full
duplex  How does it sound  What kind of synchronization scheme is
used  Will all other little black boxes have to conform to ATTs choices
of protocol etc  Will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that
conform to these specifications

OK Andrew I'll provide some evidence A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a westcoast office They routinely sold
equipment to the Japanese One day the Japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products

This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
offices The Japanese had simply intercepted it So my friend the computer
systems admin came up with a solution He started sending the data out
doubleblockencrypted with DES 

Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents They told him to
knock it off The president gave in since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government

Now if the government wasn't monitoring the communications how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed Further since encryp
tion isn't illegal and DES certainly isn't what is the basis of the
government's ceaseanddesist demand

Something similar has happened to me  ages ago when we were working on PGP
we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test 
new features around  Now at this time PGP and certainly the newer version
was unknown over here  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received
a request that I stop sending encrypted email  Now there is almost no way
that some automatic scanner could have found this since they wouldn't have
known about PGP  they must have checked for unknown data types in the
message tried to unscramble it found they couldn't get past the PEM
armour part and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop  Luckily
the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their
networks 

In case people think email scanning doesn't take place I can assure you
that it is done regularly by many sites  usually not by government
agencies or at least not that I know of but by local administrators who
for reasons of their own have decided to monitor all communications
I'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons  stop hackers
terroristschild pornographersdrug dealersevil commieswhatever  There
have been several occasions when I've got people into trouble simply by
including the traditional NSA bait in a message I don't try it any more
now   A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of
the UK town of Scunthorpe hint look for words embedded in it  I'm sure
there are many more examples of this happening in fact if anyone has any
examples I'd appreciate hearing from them  I could use them as
ammunition during talks on privacy issues

   In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
   disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts I've tossing back and
   forth  

Me too A tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in
the sand

I never advocated hiding in the sand  I'm advocating a peaceful
solution while a peaceful solution is possible  Unless you want blood on
your hands

How many people do you want jailed for their convictions for their
insistence on real privacy Why sit by quietly while the preconditions
for a real civil war are put in place by a shortsighted government

Read the above

   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and I'm worried
   that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
   and paper  

The terminal is mightier than the pen 

I type corrected  

Really I guess you mean the US revolution How about England
India Mexico France Holland

English revolution what revolution  They never had one  
India If they could get around their religion restrictions
Mexico Point Taken I forgot about this one  
France Napoleon Bonepart would have something to say about this
Holland I didn't know they had one won't comment because I don't know
enough

   That's not very good odds  

You are misinformed But this whole issue is off the topic

Actually I consider the issue on topic  When you start gambling with
fire crackers sooner or later somebody is going to lose a hand

When the cops kick in your door for using PGP tell them that All
we're doing here is exercising our socalled rapidly narrowing
right to free speech 

Fine  Exercise the right to free speech  That's great  But don't resort
to armed violence until there's no other possibility

Perhaps you should talk to the government about that Or are you a
disciple of David The cops are our FRIENDS Sternlight

No  I believe there are bad cops and good cops  There are bad people
and good people  And all that grey inbetween  

I have had the pleasure of knowing a police officer who did his best to
uphold the laws he swore to defend  I have also seen what happens when
police power is abused

Don't generalize in either direction  It just causes problems

The implied threat of the illegalization of private crypto the
notsosubtle subtext of the clipper announcement is what worries me
I don't want my children growing up in a police state

Me either  Nice can of worms ain't it

The point remains  More and more I see the government slowly washing
away privacy  Even unwittingly  Do you think I will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth  Do you think I
will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what I'm saying  Even if there is no evidence of my
guilt  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind  I'm tired
of it  There is IMHO no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy

More than the proposals themselves I read the language of the press
releases the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public and I am sickened  I am revolted  I am repulsed

 perhaps even  of this country could care less about the
clipper chip the wiretap bill the smart card because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration

This saddens and frightens me

I am a conserveative believe it or not  A law and order conserveative
But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me
mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the American people  Tell them it's going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists and they will let you
put cameras in their home

Even in the wake of Waco you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves

To be quite honest the way things are going I'd call it self defense

And I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera
 hours a day

I never advocated not saying what you believe in  I'm advocating second
thought and calm  

A smart warrior defeats the enemy in ambush on the battlefield
A smarter warrior defeats the enemy in open warfare on the battlefield
The smartest warrior defeats the enemy without using the battlefield

Think about it

 an hour He had access to rather powerful DES hardware but not of an
 extraordinare kind I believe The attack was possible because of the
 amount of known plaintext in the ticket which itself constitutes a small

That would be a V ticket presumably not a V ticket  The V ticket

Summary Re  Mark Seecof key escrow

From Mark Seecof markswimseylatimescom
Subject key escrow Clipper Chip RISKS 

Advances in digital computing have made it possible for ordinary people to
use powerful machine cipher techniques

It is tempting albeit chauvinistic to believe that we have a new situation
here thanks to our pet computers  This is not true  David Kahn's The
Codebreakers a history of cryptography makes two things obvious

	Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals
	and has been going on for thousands of years  Teenage slang and
	cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous
	creation

	The systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as and
	sometimes more secure than those used by military and diplomatic
	users of that time although they seem very simple and insecure
	today eg In places the Bible used a more complex simple
	substitution than Caesar did for his military dispatches but before
	Caesar

I commend Kahn's book to all who might be interested

Wow assurances from the President  Why those are almost as good as
campaign promises  I don't see why ANYONE wouldn't have confidence in
those

I don't think mr Clinton can even understand the technical details of

 If some kind soul out there would write a letter and upload it to

out to their local congressional critter

BTW I'm working on one

You should realize that form letters are the worst way to influence
your congresscritters exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest
rung of the opinion ladder

If you want to write and I think you should take the time to really
write a letter  Things to emphasize

	 It's been said that Usenet is available to the 'technical
	  elite' ie the techies at corporate sites and universi
	  ties  Emphasize that you are part of the group that will
	  be makingdevelopingusing Clinton's 'data superhighway'

	 Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing
	  and data communications if this is the case don't call your
	  self an 'expert' after wiring in a  bps modem   This
	  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers  Don't
	  turn it into braggadocio just tell them that you know the
	  technical sides of the issue

	 Don't overdo jargon and gobbledygook  Remember your letter
	  will be first read in all likelihood by a staffer who may
	  even be a college student if they don't understand it your
	  views won't even make the 'running total' sheets

	 Be concise don't ramble  Rants are definitely out of place
	  Cite references if necessary but only use accepted references
	  like academic journals  My neighbor Jim is not a real refer
	  ence  

	 Unfortunately very few Congresscritters really understand
	  electronic communications  Encourage them to pick up access
	  to Compuserve America Online or one of the FreeNets  Offer
	  to send them samples  If you are in a position to do so offer
	  them or their staffers back in the home state access to your
	  systems  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in
	  town  Your offer to get personally involved in helping them
	  will give your opinions more credence

	 In addition to sending mail to your representatives send mail
	  to the members of the committee or subcommittee that is dealing
	  with the issue  If your Congresscritter isn't on the committee
	  they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor

Wes

ps I'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the
    more traditional media but Usenet doesn't have a decent track record
    in the analogy department

There is one point I'd like to make that most people seem to have forgotten
That is that one of the underlining principles in the Constitution is a DISTRUST
of governmental authority and control All those checks  balances is because
they realize that you should distrust those in power What everyone seems to have
forgotten as well is the original reason that the Bill of Rights guaranteed the
right to bear arms It's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself
against other citizens but to prevent the government from taking away your only
means of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government Its hard to
oppress your citizenry when its armed against you

I've heard he doesn't read altfanrush
But I have no idea of a Compuserve email address

Does anyone have Rush Limbaugh's email address  Is there anyone out there
on Compuserve who might be able to look it up or otherwise find it
Maybe it would be impossible but I thought I should at least ask

 As a private citizen I would feel much more secure in my person and
 papers knowing that an organization committed to individual civil

 my key Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure
 by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported funded or
 overtly controlled by the government
 
Thats one problem that has so far been overlooked These two escrow
agencies will have to create a secure database and service the
input and output of Keys Who pays for this If they refuse an
illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their
budget by cut to punish them Will congress be forced to fund
them forever

The problem is that laws can change Congress may pass a law setting
up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private Some
future congress may change that law Suppose prenazi Germany had
a clipper system Do you think the escrow agencies would have
told Hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid 
court order

In effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of
the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance 
They will be able to directly tap into Federal funds with no
accountability to anyone except through a court challenge

 A person I know belonging to a research lab of a rivate
 company claimed to me during a priavte conversation that given the
 equipment in his lab he could crack a Kerberos ticket in  minutes to
 an hour He had access to rather powerful DES hardware but not of an
 extraordinare kind I believe The attack was possible because of the
 amount of known plaintext in the ticket which itself constitutes a small
 message This was two years ago
 DES is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data For a
 lot of purposes however it is still very adequate

This sounds an awful lot like a passwordguesser not a weakness in
DES  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper
that came out about  years ago in both Computer Communications
Review and Usenix  For that matter it was loudly discussed on the
Kerberos mailing list even earlier

The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES and everything to do
with bad password selection

I'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks
possible on DES  I'm quite dubious that private research labs know
them  And the parameters of a bruteforce attack are quite well
established see for example the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the
July ' Cryptologia  You're not going to do it in an hour with only
rather powerful DES hardware''  I'll leave the arithmetic as an
exercise for the reader  On average you'll need to do  trials
Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs and for
how many such engines are used

I came I lurked I read the FAQ

Now having purchased the recommended books and having taken to heart the advice that
one knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst I would like
to correspond with people interested in cryptology

I am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in Booch's OOD with
Applications I hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking
them  I would like to start with simple Ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to
David Kahn's book Of course I would be interested in general discussions and math also

I hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the
men in the suits I've been hearing so much about Unfortunately as a product of the American
education system I only know English

Looking forward to any and all responses

James

I've just spent  hours catching up on scicrypt here slow reader I
guess and I really have to put out a few comments too  First let me
flame the famous Dave S  He's obviously only  years old  Cut him
some slack 

The joke about Clintoncryptodrugs slammed me thru the roof  Nice job
guys  I've been working on marijuana legalization for over  years
now Clinton's actions so far have really helped  But because of
government action taken against various other groups I have developed
a  bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list
The Sboxes are the critical component and since I chose  out of 
based on the key cracking this DES is going to tough  The reason it
slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a
different set of sboxes I know it's only a vector but it sure makes
random search a pain  Several marijuana legalization groups have had
their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug
usesales  It's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org
but you will be watched

It really is important to write a letter to every official you
personally vote for to explain why your privacy is being destroyed by
the cripple chip  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get
enough mail  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real and
the IMI Illinois Marijuana Initiative has grown to the point where we
are seeing some changes

It's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the
implimentation decision being made behind our backs  As Vesselin
points out this was common practice in communist regimes and may be
again depending on how the vote goes  But just as criminals have guns
and law abiding citizens don't and criminals like me have marijuana
and law abiding subjects don't criminals like me will have secure
crypto while law abiding robots don't  PGP is nice but as time goes
on we all can do better  And to save our hides we will

Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli  He's my favorite dude
 years ago he saw clearly how people are and tried to explain
that to princes who wanted people to obey  One section not quoted
I've got The Prince at home so I'll just paraphrase   had to do
with conquring a free city  The only way is to completly destroy
it  Failing that you must appoint locals to high positions and accept
the people's customs  Even after  years of oppression a people
will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive
government  And he gave an example  And that was  years before
Thomas Jefferson

There were questions about watching traffic  Only interesting traffic
is watched stuff that goes overseas and comes back stuff with keywords
like marijauana cryptography NSA  certain individuals who are known
subversives etc  It is easy enough to store all that traffic  So if
you know how to be subversive ie how to be unseen it's pretty easy
to go unnoticed for a long time  The stronger your crypto system and the
less you're noticed the better your chances of developing an organization
which can diseminate truth to the masses

Which gets me to the thread about a public encrypted conference
That's just silly  The first thing the feds do is send in an
infiltrator like Dave S and they know what you're doing  It will be
fun for teenagers and college students but for the real world it's
pretty pointless  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where
you get your marijuana

Guns drugs and crypto do have some commonality there are people in
government who want you to obey their rules  As Lundquist says in
altdrugs Live free or don't  Machiavelli pointed out that's just
how most people actually live inspite of appearences to the contrary
It's true that the decision to shove the clipper not the same thing as
Intergraph's down our throats violates the principles of what the
US was founded on but the government is full of idiotic robots
called bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might
think  Only really innocent read naive subjects of the US will be
hurt by this the rest of us criminals will live in secure freedom
de Toqueville pointed out  years ago that the tyranny of the
majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government

And given what I see government officials doing where I work Argonne
National Lab the level of stupidity makes Dave S look smart

   I wouldn't think so  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
   unsound to me

   Maybe so but it's quite common There are millions of Macintosh users who
   have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs Many have modems connected
   How do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen Answer
    Because you trust Apple
    Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
   destroy Apple's credibility forever

Then there's also
 Because it's NOT SECRET  If I want to I CAN go look at Apple's
copyrighted ROMs in a Mac so they're not keeping any secrets  
You don't even have to pry the top off the chip and use an electron microscope
you just have to read the data in memory and see if you can figure out what it means
Motorola object code isn't all that obscure  
Yes it's copyrighted so I can't go selling copies or using the copy myself
but I CAN see it and disassemble it

 They're not asking me to trust their honesty  They're asking me to
trust the quality of their assembly language programming 
but I can see for myself what the performance price and crashesday are
NSA an organization not known for its honesty or openness 
is asking me to trust them with my privacy but they won't trust me  Feh

the use of the technology could lead to inadvertently increased costs

private markets  Markey has ordered Brown to answer several questions
about security and cost concerns by April   Communications Daily

   Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for their new CDMA digital
   cellular phones They wanted to put strong crypto into them since they
   had the capacity The government decided to discourage them

   You're blowing smoke  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice lucrative overseas
   markets like Japan and the EC  The government told them don't do encryption
   if you ever hope to export this technology  The reason that CDMA doesn't
   have encryption is NOT because the Gmen came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door
   It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular
   is big enough for them  This is just the International Traffic in Arms
   Regulations all over again

Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas and
the government told them they wouldn't be allowed to export
so he's only blowing the same smoke you are 
Sure they probably could have made a US version and a noncrypto
export version and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house to
develop an overseas crypto ROM but that's getting pretty expensive

   No Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different
   stuff for domestic use vs export  Qualcomm isn't  So Cylink makes
   moneythat's capitalism comrade

Well some people like capitalism and others prefer free enterprise
they're different  Using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist

   Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this Better yet
   prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any  box with a
   sound card into a secure phone
   Someone this and someone that  If you think it's so easy why are
   you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it

Writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do
writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill
Developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized
but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you don't
have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff
Once the Pentium becomes widespread or the next generation of
sound boards has DSPs on it I suspect we'll see it happen
Maybe the vanilla Soundblaster is enough

On the other hand when John Aristotle Phillips was a junior at Princeton
trying to keep from flunking physics by doing a terrific term paper
his atom bomb design was good enough that it got classified
A few of the steps were derived from social engineering 
eg the name of the explosive but it was fundamentally sound and DID get an A

The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured This makes
the funding separate from government

It also has the neat side property that if the chip doesn't catch on the
scheme breaks down and the government is back to the drawing boards
assuming that they haven't prohibited alternatives in the meantime

In fact maybe this should be part of the official system Before the
government is allowed to move this past the experimental stage they
should have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption The
government is very fond of demonstration projects proving feasibility in the
use of government funds for social programsthey should have to make a
similar feasibility demonstration on economic viability cum acceptance

Meeting of the UK Cryptoprivacy Association
 

Saturday  May  

To be held at the offices of

  FOREST
  th floor
   Grosvenor Gardens
  London  SWW DH

This is located at the corner of Hobart Place a couple of
blocks west of Victoria Station and almost directly across from
the dark green cabbie shelter

If you have trouble finding the place please call the office on
  Or call me Russell Whitaker on my pager
 and leave an informative message with the
telephone number where you can be reached I will return the
call almost immediately

Discussion will range from the usual general topics such as the
use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data to
specific topics such as recent moves by the US government
to restrict choice in data privacy reference recent discussion
on Usenet groups eg scicrypt and altsecuritypgp

All are invited  Particularly welcome are members of the
newlyformed UK CommUnity group  the local
EFFinspiritifnotinname folks

Those who plan to attend should email me and let me know
Please

All attendees are requested to bring diskettes  preferably
MSDOS  with their PGP  public keys  As is usual at these
gatherings several of us will bring our laptops and will sign
public keys subject to the usual caveats reference the
documentation for PGP  specifically files PGPDOCDOC and
PGPDOCDOC

If you do not already have a copy of PGP  MSDOS and would
like to have a copy of this public domain program please bring
a formatted medium or high density  inch floppy PC diskette
you will be provided a copy of the program

Of course you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from
one of the various archive sites  I suggest trying Demon
Internet Systems which carries the full range of PGP Phil
Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy implementations directory
pubpgp at gatedemoncouk

Meetings are of indeterminate time  Those who are interested
are invited to join the rest of us at a pseudorandomly
determined pub afterwards

Please note
 
In the past few months interested people have emailed me
requesting FAQs and special information mailings  I regret
that except in very unusual cases eg working press I
cannot in a timely manner respond to these requests  I will
however  and for the first time  do a writeup of this meeting
which I will post in various places

What I am willing to supply is general information on our
activities for the maintainers of existing FAQs such as that
for altprivacy  FAQ maintainers can contact me at

Something similar has happened to me  ages ago when we were working on PGP
we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test 
new features around  Now at this time PGP and certainly the newer version
was unknown over here  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received
a request that I stop sending encrypted email  Now there is almost no way
that some automatic scanner could have found this since they wouldn't have
known about PGP  they must have checked for unknown data types in the
message tried to unscramble it found they couldn't get past the PEM
armour part and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop  Luckily
the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their
networks 

Is the sending of encrypted traffic without government permission legal in

 Each chip includes the following components

    the Skipjack encryption algorithm
    F an bit family key that is common to all chips
    N a bit serial number this length is subject to change
    U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip
  

 To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the ATT
 telephone security device as it will be  Suppose I call someone and
 we both have such a device  After pushing a button to start a secure
 conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key K
 with the device at the other end  This key negotiation takes place
 without the Clipper Chip  In general any method of key exchange can
 be used such as the DiffieHellman publickey distribution method

 Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to
 encrypt the conversation or message stream M digitized voice  The
 telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
 values

    EM K the encrypted message stream and 
    EEK U  N F a law enforcement field  
  

 which are transmitted over the telephone line  The law enforcement
 field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
 concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family
 key F  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
 an authorized wiretap has been installed

One very interesting thing I notice about this is that the only use of
the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field
It is not used at all by the encryption algorithm

It seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be
otherwise compatible but would send out a bogus law enforcement field
This might render the device unusable with normal devices if there's
some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field but it
could certainly be used with other such modified devices

Of course this is irrelevant if the NSA has a backdoor in the
algorithm but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system

My original post was

I am building an oracle v database to serve as a repository for
information which is considered proprietary or confidential As such
I want to verify the security of oracle passwords and apply some of
the same security checking techniques we use on our nix systems
Specifically I would like to use Crack or something like it to check
the encrypted data for easily guessed passwords

The use of 'Crack' would depend on oracle using the unix password
encryption scheme does anyone know if this is the case or what
method is used

Any other methods for security checking  audit in the oracle
environment would be much appreciated

This article will just scratch the surface of a few security
considerations comments are requested email fwworldstdcom
My thanks to the people who responded both on usenet and from
Oracle Corp

The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit 
features or OPS passwords to control access opinion on OPS
included suggestions to use and not use I was also advised to 
use table views to refine the granularity of access control

One important security consideration in networked installations
is that OPS accounts presume that the client host provides user
authentication Os server OPS users are only as secure as the 
least secure machine on the network Hence you should probably 
not define any OPS accounts on systems with PC's or limit access 
of OPS accounts to data with no security concerns Unix oracle 
servers provide for disabling OPS access over the network orasrv
option while relying on host security for local processes 

Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented sic 
audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and
data access These tools can be used to track the primary security
risks from within the Oracle environment

Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES
encryption Oracle Corp states that the algorithm is not prone
to cleartext attack This is a difficult claim to substantiate 
since the algorithm is unknown The concern here is that if users 
choose easily guessed passwords If a cracker can gain access 
to your oracle database files through the host operating system 
she could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply 
cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords

As security risks go the above scenario is pretty low severity
Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files
she can access to the data in them If a cracker could break 
the passwords however she could do substantial damage without
alerting the auditing mechanism's and leaving and audit trail
which would point to valid users At present Oracle like Unix
provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not 
guessable 

As with all computer security the most important defense is to 
educate users in the safe choice of passwords These techniques
are well discussed in internet rfc and the Crack manual 
both available from ftp archive servers and UNIXR System

I wouldn't think so  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
unsound to me

Maybe so but it's quite common

Not when your talking about cryptography

There are millions of Macintosh users who
have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs Many have modems connected
How do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen Answer
 Because you trust Apple

Think again  You won't see me using apple's new signature from the
finder feature

 Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy Apple's credibility forever

This analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two
squirts about credibility


In addition Apple's proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh wasn't
survellience

Quite the opposite
On January  Apple will introduce Macintosh and you'll see why
 won't be like ''

So don't give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to
put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more


In the Clipper case a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it and we'll have assurances maybe even from the President that
other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors While some may not
have confidence in that I am not among them it's a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life

One of the reasons we should be all the more suspicious  When was the
last time the president wasted his time to comfort americans
Just another reason to look closely at exactally what's going on

OK I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption
export through the ITAR  Here's a question  Say I develop this great new
encryption system and I want to sell my software worldwide  The thought
police then come in and say This algorithm is a threat to national security
You will not be permitted to export it  At this point what kind of trouble
could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international
customers anyway

then ask him for them

Most use of probably cause wiretapping warrants isn't to decrypt historical
traffic but for prospective listening once probably cause is established
Pat's approach would tip off the crooks

Stikes me that all this concern over the government's ability
to eavesdrop is a little overblown what can't they do today
My understanding is that they already can tap listen get access
exc to our phone lines bank records etc etc again

Well they can't listen in on much of mine since I already use
cryptography for much of my electronic mail and will start using it
for my telephony as soon as practical

However allow me to tell a parable

There was once a far away land called Ruritania and in Ruritania
there was a strange phenonmenon  all the trees that grew in
Ruritainia were transparent Now in the days when people had lived in
mud huts this had not been a problem but now hightech wood
technology had been developed and in the new age of wood everyone in
Ruritania found that their homes were all  see through Now until
this point no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on
someone's home but the new technology made this tempting This being
a civilized country however warrants were required to use binoculars
and watch someone in their home The police taking advantage of this
would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going
on Occassionally they would use binoculars without a warrant but
everyone pretended that this didn't happen

One day a smart man invented paint  and if you painted your house
suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will Things
would go back to the way they were in the old age  completely
private

Indignant the state decided to try to require that all homes have
video cameras installed in every nook and cranny After all they
said with this new development crime could run rampant Installing
video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability 
they are just keeping the old one

A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the
lives of the police easy that the police had survived all through the
mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will and that
Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was
expedient was permitted For instance in a neighboring country it
had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to
solve crimes Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its
expedience Indeed why have warrants at all he asked if we are
interested only in expedience

A famous paint technologist Dorothy Quisling intervened however She
noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating
should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards
and the law was passed

Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths
while speaking to each other thus preventing the police from reading
their lips through the video cameras This had to be prevented the
police said After all it was preventing them from conducting their
lawful surveilance The wise man pointed out that the police had never
before been allowed to listen in on people's homes but Dorothy
Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of
covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and
mutilation of children No one in the legislature wanted to be accused
of being in favor of mutilating children but then again no one
wanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked so a
compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with
microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras The wise man
lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old
lip reading technology but it was too late  the microphones were
installed everwhere

However it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent
citizens from hiding information from the authorities because some of
them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not
understand A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at
all times only in Ruritanian and for good measure to require that
they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones After all
Dorothy Quisling pointed out they might be using the opportunity to
speak in private to mask terrorist activities  Terrorism struck
terror into everyone's hearts and they rejoiced at the brulliance of
this new law

Meanwhile the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all
of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania of which
all Ruritanians were proud Why he asked are we obligated to
sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police
easier There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in
crime anyway All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state

However the wise man made the mistake of saying this as the law
required in Ruritanian clearly and distinctly and near a
microphone  Soon the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived
and took him off and got him to confess by torturing him Torture
was after all far more efficient than the old methods and had been
recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene
thoughts about tomatoes which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the
major problems of the new age of plenty and joy

    I believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the
    country without an export license Others will correct me if
    this is inaccurate

   Glad to  You are correct it is illegal to send cryptographic
code and lots of other things out of the country without a license
HOWEVER every US citizen has a general export license allowing
export of lots of things including constitutionally protected speech
This has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some
things which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without
first obtaining a license

    Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have the only
    way to find out is to apply for a license

   Nope talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law  But in
general the government has to have a very good national security case
to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to
publish  Yes I worded that the way I did intentionally  It is a
lot easier for the government to TRY to prevent the export of
information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact
Espionage is probably the only exception

    Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send
    to Canada if YOU have such a license and what is legal to send
    if you don't

    If you are a US citizen you have a general license  I am not a
lawyer so take some of this with a grain of salt  However I have
also had to swim through both ITAR and export regs in a few cases

Well isn't this just a hoot   All I read on this group is a bunch

Please if we're going to hold our govt which admittedly has had and
still has its problems to high standards then mustn't we follow these
too  Electronic Freedoms only go so far

Again  I'm extremely sorry about this  I got this message several 
months ago quite a bit before the clipper chip proposal when it was posted
to a different newsgroup  It was very startling to me as well and I guess
I should of verified the source at least to some extent before reposting

Well I'm not a lawyer but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue

The US does NOT have an official secrets act We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official contractor etc and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information However if they
sell you the chip I can't see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish
but there are certainly exceptions  If you write a paper which includes
sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon it is
classified  As I understand the law nuclear weapons design is
automatically classified even if you do the work yourself  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper

Oh What about the precedent in which nuclear weapons information was
published in The Progressive I was under the impression that the
court held that prior restraint could NOT be used Any lawyers out

As one of the happily sleeping people I would just like to ask this
aren't people just slightly overreacting to this  Or are we all of a
sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia

The point of the matter is that yes this is a serious problem  But it is
not the end of the world  Guess what  We're doing something now you
can't do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany  We're complaining about
it or rather you're complaining about it and nobody is shooting at us  

We would like to keep it that way Thats the point By reacting
strongly and forcefully now we will assure that we continue to remain
free You cannot overreact to a threat like this The worst that
happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort The worst that
happens if we underreact is tyranny I prefer overreaction myself

GUESS WHAT PEOPLE  You live in one of the few countries in the world
where a person can complain without getting shot at  

Doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is

Only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain
ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom I suggest that
overreacting now and in the future is a good thing

   I've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints
I have about the Clipper chip  Pass a law stating that if within a
year of performaing a wiretap on someone a police agency hasn't
managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrantwiretap was for
then that agency owes the suspect  million to repay himher for
lost privacy
   Of course there are still problems with the technical aspects of
Clipper and with the onesizefitsall mentality that would be behind
an attempt to enforce it as a standard  But this would be a way for
those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will
only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are
all but certain that there really will be a conviction

Some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is
listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages
somehow if nonescrowed crypto goes away

A little perspective might be in order

The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low Law enforcement has to
present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
authorizations

Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
recorded by the government and for that to happen they have to
a Have a pretty good reason with evidence
b Use this sparingly on highest priority pretty good reasons

Though the system may be imperfect it is a long way from the horror stories
some here seem to believe or anticipate

	Again we have the trust in government problem here Members of 
Mr Sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which
members of my generation find ridiculous I would suggest that Mr Sternlight
read about the COINTELPRO program or about J Edgar Hoover or about
the wiretapping of Martin Luther King then after he has digested this
information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not
tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations
that they have no right to even under their own laws Given the long
history of members of the US government ignoring the laws that apply
to them it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid and
given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these
individuals once they are discovered it is no wonder that so many people
in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for Clipper

A messagedigest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a
digest'' of fixed length and has three properties Computing the
digest is easy finding a message with a given
digestinversion''is hard and finding two messages with the
same digestcollision''is also hard Messagedigest algorithms
have many applications including digital signatures and message
authentication

RSA Data Security's MD messagedigest algorithm developed by Ron
Rivest citerfcmd maps a message to a bit message digest
Computing the digest of a onemegabyte message takes as little as a
second  While no messagedigest algorithm can yet be em proved
secure MD is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps
to a bit digest  Inversion should take about 
operations and collision should take about  operations  No
one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision

Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers citedenboermd presents
a special kind of pseudocollision'' in MD's
internal compression function which maps
a bit message block x and a
bit input state s to a bit output
state They show how to find a message block x
and two related input states s and s that yield the same
output state fxs  fxs Their wellthought approach
exploits structural properties of the collision function to find 
a pseudocollision in about  operations much less than one
would expect

Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of
MD are not evident While a real collision in MD implies a
pseudocollision or a pseudoinversion'' a
pseudocollision need not imply a real collision Indeed a real
collision since it involves two different messages would almost
always involve em different message blocks x and x such that
fxs  fxs but the pseudocollisions have the same
message blocks Moreover the input states s and s would
generally be unrelated but the pseudocollisions' input states are
the same except for four bits  There does not seem to be any way to
extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the
special pseudocollisions a limitation they readily admit

It is reasonable therefore to believe that MD remains secure While den
Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in
MD the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions
and not anything approaching real collisions Further research of
course will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD and
other messagedigest algorithms with the eventual hope that
such algorithms can in some sense be proved secure

In article strnlghtCyBKADpnetcomcom strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight 
brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate
It's an important issue especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service 
I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys

   The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured 
   This makes the funding separate from government

But who's the user paying the fees here and what's the service  
If the user is the government then the funding's not separate from the government

If the user is the buyer what's the service  
Keeping the key for me  No thanks  I don't need and won't buy their service
Not telling everybody my key  Sounds like blackmail

If the user is the manufacturer does the user have a choice about buying
The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it which is fine 
I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key

Face it the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want
The only people who want it are the government not the users
What you're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service up front or peryear either from general taxes
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips or on an indirect tax
forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent

I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number especially if the escrow is a government agency

Here in New Jersey we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees  There are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee though sometimes people
refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective
If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium there are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee
Something could scratch the paint after all
And what a shame if your Clipper key got out

What is the reason for the push on clipper

Two days after the lead story here in the Mercury Times murky news
there was another article on industrial espionage by the french

Someone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have
continued access to our communications they already have it  The
problem is that yes the do have access and probably more than
we realize  The government wants exclusive access to communications
intercept here in the united states cutting out other access detrimental
to the national security tm

I also doubt that a certain letter agency that originated the encryption
algorithm and the chip designs needs to have anything to do with the 
escrow system to continue their intercept effort  

Better yet who owns the company doing the programming

The keys could be kept under glass with hour CSPAN coverage  If you

   OK I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption
   export through the ITAR  Here's a question  Say I develop this great new
   encryption system and I want to sell my software worldwide  The thought
   police then come in and say This algorithm is a threat to national security
   You will not be permitted to export it  At this point what kind of trouble
   could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international
   customers anyway

First of all it's not the thought police it's the export police
If you move overseas with your great thoughts in your head write the software there
and then sell it the US Thought Police probably can't do too much about it
though you might want to check with your lawyer first

However if you write the program here and sell it to furriners
you are now an international arms dealer and can get thrown in the
clink for many years especially if they decide you'd be a good example
and Cuban Drug Dealers and Fanatic Middle Eastern Terrorists buy your stuff

Definitions of public domain are different for ITAR purposes so if
you've got a good enough lawyer who'll do your case for free after
they've confiscated everything you own as evidence you might win
But nobody wants to go first since the stakes are quite high

     We are strongly opposed to the clippercapstone chips  In a
press release today our president Dr Stephen Bryen stated

          It seems as if the government has an unlimited source
     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American
     Public  But do we not understand how the National Security
     Agency which is not supposed to be involved in domestic
     spying can fund the development of a commercial chip
     intended to accommodate US government domestic spying
     activities


	Well actually this one's easy It's their job The NSA is
supposed to develop cryptosystems If the government chooses to go
ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses so be it

	This sounds a lot like slamming the competition not a cry
for justice These guys are way out on a limb if I read that right
They've commited their new algorithm to silicon before it's been
made public What are they gonna do if Shamir writes a paper showing
how to crack the entire class of algorithms in  minutes with a slide
rule and a pencil

	If they weren't busy throwing muck to smear their competitors
I'd feel kinda sorry for 'em Still do a little

 Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
 digital speech down K  I think it is I've heard it's not  Lets
 say  bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
 be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

 As far as I know ISDN call it Swissnet here and it's being plugged in it's
  bit Hz gives you one channel of kBitsec I guess you should not go
 below a sampling rate of  Hz if you want to have same quality as on an
 analogline Anybody knows compressionalgorithms  factors for voice 

I've posted some info on CELP coding on scicrypt  Looks like you can
squeeze speech into bps if you have a fast enough computer like a
sparcstation or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it  

This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run
speech over tcpip running on top of slip down a vbis modem  Not only
will this let us run point to point encrypted speech it'll let us
run speech internationally over the internet if noone stops us by
getting very heavy about regulations  The thought of this if the
administration realised would probably scare them shitless

Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol
for internet speech damn fast allowing anyone who feels brave to
inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our
workstations  Shouldn't be too difficult  The CELP stuff is standardised
we use tcpip streams and a protocol allowing silences to be used to
catch up on any net lag and also to avoid sending any data during
silences ie it's not wise to be synchronised realtime on each end
because any net delays would add up to big voicelags

As for me I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as
I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone
It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night 
whether encrypted or not

You know surely someone is working on this  Who  It's so obvious
why doesn't it exist already  I've only seen netphone for Suns and
it didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections

If the administration really believes bigtime drug dealers are the threat

Khufu and Khafre are both patented   Biham and Shamir showed
that differential cryptanalysis can break round Khafre with a chosen
plaintext attack using  different encryptions  Khafre with  rounds
can be broken with the same attack using  different encryptions
There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks if
someone wants to take the time to look

Khufu has keydependent Sboxes and is immune to differential cryptanalysis
Source code for this algorithm and Khafre are in the patent

Snefru is a publicdomain oneway hash function  The version of Snefru
that produces a bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis
vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force for
four passes or less  Given that SHA and MD are much more efficient

Oh yes anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre

Yes but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to
go back and use the phone with the new key instead of the phone whose
key they obtained

It is unclear whether obtaining the key at time  also unlocks
messages recorded by whomever at earlier times The announcement was
silent on this The betting seems to be that once your key has been
obtained by the authorities by divorce lawyers by the Mafia by the
FBI by lost or stolen backup tapes by the NSA etc all previous
conversations are unsecure Session keys are negotiated but knowing
the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the
security No doubt more details will emerge

So the loss of a key whether one is guilty or innocent may mean a lot
more than merely replacing the phone

Sort of like saying to someone Oh I copied your diary But I'll buy
you a new one


And the system if made mandatory as I expect will make such
storing of conversations much easier I fear For one thing the
transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone
listening a kind of Caller ID and Callee ID on a grand scale
Also the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the
privacy of the calls as they perceive them all to be useless
encrypted junk This is a bit of a reach I know suggesting that the
Clipper will make security more lax

Anyway still lots of issues unresolved

 You obviously haven't read the information about the system The chips
 put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow
 themselves to be identified The system does not rely on registering
 people as owning particular phone units
 
 I am against the proposal but lets be accurate in our objections
 

Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read  The system may
not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units but
it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some
suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys
from escrow  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's
coercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone

I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument
The original title perhaps should have been Distinction between legal
and illegal cipher systems considered harmful but Clipper considered
harmful is not inaccurate and is more eyecatching in the current context

Assumptions

    Clipper is made available

    Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal
      either on radio systems or on any common carrier system  These laws
      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio
      spectrum or other medium characterize signals validate Clipper
      wrappers detect probable use of nonClipper ciphers and make such
      detection a cause for further action

    For escrowed keys to be useful some specific Clipper chip must be
      associated with a suspected criminal  This means that at a minimum
      some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID ESN and
      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database
      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a
      red flag

    To reduce ordinary fraud the cellphone system which offers Clipper
      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamperproof
      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones

    Criminals want inscrutable communications  Some criminals are not
      entirely stupid or ignorant and will figure out both that Clipper
      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances and that
      they offer no security against law enforcement once a presumably
      legitimate wiretap order exists  They will also figure out that the
      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone because
      each one has a unique unit key

    Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves  Because they
      are not stupid or ignorant or because they read netnews and because
      they know that their open use of a nonClipper cipher is likely to be
      detected they will generally avoid using nonClipper ciphers directly
      on some monitorabletappable channel  They know that do so would raise
      a red flag putting a given cellphone if not a given person under
      immediate suspicion

    It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack discover family key F
      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip

By    and  it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper
phone without immediate detection  Because it is difficult to obscure one's
association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips
around the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is
associated with someone else

A nonstupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clippersecure
communications at least for some limited time T if they buy beg borrow
or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from
reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T  The encrypted
communications might have been recorded and thus be retrievable later
but the criminal can delay and quite likely evade discovery by destroying
or abandoning the phone before T elapses

It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper
phone to someone else  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone
else's bill and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion

This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use coercion
and collusion

Coercion first  Theft bears a relatively low risk but also sometimes
a low time until detection a few minutes if a phone is stolen from
a car parked in front of a store a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen
from someone who is away on vacation  Criminal commerce is likely to
arise in stolen Clipper phones with phones coming from riskinured poor
criminals and cash coming from riskaverse wealthy criminals  Someone
who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected
communication like a terrorist could kill a person or hold them hostage
The limited time before detection that a coerced phone is useful means
that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of
freshly coerced phones

There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively
wealthy criminals and ignorant or don'tcare patsies who need money
and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper
phone service for someone else's use

Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a
Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a nonClipper cipher to a normal
cellphone  They will call much less attention to themselves or at least to
their stolen phone this way  The fact of a phone's use being coerced must
first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone and
have its keys obtained from escrow

Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of superencryption  An automated fullsystem surveillance
mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key F
can validate Clipper wrappers and NESN associations but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of superencryption unless it knows all unit keys
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces upon specific wiretaplike order

Whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium
would stand out a criminal's use of a nonClipper cipher within a Clipper
medium would be very difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk
recordings as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper
chip is fractured

If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se then you can charge
the criminal with this if you can identify the true criminal  he'll be
using someone else's phone but you'll have no evidence to help you against
whatever traditional crime he might have been planning  You will not even be
able to detect that unusual encrypted communications are occurring until you
identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow

The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more not less secure than
they were before Clipper came along

I therefore consider Clipper harmful because

    It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against
      aggressive or dishonest government

    If other ciphers are proscribed it engenders new types of direct
      criminal threat to the honest public

    It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to
      hide their use of some other cipher making it more difficult than
      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring
      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress

    If other ciphers are proscribed lazy investigators and prosecutors
      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipheruse crime
      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key
      escrow is claimed to help against

    If other ciphers are proscribed the stage is set for witch hunting
      of illegal cipher use  Because any computer can be used as a cipher
      machine

something that no one has discussed yet or I missed it

The FBI sets up a wiretap AFTER the court order was handed 
Only at this point they can access the line and detect 
the serial number N

What happens next does the FBI simply asks for the keys
for N and since a warrant was issued for the line the FBI 
simply gets it What if multiple phones are used from the
same house the FBI just asks for N N etc

Exactly who is to prevent the FBI from claiming some
other serial number X was also used over the wirtapped 
line and get the keys for X 

Either a second court order for the specific serialkey
is required and I have seen no indication of this or
the FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any
time so the escrow key holders are a total fake

An unrelated issue if and when all phones always use
the clipper chip how are calltransfers going to take 
place

	  The points raised about checking what is actually in the chip as

	time to reduce the key search space to  bits I assume they are not
	doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
	at carefully selected points to encode data  They would presumably be
	punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program
	the chips in a manner completely independent of the S and S values they
	are feeding into the system

S and S are clearly the backdoor  we should assume they are all
compromised  If they're not compromisable why the hell not use a
hardware true random number source  There isn't a random number
source anywhere in this proposal  The whole thing is deterministic
from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip

Nope it can't be trusted  This is all about two levels of access 
the possibly honest key escrow that police forces have to use and
ostensibly the FBI and the back door that lets the NSA decode everything
on the fly  and maybe some backhanders to the FBI when they want a
warrantless tab in exchange for favours

 There are chips which perform the voice compressionexpansion  They can't
 be expensive because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the
 PBX line cards as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses
 voicegrade circuits to save the cost of longdistance leased Ts or
 satellite circuits

 I can't remember the generic term for these chips  My impression is that
 this was a big deal  years ago but circuits have gotten so cheap that
 it isn't done much now

Codecs  They have to get about  compression on  bit samples to squeeze
them down vbis  I played around with the lossless 'shorten' program
last night but it only managed   I've got some specimen CELP code
but it's not obvious that it runs in real time I think it's just proofof
concept code and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before
I can put my own sample through it

Looks like the current option is to use a voicemail modem with builtin
DSP chip to do this in hardware  That means two modems for a system
putting the cost at  upwards  Ouch  Maybe soon we'll be able to
do it in software on highpowered games consoles  isn't the DO an
Acorn RISC machine inside  That cpu runs like shit off a shovel and
will be nicely massmarket too

You forget the obvious If it is an authorised tap then it can be done at

automonitor a line and pickup the full link Therefore syncing a piggyback

I kind of doubt that any revolution armed or otherwise was ever started

  Each chip includes the following components
 
     the Skipjack encryption algorithm
     F an bit family key that is common to all chips
     N a bit serial number this length is subject to change
     U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip
   
 
  To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the ATT
  telephone security device as it will be  Suppose I call someone and
  we both have such a device  After pushing a button to start a secure
  conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key K
  with the device at the other end  This key negotiation takes place
  without the Clipper Chip  In general any method of key exchange can
  be used such as the DiffieHellman publickey distribution method
 
  Once the session key K is established the Clipper Chip is used to
  encrypt the conversation or message stream M digitized voice  The
  telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
  values
 
     EM K the encrypted message stream and 
     EEK U  N F a law enforcement field  
   
 
  which are transmitted over the telephone line  The law enforcement
  field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
  concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family
  key F  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
  an authorized wiretap has been installed

Is the U used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the
call from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first
or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field  Even assuming
one of the first two choices the FBI is going to get a fresh NU for its
own database about every other phone call eventually accumulating keys for
all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring not just
the 'suspects' key  Assuming the everthrifty FBI doesn't forget each key
after its wiretap permission has expired  Not quite a pyramid but not
bad either

While I have to congratulate EFF for its prompt response to the

to recognize the philosophy of their Executive Director as explained
below

I agree that legal remedies are important but when pressed I'd
prefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to

Mr Chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the Net

	Thank you for sending me a most interesting article   A
society of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the
time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to
avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother
obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever
present  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia

	As a matter of  principle  we  are  working  to  enact  formal
legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on
technical solutions   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which
respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the
law requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions  eg
require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data
communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption
that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power
and invade privacy

	As a  matter  of  practicality  I  do  not  think  your  system
offers much hope for privacy    First the trend toward universal
identifiers  is  as  mucha  movement  generated  by  government  or
industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by
citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions
At best  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most
would opt for  simplicity  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would
never use or benefit from it

	Finally where there's a  will there's  a  way If  government
wants to link data bases it  will  by  law require  the  disclosure
of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it
for data bases which the government wants to link      Since
corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one
another they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted
will use fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes
used by their customers to other firms

	The solution remains law policy and consensus about limits
on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual
autonomy  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to
override it It cannot be used as a substitute for such
consensus

I posted an informational request about any electronically available
articles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago  As I
mentioned I was interested in particular in DES and PublicKey 
but also wouldn't mind learning about others  As I said I can read
an intrograduate level text book having had some mathematics though
not much numbertheory per se  I'd like to see the technical details
of the mathematics of cryptography as oppossed to the popularizations
of things like scientific am which just say then you find a
really big prime number

Following my request several people were so kind as to suggest
readinglists which I hope to get around to  Two other people were
so very kind as to send large documents which I presume were actual
articles about  lines each but I've stupidly deleted them
accidentally before having a chance even to skim them  If they can
forgive me for my careless use of filecommands would the original
senders be so kind as to resend Or anyone else who has good
cryptoarticles at a fairly technical mathematical level Also
ftpable or gopherable docs would be nice to know about

Yours Lulu

Then it was either really good luck or you had some very fast

Yes I'm not very seriously bothered about the security of DES yet
though you might prefer to use triple DES or IDEA both of which
use more key bits

nobodyalumniccocaltechedu correctly states Jerry Berman's  view on
privacy but he mistakenly assumes that this represents Berman's  view as
EFF Executive Director

As one of the people who convinced Jerry that legal protections for privacy
are insufficient and that technical measures especially public key
cryptography are also vitally necessary I can tell you that Jerry and EFF
are fully committed to this position

The previous poster is apparently unaware of a long series of EFF positions in
support of this view  I suggest those interested read EFF's position on
Clipper or our other work in digital privacy  Check ftpefforg for more
details

One of the great things about human beings is that they are capable of change
and evolution in their thinking  The idea that crypto is critical to privacy
is one which is no longer limited to certain net afficianados but is 
spreading to parts of the public policy community in Washington

    The clipper chip's User key is formed by
  
            R  EDENSSS
            R  EDENSSS
            R  EDENSSS
  
    Why is the tripleencrytion used  Is it just to gain an effective
 increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch  If so why use
  bit keys  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm it's
 not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
 guess SS
  
    Why are N N and N formed as they are  It would be facinating to
 see the Skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require
 three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way
  
    Where do the bit constant values that are concatenated with the
 serial number to form NNN come from  Are they changed from chip to
 chip or session to session  Even if they're published in the NY Times
 if SkipJack is resistant to knownplaintext attacks when using triple
 encryption then there's no break in security  But why allow that kind
 of weird format  If those three bit values are trulyrandom bits then
 maybe it's used to ensure that a knownplaintext attack on SkipJack if
 it exists can't be easily used to derive S and S for a whole production
 run of these chips

I can't answer all our questions in detail but I can take a stab at
them

The form the operations that compute R R and R is of course the
famous triple encryption'' suggested for use with DES  It's much
stronger than a single encryption and has an effective key length of
 bits  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first
standardized a simple double encryption would not have the same
strength  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less
the beginning to encrypt other keys  It's recommended for anything of
very high value  And I think we can agree that the Ri and Si fit
that description

Why n n and n  Well you need different plaintext values  I
have no idea if they'll be disclosed or not  At a guess they're
constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible
A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a bit change
 but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit
patterns and there might conceivably be a weakness  So the ni
values are  and I'm guessing  chosen to increase the Hamming
distance

In any event I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the Si
from the Ui let alone U  Observe  if the NSA has U they don't
need to find Si  But even if they do they can't get U and U  In
theory they should never even see those values even with a warrant

The real question I think is why use this scheme at all as opposed
to a hardware random number generator  My answer is that this is
much more verifiable  Look  suppose that NSA NIST the ACLU the
EFF and the NRA combined to build a really good random number
generator and that it passed every test you could think of  When you
come back next week to program some more chips does it still work that
well  Have any components changed in value  Have the components been
changed out from under you  Does it still work well the in the
presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards
selecting  bits  Yes you can run detailed statistical tests on it
again but that's hard

Consider on the other hand a software solution  You bring your own
floppies with you you can run cryptographic checksums etc  It's a
lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged in other words
Yes I can think of ways to cheat software too  I think that they're
a lot harder

There are three issues with Clipper  The first is whether or not the
architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working  My answer
with one significant exception is yes  I really do think that NSA and
NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that
their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping under
certain carefullycontrolled circumstances with a minimum risk of
abuse  The exception is that U exists outside of the chip on a
programming diskette  That's seriously wrong  U and U should be
loaded onto the chip separately  To those who disagree and I don't
claim my answer is obvious though I found my own reasoning
sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions
section of my technical analysis paper  I had originally blasted the
scheme I issue this invitation  assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and
due process  What would you do differently  In answering this
question please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions  that both
strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap
some domestic users is necessary  If you feel it necessary to
challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue I
present below  Right here I'm discussing just the technical
aspects  And no I don't by any means claim that just because
something can be done it should be

The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually
going to be used  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't
mean that that's the only way they'll be made  Maybe the NSA will
substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the
shipping dock  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests so that
the escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called  Sorry
guys all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have
bought tripleDES phones instead  Who'd 'a' thunk it''  I have no
answer to this question and at the moment I don't see a way of
answering it  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer
to the final question below

The third and most serious issue is whether or not Clipper is a good
idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law
I think that the answer is no but it's not a nobrainer  I'm a civil
libertarian not a libertarian for reasons that I explained at great
length on the net in the Elder Days and that I don't have the energy
to repeat now  But that means that I'm willing to accept that some
laws are necessary so long as they respect the essential rights of
individuals  The government already has the ability and  in our
system  the right to issue search warrants and while that power has
certainly been abused it's also been used quite properly and fairly in
other cases  Is key escrow sufficiently different  I think so  but
again it's not an easy question for me  It is easy for libertarians
to answer of course since Clipper is completely alien to much of the
rest of their oftadmirable philosophy  And it's also easy for those
who give their unreserved trust to government a group I'm much more
distant from

  The only theory that makes any sense is that S and S are either the
same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers  about one billion multiplied by the number
of different S S combinations

Iff the phones transmit their serial nos as part of the message then what
is to say that each phone can take that serial number and use it to generate
the required key

 About  people so far have asked Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys
 won't they be able to read all your future and past traffic
 
 There has been no response from NIST NSA Ms Denning Mr Hellman or
 anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer
 This is troubling
 
 Didn't NSA think about this  Or is it a feature and they thought we
 wouldn't notice
 
 I would have thought that by now they would have responded with something
 of the form Well that won't be a problem because 

Don Alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to
comprisks  I'll present my variant on it instead since I feel it's a
bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat  depends on the
protocol that's followed for reading traffic  Briefly the cops get a
wiretap warrant and record the call  They then notice the encryption
and the disclosure header  It along with a copy of their warrant is
sent to the FBI or whoever it is who holds the family key  The
Fholder decrypts the header and sends the serial number N and the
encrypted session key UK to the escrow agents  They in turn use U
and U to recover K and send that to the local police

Note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever  Neither the
cops nor the FBI ever see U so they can't read other traffic  Every
request must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents  The
cops and the FBI together can't cheat since they don't have U  I
regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the
system  It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme  The
escrow agents can't read the conversation since they don't have it
all they have is N and UK  And the police don't even see N

It's harder to see how to block decryption of old warrantless
wiretaps  There is one protection  you have to persuade the escrow
agents that the call is current  But that's not nearly as strong
There are approaches I can see that might work involving sequences of
data on an unalterable medium complete with cryptographic protection
against insertion onto a new medium  But I don't have anything yet
that isn't too complex for comfort or too hard to install in the real
world  The NSA might have an answer they may or may not be smarter
than me but I've been working on this for a week and they've had years

Brad Yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a
phoneclipper relationship

It doesn't wash

Recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect's phone
calls They do what they do nowfigure out which lines to tap They then
record the stuff If it's Clipper they read the law enforcement block
extract the serial number and get the keys using the court order

No new difficulties such as using someone else's phone instrument or phone
line are introduced that wouldn't have existed absent clipper If the
crooks were going to use a pay phone say they could have done so without
clipper If the government figures out they're so doing they listen in and
if it's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys

If the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped line
there's no problem The Feds don't care whose phone instrument is used just
that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line They get the
serial number get the keys and they are in business

No clipper chip to person association is ever needed

I think it very unlikely there are back doors in clipper for two reasons

 The government doesn't need them if it can get the key and yes I assume
that the official government obeys court orders etcand that the design
of the chip and its approval were official

 It would defeat the whole purpose of providing secure crypto for American
business that couldn't be read by our economic adversaries If this were not
a legitimate and genuine purpose and as many think the NSA can read DES
why bother otherwise

something that no one has discussed yet or I missed it

The FBI sets up a wiretap AFTER the court order was handed 
Only at this point they can access the line and detect 
the serial number N

What happens next does the FBI simply asks for the keys
for N and since a warrant was issued for the line the FBI 
simply gets it What if multiple phones are used from the
same house the FBI just asks for N N etc

Exactly who is to prevent the FBI from claiming some
other serial number X was also used over the wirtapped 
line and get the keys for X 

Either a second court order for the specific serialkey
is required and I have seen no indication of this or
the FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any
time so the escrow key holders are a total fake


Two safeguards

 The FBI could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow
agencies and associate it with a particular court order

 If the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue
closely It is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal
wiretap is the person the court order covered

Putting it another way this question is not very different from the
preclipper question What's to prevent the FBI from getting a court order
to tap Al Capone and then using it to tap Jonathan Livingstone Seagull
instead

the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the
security No doubt more details will emerge


Doesn't matter if we assume they are obeying the law since they won't have
had a court order to tap calls prior to the date of the court order and
thus won't have them available

If they aren't obeying the law we are in an entirely different discussion
in which this is the least of one's worries

About  people so far have asked Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys
won't they be able to read all your future and past traffic

There has been no response from NIST NSA Ms Denning Mr Hellman or
anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer
This is troubling
 
   It was implied in the first technical posting by Dorothy Denning that the
FBI would do the decryption for the law enforcement agencies  It wasn't
clear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not or
whether the FBI would just decrypt the session keys for the locals or would
do the whole message
 
   One thing I'm a bit puzzled by  Why aren't they doing this with a public
key scheme of some sort  You could generate two uniqe publicprivate pairsor
for each chip  Then escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies  Set
the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys  To decrypt
a message both escrow agencies in the right order for most PK schemes
have to decrypt with the escrowed private key  This way there wouldn't be
thecconcern that once the police had asked fo  a warrantwiretap they
would have your key forver

 Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this

That was probably me
I meant only that nobody has overreacted yet  It seemed to me that
Jerry was suggesting that people are currently overreacting and I 
vehemently disagree  I see a lot of talk but not much action
I see now that I misunderstood Jerry's position

 The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
 In a new Civil War 

 Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and I'm worried
 that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
 and paper  

Not this bunch  They'll just bitch on the Net for a while and 
then go back to lurking

 Can people work within the system before trying to break it  Examine your
 history books and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
 or Democratic style governments  I think you'll only find one in over
 five thousand years of written history

Actually it's not quite that bad but it's close

I think everyone would just as soon work within the system  The presence
of the POSSIBILITY of using the bullet box instead of the ballot box
is supposed to be a deterrent  by keeping the price of massive abuse
unacceptable  However governments being what they are sure would
like to REMOVE that deterrence which will make the need for armed
citizens all the more great you don't need 'em till you don't have 'em
Then I think we can be more accurately called 'subjects' instead of
'citizens'  The idea of the people being sovereign over the government
is sure not in vogue in the Beltway these days that is for sure
The Administration is saying We know best  We will tell you what
you need or don't need  After that oldfashioned anachronism
called the Bill of Rights is not needed in these 'enlightened times'

Look we collectively have the power to throw the bums out but we
don't use it  We clearly don't need to go burning things down but we

Not if the government has its way  There are EIGHT bills before Congress
that will either ban tax exhorbitantly or register all useful weapons
in the hands of the unconnected US subject   Can you say  just
for a box of cartridges for practice  One of the current Administrations
top priority items is to disarm all who are not wellconnected or that
work for the government

clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out
Unfortunately the bums have learned to target only small groups of
people at a single time so the masses won't react and throw them out
Eventually the masses will react unless the bums cease their
relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy
The sooner it happens the less the damages will be  I don't want to
live in a war zone either  I want to see the bums thrown out before
they do some real damage

Another tactic is to toss out so many outrages at once that nobody can
give justice to them all  Like is being done RIGHT NOW

Steve Bellovin writes a wellthoughtout and nearly persuasive article about
why the Clipper are we still calling it Clipper today or have they figured
out a noninfringing word yet protocol is almost as good as one can do
given their marching ordes

In article Aprulyssesattcom smbresearchattcom Steven Bellovin writes
         I issue this invitation  assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and
due process  What would you do differently  In answering this
question please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions  that both
strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap
some domestic users is necessary

I'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument  In my
view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is
secret leading to suspicion that there is a back door  Without complete
disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled no matter how many trusted
experts are allowed to look at it in isolation

Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm  The only
concern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build
Clipperphones without registering the keys  Assume F can really be kept
secret as the Government assumes  Then as part of the initial connection
a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate
that they both know F  For example the initiating phone picks a number Q
and sends EQ F  The receiver sends back EQ F and the initiator
sends back EQ F to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a
random bit block  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so
it can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential
numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial
numbers of subsequent challenges  This way Clipperphones will talk only
to other Clipperphones  Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own
proprietary Skipjack phone but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that
they won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow

What's wrong with this picture  It depends of F staying secret and on
Skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis but the Government appears to
believe in both of these  Even if the particular QA I suggest has some
flaw I imagine there's a zeroknowledgeproof protocol that doesn't

smb says
The third and most serious issue is whether or not Clipper is a good
idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law

Agreed  My view and you can quote me if it's not worth doing it's
not worth doing well

Subject How To Escrow If Escrowing Were OK
Date  Apr   
Organization Express Access Online Communications Greenbelt MD USA

  There is a description of something called a fair crypto system in the
May  issue of BYTE p  attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali

  The way it works is as follows

  You generate your private key S and break it up into pieces s s s
s and s such that s  s    s mod p  S
  You give each piece s s etc to a different escrow agency
  The agencies each compute gsn mod p and forward the result to the public
key telephone book keeper
  The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the gsn mod p reduces
the result to mod p and this will be the user's public key

  Now if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies and the user
could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted the result would
be something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system

  I still don't think key escrow is a good idea for both philosophical and
security reasons but I do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether
escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good
faith or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected
for spinelessness in the face of official requests

  FEDS Well no but we have a warrant to tap Carlos SlimeDevil Gonzales'

No clipper chip to person association is ever needed

Yeah but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested
mistakenly and has their life turned upsidedown because some law
enforcement agency does make a chipperson association

I wonder if there are any plans to keep these records eg encode the
serial number into the UPC scanned at KMart along with the credit
card info voila

At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or
whatever ie to be coming from your telephone number the person
likely is in your house etc plus or minus some shenanigans of
course

But I'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id recording
the conversation then doing a quick crosslookup and your name comes
up as owner of that id mistakenly maybe you sold the phone at a
garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever They
might only know who one side of the conversation is for example

Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to crosscorrelate such
databases loses two points First law enforcement agencies can of
course do this Second they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any
money for it The IRS for example does do this anyhow They just
don't spend any money on it so it's technically legal I guess

Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like
mastercard if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a lot of
opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases

I know an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me from his screen I
could hear him typing to pull up each screen once on the phone during
a dispute I had with them to intimidate me actually not much of a
dispute I didn't particularly disagree but for some reason this
fellow wanted to play tough guy with me I hope he's better now

Amazing stuff he had at his finger tips Be afraid

How fast do the fastest modems go

The Shannon limit for voice lines is likely somewhere around kbps
We are rapidly approaching it The fastest affordable fullduplex
modems currently on the market are Vbis which is bps

How far can voice be compressed

CELP manages to sound decent at  bps

In theory if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice
into ASCII and a perfect synthesis system on the other end that
sounded just like the person you were speaking to you could get it
down to the information content of the speech

With various kinds of LPC you can get it down to  bps or prehaps
even less at which point it sounds horrible

 bps is more than adequite for our purposes

er excuse me but since the escrow agencies aren't yet chosen how can you
say they have a history of untrustworthy behavoirsic

I'm sure each of us can think of agencies without such a history Price

  ESCROW AGENT Well OK

No no no no no no no

It will go like this

FEDS We need the key to phone RED

ESCROW You have a warrant to tap the line phone RED is on

FEDS Yes

ESCROW Fine here is our key

What happens is Feds tap a line find Clipper is being used extract
serial number get key decipher convo  The serial number is never
registered to a specific owner it is sent as part of the
conversation  If I give you my Clipper phone you do not need to
reregister it mainly because it was never 'registered' to me in the
first place

There are a lot of things that bother me about Clipper but this is
not one of them  Let's get our facts straight and not waste effort

 On the other hand I can easily see them recording the traffic for
 interesting people such as dissidents suspected criminals
 foreign telephone calls and anybody noticed using encryption
 As Ken Shiriff speculates recording encrypted traffic will probably
 be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon 

As I read the current wiretap law it would not be legal now  On the
other hand assuming a legislative change recording but not decrypting
Clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the Supreme
Court using the same reasoning or the lack thereof by which they
permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers

Incidentally if we use that as our model the Court will likely not
uphold selective recording  On the other hand I don't think they've
thrown out drug courier profiles'' yet  Must be that exception to
the Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of
Rights

A lot  and I mean a lot  will depend on exactly how Clippertaps
or Tipperclaps for encrypted music are used  Don Alvarez showed in
the latest RISKS digest that it's possible to prevent the cops from
reading traffic after their warrant expires

That is  the cops send the LEF to the Fholder  The Fholder strips
off F and sends UKN to the escrow agents  They send either U or K
to the cops  Don says U I say K  The cops can't use U in the
future because they can't strip off F  The Fholder never sees U  In
Don's model the escrow agents can't read the traffic because they
don't have K in my model they have K but not the message itself
And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI the
Fholder are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules  The
net result is that by involving the Fholder and the escrow agents on
every tap we can avoid extending permission to tap

 The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured This makes
 the funding separate from government
 
 It also has the neat side property that if the chip doesn't catch on the
 scheme breaks down and the government is back to the drawing boards
 assuming that they haven't prohibited alternatives in the meantime
 
 In fact maybe this should be part of the official system Before the
 government is allowed to move this past the experimental stage they
 should have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption 

David

  While I disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government
I think you have a good idea here There is danger that with funding coming
from asset forfeitures the government could continue to promulgate a bad
product in spite of poor acceptance Making the product pay its way as
it must for private ventures would be a good incentive for quality and
listening to we the ranters

Another idea Use a laptop computer  As mentioned earlier the LCD screen

Two safeguards

 The FBI could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow
agencies and associate it with a particular court order

Exactly what would that show  the law enforcement block is easy to
create given the Government key and any serial number 

 If the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue
closely It is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal
wiretap is the person the court order covered

IF it comes to trail about the wiretap ya some safegaurd that is
What if they just harass people as a result or learn things they shouldn't
have learned etc 

Putting it another way this question is not very different from the
preclipper question What's to prevent the FBI from getting a court order
to tap Al Capone and then using it to tap Jonathan Livingstone Seagull
instead

The whole point of the Escrow system is to prevent the FBI from making 
illegal wiretaps Why not have the FBI holds the
keys and that's it Why do we need the escrow system at all

Unless a rd party a judge verifies that the requested serial number
is right and the FBI can get any key they like at anytime the escrow
system is useless

The problem is that this will also cause  a certain amount of interference
in all systems within the range of the device  A long time ago I built a

anyting ever done with these  Are Khufu Khafre andor Snefru still
being discussed anywhere  I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA
FAQ and I think it may also be in the scicrypt FAQ

The paper was distributed against the wishes of the NSA  I have a copy
with a few 'illicit distribution' footnotes scribbled on it  and eventually
published at one of the crypto conferences  Things were looking good

Then Xerox patented the algorithms  Plonk

I don't know of anything which uses them  Also Khafre was broken at a
later conference and from work on a related algorithm I don't think the
existing Khufu would hold up too well against a converted differential
cryptanalysis attack although it can probably be changed to resist this
type of attack

Depending on the encryption system so long as everyone has the same
key it can be done  For example I was using vat which is an
Internet Audio tool for a conference call and we were encrypting the
session  Unfortunately one site was doing more work and didn't
have the CPU for it so it didn't sound all that good at a different
site

So you don't neccessarily have to have a cleartext bridge  But if
you do its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the

I forwarded an old posting about CELP speech compression

I've since been told that the source of this is on cygnuscom

I'm not in a position to any Sun tcpip gurus out there who think they
can marry this with netfone by the end of the week   Seriously  I
think someone with real net access and two sparcs could have this running
by the end of the week  Then we ask the pgp guys to add a bytestream
crypto filter  Two weeks at the most  Damn I wish I had my sparc
back I'm stuck on a mhz sx

I tried this code yesterday  On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over
 seconds to compress  seconds' worth of speech  This means that it
needs to be optimized by over a factor of  before it will be usable
in even a halfduplex mode

I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application  It produces
great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads  We want
something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even highend PC's
without DSP cards  My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be
a better starting point

  Second question Why Why is such a strange procedure used and not
 a real RNG  This turns those SS in a kind of bottleneck for system
 security

  The only theory that makes any sense is that S and S are either the
same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers  about one billion multiplied by the number
of different S S combinations

My interpretation of Denning's description is that S and S are chosen
randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 
chip programming session  I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which
will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly  there would not be
a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some
people have envisioned

My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the
S and S using a specified algorithm provides an inprinciple checkable
way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers
used to generate the keys  Since we have to trust the escrow companies
anyway it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from
random seeds entered by the escrow agents  And since the algorithm for
keygeneration is public modulo Skipjack secrecy then in principle an
agent could challenge the procedure ask for S and S to be exposed and
run his own independent calculation of U and U to verify that that is
what is actually being put onto the floppies

And yes there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could
be hard to check  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each
time  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S and S entered by
the trusted escrow agents  Back doors in the chip could allow U to be
recovered  Heck each chip could be recorded with the same U ignoring
what was on the floppy

     Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece New Encryption
to scicrypt there has been some discussion of our company
Secured Communications Technologies Inc and on encryption
algorithm NEA

       The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from
Friedman

	No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes 
	from someone who has already broken a very hard one

Historically Friedman has been right  It's really hard to develop
a good cypher  IBM's Lucifer the precursor to DES turns out to have
been fatally flawed  Most of the DESlike systems other than DES seem
to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis  The first two tries at
public key encryption remember knapsack cyphers were broken  Most
if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were
broken eventually  Attempts in the computer era to homebrew encryption
have been disappointing the classic A survey of data insecurity packages
in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the
popular security packages of the late s

        A new proprietary algorithm  No way

        If the US is permitting general export of this thing it has
to be weak that's how the current regulations work  Currently there's
a willingness to allow systems with short keys  bits appears to be
no problem the  bits of DES are too many or weak algorithms
I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule to be exported
I can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the 
PTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out

 the basic idea behind any communications security system is not
to absolutely deny access but to make access more expensive in time
money manpower than it is worth

True of all security sytems I think and it is the fundamental measure to 
be used in establishing a requisite security level

I tried this code yesterday  On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over

Ouch  Thanks for trying it

I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application  It produces
great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads  We want
something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even highend PC's
without DSP cards  My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be
a better starting point

Yes  I'm not sure if my xposting to compspeech made it to here too but
I've found that a low sample rate  samplessec at  bits per sample
plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get
speech into K with a simdgen left over  This is definitely worth
working on folks  And shorten works in well under realtime

That is  the cops send the LEF to the Fholder  The Fholder strips
off F and sends UKN to the escrow agents  They send either U or K
to the cops  Don says U I say K  The cops can't use U in the
future because they can't strip off F  The Fholder never sees U  In
Don's model the escrow agents can't read the traffic because they
don't have K in my model they have K but not the message itself
And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI the
Fholder are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules  The
net result is that by involving the Fholder and the escrow agents on
every tap we can avoid extending permission to tap

I've been reading this board passively for a while now and find the
subject absolutely fascinating especially from the point of view of
a civil rights nut like myself  My problem is that I'm new to the field
and paragraphs like the above keep popping up  I'm sure what Mr 
Bellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important but I have 
NO IDEA what it means     
  
  Anyway I'm keen to learn and will read anything I can get my hands on
that explains this stuff in lay terms I have a decent CS background but
not a huge amount of hyperadvanced math  Can anyone point me to a FAQ
or a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and
maybe a little history as well  I read the piece in this month's WIRED can
anyone tell me how much I should trust the references they suggest

  Ah but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the government's domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping


Unlike the CIA the NSA has no prohibition against domestic spying  Read
Bamford's THE PUZZLE PALACE

I did  You're mistaken  NSA's communications intelligence mission is
strictly against foreign governments  Here's an excerpt from the enabling
charter  Oct  Truman that should clarify this  The charter was
declassified in about Feb  when an FOIA request made it public  Mind
you I don't know that they never collect anything they're not supposed
to but spying on US citizens isn't in their charter

    b The COMINT  mission of the National  Security Agency
	NSA shall be to provide an effective  unified organization
	and control of the communications  intelligence activities of
	the United States  conducted against foreign  governments to
	provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures
	pertaining thereto   As  used in  this directive  the terms
	communications intelligence  or COMINT shall be construed
	to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception
	of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda
	broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such
	communications by other  than intended recipients  but shall
	exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of
	finished intelligence

They're also tasked with protecting the US's communications but I haven't
seen the specific enabling memo on that  I assume that's the role under
which Skipjack was developed

NSA is not in the standardsetting business though  that's why this
Clipper stuff came from NIST which I believe is tasked with coming up
with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies
which would include NSA

	I don't think that this should be worked on just in the context
of cryptography That's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts
of people

	What's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone
quality speechRS converter Imagine if you will a little box that
takes data on its serial port and puts out sound and takes sound and codes
it to signals on its serial port Full duplex Now this device is not a
cryptographic device It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever
you want to call it It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications
for
	a speech synthesis with a few nifty libraries and some samples
	b speech recording for electronic messaging
	c building voicemail systems
	d internet talk radio
	e internet relay chat

	Of course some of the electronic messaging in item b might be
encrypted possibly realtime but that's the user's decision One would
need  of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout
to switch over and some code on say a  laptop

	I'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
internet talk radio could be done Ideally though it should be a general
purpose device It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody
should be able to balk at its widespread use Obviously to make it easy
for homebrewers it should use pretty common hardware

	It's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a couple
of folks about building such a thing before this whole clipper thing
started I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are
able to make sample units given incentive and some time I'd envisioned
finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund
development of a public domain board layout and parts set that could
be published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD
packages and in PostScript

	Anyone interested I'll start a provisional mailing list Let
me know if you want on

Argh This is what I get for acknowledging David Sternlight's existence

 Though I think this an overstatement it does contain a grain of truth It's
 drug dealers spies terrorists and organized crime figures assuming
 enough probable cause to convince a judge who need to be watched not
 lawabiding citizens

Okay it looks like I am going to have to do the history lesson after all

During the Vietnam war there were a great many citizens opposed to it
who considered themselves perfectly law abiding although Mr Nixon and
his lackeys thought otherwise

The Federal government had no compunction about adding people who
are otherwise decent law abiding and upstanding but disagree with
us to your nice little list Do you think this could never happen
again

Note that I am not speculating about what the government could do
but discussing the sort of observation  including but not limited
to phone tapping  that the government put its citizens under during
a time of national tension

Your naivete is still appalling BTW I mean read what you posted again
How are we to differentiate between Good People and Bad People Answer
A priori we can't we have to assume Now which way do we assume Do
we assume a priori that a citizen is lawabiding or rather a potential

In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts I've tossing back and
forth  
   deleted  
A circut court judge in Illinois once said When dealing with a government
that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry
one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means
to parry this attack on personal privacy

Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar
detectors

The point remains  More and more I see the government slowly washing
away privacy  Even unwittingly  Do you think I will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth  Do you think I
will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what I'm saying  Even if there is no evidence of my
guilt  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind  I'm tired
of it  There is IMHO no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy

More than the proposals themselves I read the language of the press
releases the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public and I am sickened  I am revolted  I am repulsed

 perhaps even  of this country could care less about the
clipper chip the wiretap bill the smart card because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration

The problem is the people are not having the scope or implicataions
pointed out to them  Hell most haven't even heard of Clipper and
when they do it will be in soothing language telling everyone how
nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy

How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper
decision  The provisions of the Crime Bill  The abuses of Civil Forfeiture
The government uses polls to support  percent of the people want
gun bans etc yet the same pollsters have determined according to
the media that  percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust
is

The people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are
denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of
rights are going on quietly  When they find out when it hits them
it will be too late  One cannot expect each citizen to spend all their
time probing searching researching etc   For example how big a
percentage of the average population even has access to USENET  Way
less than  percent I bet   How many outside of InternetUSENET
are even AWARE of what Big Brother is doing or have been exposed to
arguments of both sides of the issue

What the public will get is only ONE side  The Government's side

THAT is scary


This saddens and frightens me

I am a conserveative believe it or not  A law and order conserveative
But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me
mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the American people  Tell them it's going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists and they will let you
put cameras in their home

How can the bulk of the people be informed when the media refuses to
do it

Even in the wake of Waco you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves

Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack  It is not meant to be used in
agression  This is the difference between selfdefence and murder

To be quite honest the way things are going I'd call it self defense

Let's try to avoid killing things eh  There's enough blood shed in the
world without adding a couple of riots Civil Wars etc

I'm probably overreacting  But what I've read scared me a lot  I don't
want my children growing up in a War Zone


And I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera
 hours a day

The people at large need to be informed  BUT HOW   I am but one person
I try to talk to everyone that will listen but I can hardly make any
kind of dent

Ouch  Thanks for trying it

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months
ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform
realtime fullduplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates
sustainable by today's modems

This test program reads linearlyencoded audio from the audio device
compresses it with GSM  compresses frames of  bit samples
recorded at kHz into  bits resulting in a  Hz frame rate encrypts
it with DES then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio
back to the audio device  The compressed encrypted audio stream
is  kbitss 

My Sparcstation IPC not exactly a very fast machine these days
certainly slower than an ELC would just barely sustain this activity
audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible  I
ran it as a realtime process to get the best results  Remember
though that this program is a quick hack and the performance can
certainly be improved

The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tubcstuberlinde
I believe look for gsm or toast  I used Eric Young's DES
implementation but I no longer know where I got it from

How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper
decision 

How can the bulk of the people be informed when the media refuses to
do it

The answer to your second question lies in the way you phrased the
first one  'the media is'

The medis isn't 'is'  The media 'are'  'Media' means 'more than one
medium'  There are thousands of publications  Some say this some say
that  

     How can the bulk of the people be informed when they won't read
     informative publications

I received a fax of a letter from Representative Markey Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Finance to Ron Brown Secretary of Commerce  Since 
encryption and the Clipper chip are raised in this letter I felt it would be
of interest  I understand that on  April Mr Markey will be holding a
hearing on the questions raised in this letter  There may also be a followon
hearing dedicated to the clipper chip but that's not definite

I've typed in the letter which follows  Any errors in transcription are 
mine

 letter of interest follows 

April  

The Honorable Ronald H Brown
Secretary
Department of Commerce
th and Pennsylvania Ave NW
Washington DC 

Dear Secretary Brown

   As you know I have long been interested in the privacy 
and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in 
a networked environment  Recent reports concerning the 
Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption 
standard based upon clipper chip technology have raised a 
number of related issues  The international competitiveness 
of US high tech manufacturers and the software industry is 
a key factor that the government should consider when 
addressing issues of encryption and data security  As the 
nation moves forward in developing the national 
communications and information infrastructure security of 
telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an 
increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of 
users

   The hacker community can compromise the integrity of 
telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the 
network  The people and businesses that use the nation's 
telecommunications network and the personal computers linked 
through it increasingly are demanding that information be 
protected against unauthorized access alteration and theft

   I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean 
that to remain competitive internationally US companies 
would be compelled to develop two products  one for US 
government customers and another for private commercial 
users who may want a higher encryption standard  This may 
inadvertently increase costs to those US companies hoping 
to serve both markets  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis 
of this issue please respond to the following questions

 Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the 
Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA NIST 
or the vendor  If so please identify such entities and the 
nature of testing performed  If not please describe any 
plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how 
such experts will be chosen

 Under the Administration's plan what entities will be the 
holders of the keys to decrypt scrambled data  What 
procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to 
designate such key holders

 Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the 
Administration contain a trap door or back door which 
could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to 
crack the code

 It is clear that over time changes in technologies used 
for communications will require new techniques and additional 
equipment  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid 
advancement of telecommunications technology

 What additional costs would the proposed encryption place 
on the Federal government  What is the estimated cost to 
consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard 
in their equipment

 What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the 
competitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the 
clipper chip technology on US exports of computer and 
telecommunications hardware and software products

   I would appreciate your response by no later than close
ofbusiness Wednesday April    If you have any 
questions please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or 
Karen Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at  

Sincerely

Edward J Markey
Chairman

I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper
level routines into a single data link The upper levels won't know
about this and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once at
the initial link establishment I figure that I can do this with
DES and a DiffieHellman key exchange

Is using a DiffieHellman exchange to establish a  bit DES key
acceptable in other words what are the pro's and con's of such a 
setup Are there any important issues to watch out for aside from
filtering out unacceptable keys

And in order to achieve this I guess I will need to use bit math
routines for probable prime number calculation exponentiation etc
so could someone point me towards a good package this is strictly
noncommercial

Thanks for posting that  I was surprised to notice however that one
question I might have expected to be asked was not  Are all forms of
strong encryption other than the Clipper to be made illegal  Speaking
of which is anyone aware of whether that question has been asked of
any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government  I have
not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been
reported but I could have easily missed it

   Well actually this one's easy It's their job The NSA is
 supposed to develop cryptosystems If the government chooses to go
 ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses so be it

  Ah but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the government's domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping


    The NSA's charter forbids them from doing any purely domestic
intelligence work I would think that even providing assistance in
development of the Skipjack algorithom is a violation of that charter 
But as with any intrenched government agency they will do what they
think is expedent

   I did  You're mistaken  NSA's communications intelligence mission is

   declassified in about Feb  when an FOIA request made it public
Interesting  Where can I get the whole thing

   NSA is not in the standardsetting business though  that's why this
   Clipper stuff came from NIST which I believe is tasked with coming up
   with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies
   which would include NSA

Several of the newspaper reports have made it fairly clear that the
NSA did all the real work  You can't believe everything you read in
the papers  but the package of information the NIST is faxing out
has so little information beyond what's widely known that it sounds
like it's true

The problem is the people are not having the scope or implicataions
pointed out to them  Hell most haven't even heard of Clipper and
when they do it will be in soothing language telling everyone how
nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy

much more deleted

The people at large need to be informed  BUT HOW   I am but one person
I try to talk to everyone that will listen but I can hardly make any
kind of dent

Here is how Lets write a DOCUMENT which includes all the reasons
we oppose Clipper in clear concise nontechincal manner I urge 
everyone of you to take the very simple start below and repost it
with changes Let the text evolve until we reach something most of us
like Then all of you should send a copy with a personnel letter
to your congress critter local reporter on scitech etc

Please to make this a success try to post only an agreed version
not flames To respond to a flame to this please change the subject

all of these are points  which should be made into paragraphs

What is wrong with the clipper chip  By usenet users


 It is secret 
 How can we trust the escrow agencies
 It is not costeffective
 We want other encryption systems the government seems to want to
   disallow it in the future
 Anyone can build a nonkey system
 We are worried about a back door
 Once everyone uses a clipper chip the mechanism for a BigBrother
   government is in place a change of government can lead to it 
   Especially since the escrow agencies operation is not governed by
   law so the president can change the rules to allow free access to
   the keys at any time eg during war
 Few criminals are caught by wiretaps the cost and risks are unjustified
 Once the FBI get hold of a key it can decrypt past and future conversations

I haven't been able to open an ftp session with that machine

Operating under the assumption that the address was wrong I tried using

That's all I could find about the ncsl domainoh and I tried an MX lookup
on the machine in question which failed  Nicnamewhois domain lookups at
both registries failed too 

So I thought hey I'm just not using the tools right and tried calling
the BBS number  no answer

I'm probably doing something wrongor perhaps the machine has been put
behind a firewall  But it does look like csrcncslnistgov has become an
unmachine  If someone would try ftp'ing to it or knows what's up I'd
really appreciate the info

It's not Clipper it's any encryption system  I've seen a number of

        A 'multiline cleartext bridge
                      
        And just were would you put that bridge  If it isn't at one of

 I've got a better idea  We give one set to the KGB co Washington embassy

IMHO one should place the keybanks into satellites space The

 Another idea Use a laptop computer  As mentioned earlier the LCD screen
 is a lot less noisy than a standard CRT but since many laptops have power
 supplies that run at  volts instead of  they would be considerably 
 quieter

I'm afraid this doesn't work either We can pick up laptop screens without any
problem

Most of the socalled low radiation' monitors are also useless The description
turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one

We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military Tempest kit but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers We built a prototype it works
and it's still sitting on my lab bench Commercial interest was exactly zero

In the absence of open standards a monitor which really is low radiation'
and costs  dollars more can't compete against a monitor which just
claims to be low radiation' and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box

 The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low

And how many illegal wiretaps are performed  Funny but I'll be that

     The NSA's charter forbids them from doing any purely domestic
 intelligence work I would think that even providing assistance in
 development of the Skipjack algorithom is a violation of that charter 
 But as with any intrenched government agency they will do what they
 think is expedent

There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject  For
example the National Computer Security Act of  specifically directs
NBS sic to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian
Federal computers  Pick up the bill from cpsrorg it also includes
a report describing it and some of the legislative history including
concerns about NSA's involvement  Note also that NSA is specifically
charged with running the National Computer Security Center   to
quote the aforementioned report  NSA also will work with industries at
the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private
sector use''

It may or may not be a good idea to have NSA tinkering with this but
I'm pretty sure it's legal  Btw  when it comes to development of
cryptosystems there may be two choices  Either NSA helped develop it
in which case maybe they can crack it maybe not but probably no one
else can or NSA didn't help in which case they probably can crack it
and maybe others as well

 Does anyone know of companies that are currently manufacturing

 can  Some pointers would be greatly appreciated

Motorola certainly makes them but I don't know how you

You could also bring in encryption chips from outside the country

It depends on the mode you're using  For a single bit input block a
onebit error will have a  percent chance of corrupting each of the 
output bits  in other words it essentially turns the output block into
a random number  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode however only the
one bit block will be affected  The next block and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly

It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely

   OK I should have read the thread before posting my own   I would
   just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat the
   fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases  nor shall any person 
     be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself

    Maybe you are using the wrong amendment  If someone were to seize
a safe containing your paper records and demand that you produce
the combination the applicable defense would be on grounds of
unreasonable search and seizure  The police would be entitled to
subpoena documents relating to a specific matter but any broad search
such as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional
In the case of the safe they would probably get a locksmith and
assert that they ONLY examined documents covered by the warrent
Sure  In the cryptographic case their only resort would be
rubberhose cryptography

    This would also make a good mental experiment to use in
choosing escrow agents  Would you trust this proposed agent with a
key to your hard diskor half the key for that matter

  Second question Why Why is such a strange procedure used and
 not a real RNG  This turns those SS in a kind of bottleneck for
 system security

	 The only theory that makes any sense is that S and S are
	 either the same for all chips or vary among very few
	 possibilities so that anyone trying to break the encryption
	 by brute force need only plow through the possible serial
	 numbers  about one billion multiplied by the number
	 of different S S combinations


Suppose instead that S and S can be reconstructed given  or  of the
unit keys generated in a single batch through some sort of known
plaintext attack say  Suppose further that  or  of the chips
programmed in each session never find their way into commercial
products but instead end up elsewhere

Suppose the folks at elsewhere can determine a unit key given
physical access to one of these chips  Then those same folks can
determine S and S for the whole batch

Too many suppositions  Yeah probably

     Just curious how would the Clipper Chip system handle
     conference calls
 
 Depending on the encryption system so long as everyone has the same
 key it can be done  For example I was using vat which is an
 Internet Audio tool for a conference call and we were encrypting the
 session  Unfortunately one site was doing more work and didn't
 have the CPU for it so it didn't sound all that good at a different
 site

You would have to use something other than the ATT black box  in other
words I don't think public key would work  The session key would have 
to be agreed upon prior to the conversation and distributed to all 
sites beforehand

Or go out and get a STUIII

 of interest  I understand that on  April Mr Markey will be holding
a
 hearing on the questions raised in this letter  There may also be a
followon
 hearing dedicated to the clipper chip but that's not definite

Glenn

Thanks for posting that  I was surprised to notice however that one
question I might have expected to be asked was not  Are all forms of
strong encryption other than the Clipper to be made illegal  Speaking
of which is anyone aware of whether that question has been asked of
any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government  I have
not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been
reported but I could have easily missed it

Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality
of other strong cryptosystems   So far any references I have seen
have been weaselwords more plans in the future etc but nothing
that could be taken as a NO strong crypto will NOT be outlawed  I
have heard not verified that the Crime Bill before Congress has
language that either requires escrow of keys or that will regard
all systems 'unapproved' for public use like strong cryptosystems
not trivially broken by the Govt or without escrowed keys
which one cannot readily change read use being only permitted by
folks with 'special' connections or government agencies as either
'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY
but by added Civil Forfeiture powers and clever wording EFFECTIVELY
outlawed for all intents and purposes

Now for some idle speculation  for those who don't care hit 'n' now

Crypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY
outlawing ANY class of crypto systems  For example a crowbar hammers
screwdrivers and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much
at the whim of the authorities based primarily on the individual
possessing them in the car etc not being in a trade that makes routine
use of these tools  In a like manner one who has no 'legitimate need'
gov't definition for strong crypto software or systems and is caught
using them might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'
In other words if one is not working for a corporation with extremely
sensitive commercial data that warrants in the Fed's opinion strong
security or a government agency and securing only workrelated data
not personal data one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd
A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as
a 'legitimate NEED' 
Why do you want such strong security especially from 'legitimate law
enforcement' An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so
concerned  government is not in the business of revealing your personal
secrets to the public so you must be trying to conceal or planning
to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO HIDE HMMMM
I expect that initially there will be some people selected either at
random or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of
'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about
this mega ''s

One asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that
there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH an
argument used in the abortion debate  You do NOT have a right to have
security that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break' as suggested
in the Clipper Press Release

This in a nutshell is what I find so extremely frightening  Not only
for crypto systems as in this case but for the precident it will set
laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy escrow of both
safedeposit box keys  'master' keys or combinations for privately
owned safes and so on  WHY NOT

I cannot think of a better way to make an 'endrun' around those
'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution  A law cannot be easily
declared unconstitutional if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW  It would
simply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies A
simple policy decision just like so many of the gun regulations are
mainly BATF policy decisions  The Conversation of the Fed agents
would go something like

We are gonna seize your home your computers your car your bank
account you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes unless you
have a floppy in yer pocket because they are all connected with your
acquisition transport and use of 'terrorist tools' andor 'drug dealers
tools'  part of the WoD or against terrorism ya unnerstand no
decent American Subject would be against these noble causes

Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrongdoing  we are only saying
your HOME COMPUTERS CAR BANK ASSETS are connected with wrongdoing
SOMEHOW  they housed transported and funded these 'terrorist tools'
Only a civil matter   hehheh  We had this 'tip'grin

Therefore the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT
apply  we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY not YOUevil grin

If you wish to deposit a BOND hire some attorneys and go to court to
PROVE the innocence of this property that they are not 'terrorist tools'
and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools' go ahead
we have no problem with that  'Course with your bank assets seized
no car computer or home probably no job too and your
lessthanlimitless resources you might run into some minor practical
difficulties grin

THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic  It is EXACTLY how
the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been
used to store DRUGS  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on
the property only some bozo who will say 'yup  I stored stuff in
that dude's house' probably to get out of a  year sentence for
dealing  Much more cost effective to let him walk to bust another
day and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets

Ob Disclaimer of course

Ok note that I am not a lawyer and can only base these speculations
on what I have readheardbeen told regarding past Civil Forfeiture
cases and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies
or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone or who
do not wish to be put in a risky situation especially in areas where
they are denied either meaningful police protection AND the means to be
able to even pretend to defend themselves as is quite common back East
like NJ MA NYC Wa DC or out West in CA  These people have the
choice of cowering under the government boot or cowering under threats
of pissed off drug dealing gangbangers helpless in either case
All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain or behind
the Feds wanting to 'make an example'  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'

Point is are these speculations way out of line or are they all too
typical and if so does the extension to crypto and just about anything
that the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable  And if not
why not what are our guarantees besides the government promises

NONE

sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care about

It is still easy to conceal superencryption at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the K key which can take a while
presumably not in nearrealtime  Worstcase in which the escrow agencies
provide the U key to the local cops still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant unless the same key is used for both directions
which I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist on

    conference calls
   It's not Clipper it's any encryption system  I've seen a number of
   designs they generally involve a multiline cleartext bridge

	   A 'multiline cleartext bridge
			 
	   And just were would you put that bridge  If it isn't at one of
   the receiptants location forget encryption at all  You have blown any
   security you thought you might have had 

Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are
military or equivalent like CIA and other embassy personnel
so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal 
it's in a vault on a military base or Ft Meade and the
secure phones are in soundproof rooms with big locks on the doors
because they're talking about Classified Stuff or Golf with Other Generals

That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our
offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans
and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info
and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob
most people don't use soundproof vaults and may use bridges in their
PBX or from the local phone company way calls or Long Distance
or valueadded phone company eg Alliance conference bridges

If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones
the conferencing aspects don't change  But there may be a market niche for
trusted conferencebridge providers though I suppose the inquisitors
would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges
just in case a Bad Guy might use the service

I'm afraid this doesn't work either We can pick up laptop screens without any
problem

Most of the socalled low radiation' monitors are also useless The description
turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one

We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military Tempest kit but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers We built a prototype it works
and it's still sitting on my lab bench Commercial interest was exactly zero

In the absence of open standards a monitor which really is low radiation'
and costs  dollars more can't compete against a monitor which just
claims to be low radiation' and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box

Ross

I heard somewhere can't name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pickup just CRTs but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip  If
that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be pickedup from the video controller  Can anybody verify
or refute this

Sorry my news reader doesn't seem to know how to copy a subject header
This tracks the thread why people don't need strong crypto

The Atomic Energy Act of  expressly forbids thinking about building
nuclear devices  While I was in grad school a friend of mine got a 
security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine
He found lots of articles which were public domain removed from the
local engineering library Madison Wisconsin  So the lawyers sent him
all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in
the article was already public  What pissed everyone off was a local
underground paper went and published the article anyway it had been
precensored by the feds that's what this was all about so the judge
declared the case moot

The Atomic Energy Act of  has never been tested in court  From my
discussions with several people familiar with the case only  other
times has this preemptive clause been used  In every case the people
simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out

For all intents and purposes the government does have precidence for
declaring things classified after it has been published  While I was
working on Star Wars this happened to me my clearance was in the works
and I developed a method for tracking particle beams  It was good enough
to classify so I was no longer allowed to work on it  A friend from
Canada was in the same boat he developed a method to compute stripping
cross sections but because the subject was classified he was not allowed
to present his own paper at a conference  He later published it in an
open journal without problems

When the going gets wierd the wierd turn pro  The feds can do whatever
they want whenever they feel like it and they will make up rules to let
themselves get away with it  Since the mass media can't tell the difference
between a joke and the real thing like ranch appocolypse for the Waco
massacre don't count on them to help spread the word about their loss
of freedom  The government can make strong crypto illegal  SO WHAT
Since the government does not obey any of its own rules why should we

 There are three issues with Clipper  The first is whether or not the
 architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working  My answer
 with one significant exception is yes  I really do think that NSA and
 NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that
 their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping under
 certain carefullycontrolled circumstances with a minimum risk of
 abuse  The exception is that U exists outside of the chip on a
 programming diskette  That's seriously wrong  U and U should be
 loaded onto the chip separately  To those who disagree and I don't
 claim my answer is obvious though I found my own reasoning
 sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions
 section of my technical analysis paper  I had originally blasted the
 scheme I issue this invitation  assume that you were charged with
 implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and
 due process  What would you do differently  In answering this
 question please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions  that both
 strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap
 some domestic users is necessary  If you feel it necessary to
 challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue I
 present below  Right here I'm discussing just the technical
 aspects  And no I don't by any means claim that just because
 something can be done it should be

OK Steve here's a sketch of an alternative that I believe addresses
most of the objections to the Clipper scheme

Notation
		concatenation
		exclusive or
	EMK	message M encrypted by key K
	DMK	message M decrypted by key K
	HM	hash digestsignature of message M

Important Values
	UX		local chip unit key from escrow agency X
	UX		remote chip unit key from escrow agency X
	N		serial number of the local chip
	N		serial number of the remote chip
	A		number of escrow agencies
	KK	session keys agreed upon external to this protocol
	F		family key need not be secret

Protocol
	Choose KKA such that K  KKA
	Remote chip does same for KKKA

	Compute the following

		L  EK U
		
		LA  EKA UA

		L  N  EN  L    LA F

		Remote chip does the same for LLAL

	Send L to remote chip and receive L from remote chip

	Compute

		KE  HK  N  L    LA
			 K  DL F

		KD  HK  DL F
			 K  N  L    LA

		Note that DL F  N  L    LA

		Remote chip does the same for KE and KD

	User data is encrypted decrypted with keys KE KE
		KD KD

Assumptions
	No trap doors in E D and H H is not invertible

	Algorithms for E D and H are secret Otherwise a software
	implementation bogus chip could communicate with a real chip

	The chip only supports the following operation

		  Return N
		  Load Kx
		  Return EKx Ux
		  Return EN  L    LA F
		  Given EN  L    LA F
			return NLLA
		  Load K
		  Given EN  L    LA F
			compute KE KD
		  Given M return EM KE
		  Given M return DM KD

	Anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying
	the chip UUAFN

	UUA can not be determined except by destroying the chip
	Unfortunately this may not be true in reality I suppose it's
	possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a
	sophisticatedsp xray machine to look for blown fuses

	The U's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies

Notes
	For tapping escrow agency Y is given N EKY UY N
	EKY UY and returns KY KY

	LEA's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from
	both chips and the encrypted partial keys This allows the agencies
	to record that both chips were tapped

	LEA's only get the session key not the key to all conversations
	of a particular chip This precludes realtime decrypting of a
	conversation but that isn't one of the STATED requirements

Observation
	In order for any secure by tapable communication scheme to work
	the active parts need to share a secret And if this secret is
	revealed communications by those that know the secret can be made
	untapable Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm
	and the master family key Relative size and complexity suggests
	that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the
	scheme a LOT easier and faster than the algorithm

A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as

Why do you want such strong security especially from 'legitimate law
enforcement' An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so
concerned  government is not in the business of revealing your personal
secrets to the public so you must be trying to conceal or planning
to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO HIDE HMMMM
	You have underlined here the battle that must be fought  It is
	a battle for the hearts and minds of the american public
	People must realize that the government is not their a fit
	father confessor  The government does not have a right to
	share our every thought the moment we decide to share that
	thought with someone else at a distance  In order to protect
	ourselves from a government bent on undermining the constitution
	we must realize that our government is our enemy as much if not
	more than the Soviet Union ever was  This is hard for 
	some people who have been brought up with loyalty to our government
	cast as being synonmous with patriotism  

I expect that initially there will be some people selected either at

'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about
this mega ''s
	We must be vigilant and make sure that we do not let such
	events go by unprotested  We must be willing to fight the

THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic  It is EXACTLY how
the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been
used to store DRUGS  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on
the property only some bozo who will say 'yup  I stored stuff in
that dude's house' probably to get out of a  year sentence for
dealing  Much more cost effective to let him walk to bust another

Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of superencryption  An automated fullsystem surveillance
mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key F
can validate Clipper wrappers and NESN associations but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of superencryption unless it knows all unit keys
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces upon specific wiretaplike order

The serial number will be in a  bit block with a  bit filler  Doesn't
take a lot to check to see if that is correct

Yes but the extra encryption could be applied before the message
is encrypted by the Clipper so that the wrapper would be fine the
phone's serial number and the session key would be in the lawenforcement
field etc but the message wouldn't be readable even if the particular
Clipper's key were obtained from the escrow agents  In fact it shouldn't
even be possible to detect that a message has been doubleencrypted without
a court order right

I was under the impression from reading Denning's description of the
Clipper's operation that the same session key is used in both directions for
encrypting the message text but that each chip uses it's own key for
encrypting the session key into the lawenforcement field  So you only
need to know the U key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
messages in both directions

A person I know belonging to a research lab of a rivate
company claimed to me during a priavte conversation that given the
equipment in his lab he could crack a Kerberos ticket in  minutes to
an hour He had access to rather powerful DES hardware but not of an
extraordinare kind I believe The attack was possible because of the
amount of known plaintext in the ticket which itself constitutes a small
message This was two years ago

I don't believe you and I don't believe your friend

Why 

Because DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily
availble Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret
he was bullshitting you

Now it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the implementation of
the Kerberos protocol For instance using a weak RNG to generate keys
might cut down on the keyspace not for the user keys  for the other
kind who's name I can't remember However this is not what was
claimed You are claiming a general weakness in DES which is not
known to exist in the open literature

Don't get me wrong  DES is weaker than it should be However
cracking it in  minutes requires more money be spent on the cracking
machine than ANY organization I know of has available

	This is a real address My understanding of the current process
that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed
by retiree volunteers who match the message against message profiles
and check the message count Ie yeah that's a for gays in the
military what's this clipper stuff must be against gays in the
military

	The highervolume whitehouse email stuff is in the works
I know for a fact but won't be online for probably another month
or two at the soonest My understanding is that the link speed will
increase direct internet instead of Compuerve to floppy but the
message processing will remain the same

Unless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail
every day you may have better luck printing out a letter on paper
that flat white stuff all over my desk and SnailMailing it to the
White House I imagine writing to your local representative and
senator wouldn't hurt either Heck why not write to Al Gore while
you're at it

	The white house email does get read I agree that printing it
and sending Cc to everyone you can think of is probably better because
it is more visible but the message processing fitting messages against
a template is the same in either case

      I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act
   on the export of cryptographic technology however is it illegal to
   transmit encrypted data from the US to another country  If so
   then which laws apply to this situation

From the US law perspective unless you're engaging in illegal speech
it's not illegal to use encryption  Yet  The NSA is allowed to try
to listen but you're not obligated to make it easy for them  Yet
The other country may have more repressive laws about that
I gather France's bureaucracy wants to know what you're saying 
and in the old Soviet Union they didn't need laws to make things illegal 

paranoia follows for those of you who want to play it safe 
The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate RSA's patents eg if you use PGP the
NSA may tell RSA that you're doing so and if the Secret Service catches on
they may decide that the mere fact that RSA hasn't filed a lawsuit
against you doesn't mean that you don't deserve to have your computer
confiscated for possible patent violation munitions law violation
espionage money laundering drug importation and creatin' a disturbance
and then not give it back because you did violate the patent even
though they had to drop all the other charges unlike that nasty Steve
Jackson who had the gall not to be guilty of anything

Yes that's true  TEMPEST is nothing magic it's just listening to any
available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  
you know to separate out the interesting stuff 

The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of
signal so they're easy to detect and if you do your sync carefully
you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptivelymarked
Chevy StepVan  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse
In both cases it's especially nice because it gets you the data the
user is looking at rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is
paging out to disk etc

With newer quieter equipment there isn't as much signal and it's harder to
isolate the fun parts  TEMPESTrated equipment has much lower signal levels
But Everything has vibrations as Master Chuan said

I'm afraid this doesn't work either We can pick up laptop screens without any
problem

Most of the socalled low radiation' monitors are also useless The description
turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one

We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military Tempest kit but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers We built a prototype it works
and it's still sitting on my lab bench Commercial interest was exactly zero

In the absence of open standards a monitor which really is low radiation'
and costs  dollars more can't compete against a monitor which just
claims to be low radiation' and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box

Just thought of something  Yes laptops can still be read but it's not quite
as easy as a normal pc with a CRT  My thought Airline pilots lately have
been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's
instruments  If this can be hyped up manufacturers may start building
laptops with even lower emmisions  It would probably still be possible to
pick up with surveillance equipment but at this point it would be a lot
cheaper to mask the remaining signals with TEMPEST techniques

   You should probably use numbers much larger than bits  Also you
may want to include some randomlygenerated bitstrings in your protocol
This way if someone should find the shared key you and another person
use on one day they won't be able to guess it for the next day
 
   Ie A sends GA mod P and random string R
      B sends GB mod P and random string R
 
      Both find GA mod P B mod P  Shared Key then both calculate
 
      Session Key  HashRShared Key R
 
   Also you will want to make sure that you're getting the right public
key value GA mod P  Someone with the power to intercept and change messages
can oterwise spoof you by sending both of you his public key and then
acquiring a session key with each of you

        It seems to me that the Step  of taking a warrant to the
        telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring don't
        you love animal metaphors

        With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip
        ENF is not syntactically different than N all they
        have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of
        today's target and use the serial number to identify the
        session they want and get the chip number of the other end of
        the conversation Even without the key this is great for
        traffic analysis I can think of several ways to learn the
        right serial number

        It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to
        eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to
        cooperate or risking getting caught in the act with your
        alligator clips erect This is particularly handy if you have
        S and S

        BTW did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial
        number
        
        Cheers

 GUESS WHAT PEOPLE  You live in one of the few countries in the world
 where a person can complain without getting shot at  

        Only guessing but from his address I'd say that Jerry like
        me lives in Canada Unlike me he thinks that our friends in
        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do and he has not seen
        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us

        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and
        ineffective law enforcement Our rednecks tend to be the
        objects of derision rather than elected officials It's
        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals Any
        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't
        like his or her attitude it's national news It also often
        blows up in their faces eg the wellintentioned but flawed
        Zundel case which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme
        Court not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to
        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under

        Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of
        it Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we
        have agencies and some of them have teeth They also have the
        War on Drugs which gives lawenforcement agencies exceptional
        powers to ignore individuals' rights the DEA has more
        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the
        War Measures Act We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop
        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective
        suppression of private citizens' rights Not only that our
        Police Commissions have teeth as I learned when I had to fend
        off a bent cop

        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life Liberty and
        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting governmentimposed order
        while the nation founded on Peace Order and Good Government
        is getting inyourface liberty

        That's not to say our time won't come It looks like Chretien
        is going to run on a lawandorder platform Be afraid

   Well actually this one's easy It's their job The NSA is
 supposed to develop cryptosystems If the government chooses to go
 ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses so be it

  Ah but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the government's domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping


But the NSA will not be doing any wiretapping  The actual wiretapping will
presumably be conducted by the FBI  Of course the capability for this was
provided by the NSA but I think that they are still within the limitations
of their charter

I realize this is a fine point and some may differ but this is my opinion
Although I don't care for Clipper and won't support or use it I don't see
the NSA as having overstepped their bounds

Hmmm CELP takes up about  MIPS for full duplex and has been
implemented on about a million DSP chips the  card in my PC only cost
about  and I'm sure once demand goes up the prices would drop The Analog
Devices  board that we're looking at now cost about  academic price
I don't think hardware is something to worry about if you get it working
people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow
What we need here is a good implementation of CELP the government code is
absolute crap I got a  speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours
and modifications to pgp to allow it to compressdecompress  bit frames
every msec I think the AD should have enough juice for this MIPS
As part of the project I'm working on now we're trying to get CELP up and
running in realtime full duplex mode I gotta find the source to pgp and
see how tough it would be to integrate the endecryption parts into the code
I'll play with it Anyone else out there got an AD setup

I heard somewhere can't name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily

that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything

As anyone who attended HoHoCon will attest you can pick information

  In order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography
policies are acceptable we must set forth a list of basic requirements
I would propose the following as a starting point

   The algorithm must be publicly known and must have a record of
       surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses

   The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the
       advertised algorithm is in fact the one that is being used

   The key must be quickly changeable by the user and must be of a
       sufficient length and complexity to defeat any bruteforce search
       possible now or in the reasonably near future

  Note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key
escrow system the May  issue of Byte describes an example of an
encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent
with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be
escrowed in order to have one's public key listed by a central distributor

The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use

NSA may tell RSA that you're doing so and if the Secret Service catches on

I'm afraid I have to disagree with you on that point  NSA will not
tell RSA or any other nonDOD entity anything that its eavesdropping
reveals  That includes the FBI and Secrect Service although there

We had a senior NSA scientist in Cambridge at one of our workshops recently
in fact he was here when the Clipper announcement was made but we didn't
learn of it till after he'd gone He said on this point that he was forbidden
by law to monitor conversations between US nationals and he is a chap who is 
very precise about his choice of words So I don't expect he'd have any qualms
about monitoring a domestic US conversation if one of the parties was an alien

However it got me thinking of the Navajo code talkers Just imagine

 Hello is that the Iraqi mission in New York This is the Iraqi foreign
 ministry in Baghdad I am Farouq Hussein US citizen social security number
 soandso'

 Yes indeed this is the New York mission Mustafa Jadid speaking also a
 US citizen my social security number is suchandsuch here is our report
 on activities against the Satan Clinton'

        This one is easy they 'tape' the conversation call the FBI or

construed as a threat against the President of the United States  I am
sure theyNSAFBISS have enough judges in their collective

 Hmmm
 
 Peter G White President Synthesis  Inc

 PeterWhitemixcomcom

This is rather simple actually 

Having just been through a revolution our founding fathers  well
understood  the  relationship between We the People and a govern
ment of by and for the people They  also  understood  that  any
government  of  the People can sometimes grow to become a govern
ment not by the People or not for the  People  This  is  how
they chose to handle all of the possibilities

   nd Amendment
   A wellregulated militia being necessary to the security of a
   free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
   not be infringed

This is the ONLY part of the  Constitution  which  gives  us  the
right  of  revolution  if  things  seem to be going cockeyed All
that's really necessary is an organized march on Washington just
have everyone bring their arms Obviously the nd is an important
right a right which many Americans do not fully appreciate

Hope this helps

You would be arrested as an international arms trafficker

There are several things in ITAR which have never been tested in court 
The concensus appears to be

You could be arrested as an international arms trafficker  You could
regardless of the state of the law but there are some paragraphs which
suggest you would be violating the law

If it goes to court the ITARs could be thrown out is incompatible with the
First amendment or the court could rule that software is technical
data not subject to the ITARs or the court could rule that the
phrase publicly available as defined in the ITARs would apply
making it only subject to requiring a general export license or you could
be prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage  General
concensus among lawyers who have read the ITARs is that one of the first

 Recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect's phone
 calls They do what they do nowfigure out which lines to tap They then
 record the stuff If it's Clipper they read the law enforcement block
 extract the serial number and get the keys using the court order
 
 No new difficulties such as using someone else's phone instrument or phone
 line are introduced that wouldn't have existed absent clipper If the
 crooks were going to use a pay phone say they could have done so without
 clipper If the government figures out they're so doing they listen in and
 if it's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys
 
 If the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped line
 there's no problem The Feds don't care whose phone instrument is used just
 that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line They get the
 serial number get the keys and they are in business

Summary You can't fool it

In article WCSAprrainierATTCOM wcsanchorhoattcom Bill Stewart  writes

   The serial number will be in a  bit block with a  bit filler  Doesn't
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct

Depends on whether the filler is a constant makes checking easy
but susceptible to replay or variable eg timer counter random
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if they've missed messages or gotten them out of
sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care about

I'd use a secret nope obscure cryptographic encoding to expand the 
 bit serial number to a  bit block The redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy 
replaced the LE block by random data 

And of course the LE block would be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct LE block must 
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back 

For those of you who might want to mangle the LE block eg by xoring 
a constant pattern on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies 
of this block perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so at regular intervals during the transmission If the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext you know  it's just like a checksum for your own 
safety  

The monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded LE blocks 
within the transmission These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol

So don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool LE about the 
tapping key  I bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than those suggested above Of course it's absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms and protocols remain secret Personally I doubt they will

Hi

I'd like to thank you all for the fast responses 
Special thanks go to those who replied lexical order

My question was

how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per
bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key

How much of the DESencrypted data is affected depends on the used
encryption mode According to Marcus J Ranum mjrTISCOM there is

	cfb  cipher feedback mode
	ecb  electronic code book mode
	cbc  cipher block chaining mode
	ofb  output feedback mode

	each mode does some stuff better than others ofb and cfb are designed
for communications streams more than for files

Unfortunally people strongly disagree which mode will lead to destruction
of all of the following data Sure seems that some modes will resync quite
fast others will never others will even only effect the very block

Summarized people said concerning this matter


In CBC mode only the current block will be affected tarnoldvnetIBMCOM 
Todd W Arnold

If you use CBC Cihper Block Chaining then the remainder of the data
will be destroyed as well pauschsaafse Paul Schlyter

In CFB mode DES synchronizes quite fast probably within  block 
according to Maracus J Ranum mjrTISCOM


Maybe someone definitely knows what happens in which mode

Nevertheless Thank you all very much again

Axel Dunkel

It depends on the mode you're using  For a single bit input block a
onebit error will have a  percent chance of corrupting each of the 
output bits  in other words it essentially turns the output block into
a random number  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode however only the
one bit block will be affected  The next block and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly

It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely

From pauschsaafse Paul Schlyter

In article adcat you write
Hello

how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per
bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key

At least  bytes of data will be destroyed if one bit encrypted data is
in error

If you use CBC Cihper Block Chaining then the remainder of the data
will be destroyed as well

DES is VERY seisitive for single bit errors  This is as it should be

Probably very bad you might lose the rest of the data stream  If you
want safety against dropped bits use an error correcting coder like the
freeware GNU ecc

From wcsanchorhoattcom

   how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per
   bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key

It depends on the mode you're using DES in
Electronic Code Book ECB takes a block of  input bits
and produces  output bits so if any bits are changed
the entire block of  bits becomes bad
I forget which feedback mode is which
In all of them the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks
With some modes the system selfsynchronizes so errors are repaired
in a few blocks  With other modes once one block is bad
all later blocks will be bad too

There's also the framing problem  If you have a bit change
the block that it's in changes and maybe later blocks also change
But if you have bits lost or bits added  bits in  or  bits out
everything is confused after that



From Marcus J Ranum mjrTISCOM

	depends on the mode you're using cfb for example synchronises
pretty fast figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the
next one

 You obviously haven't read the information about the system The chips

 I am against the proposal but lets be accurate in our objections
 

Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read  The system may
not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units but
it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some
suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys
from escrow

Big deal If you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a
legitimate wiretap order you just listen in on the line for 
minutes get the serial number and then take the order and go to the
escrow agencies If you notice the criminal is now using a different
phone instrument take your stillvalid wiretap order to the escrow
agency with the new serial number This provides opportunities for
abuse by law enforcement but thats not what we are discussing right
now I oppose Clipper but the mechanics here are simple and easy to
understand The whole rest of your article is based on a large series
of false premises all predicated on the notion that this simple act
is somehow impossible

I feel free to presume to tell you that you do not seem to understand
the mechanics of the proposal Arguing that terrorists will be killing
people for their clipper phones is silly because its pointless Lets
be alarmist about what really would show up as a problem shall we

The security of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys

The ability to tap is an inherent insecurity which depends fundamentally on
the secrecy of the algorithm  To spell it out because so many people seem to
miss the point if the algorithm were published anyone could create a chip
which would work correctly with the Skipjack chips but which would not have
its key registered

I believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the
government maintaining a secret of some kind  For example the secret could be
the private keys of the escrow agencies their digital signatures would be
required before a key could be used  In this case the NSANISTwhoever has
decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easiercheapermore secure than
other possible protocols

 As a private citizen I would feel much more secure in my person and
 papers knowing that an organization committed to individual civil
 liberties the ACLU and the NRA come to mind was safeguarding half of
 my key Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure
 by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported funded or
 overtly controlled by the government
 
Thats one problem that has so far been overlooked These two escrow
agencies will have to create a secure database and service the
input and output of Keys Who pays for this If they refuse an
illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their
budget by cut to punish them Will congress be forced to fund
them forever

Congress isn't forced to do ANYTHING  Not even follow their own rules
if it isn't expedient  If caught with their collective pants down
they make some funny noises perhaps crucify a skapegoat or two then
continue business as usual  I notice those senators involved with
the SL Scandal weren't hurt too much if at all  DeConcini's personal
stake in suppliers to those big Aerostats hasn't affected his credibility
at all inside Congress at least  He is still pushing his police state
agenda

The problem is that laws can change Congress may pass a law setting
up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private Some
future congress may change that law Suppose prenazi Germany had
a clipper system Do you think the escrow agencies would have
told Hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid 
court order

It will be like the old saw in New Jersey and New York Chicago etc
when the politicians PROMISED that this spiffy new gun registration law
will NOT be used for future confiscation purposes  Sure enough a few
years later when they WERE used JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE and folks
complained the response was Well I didn't make that promise
Some politicians may not even wait a few years  Escrowed keys would
have the same assurances of security  Besides if someone wants to
snoop how are YOU to know  you don't think they will send you a letter
saying We are now snooping on your private conversations do you
What are the assurances the escrow people will not be FORBIDDEN to
report any access attempts for one's keys

So much for government assurances of privacy

In effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of
the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance 
They will be able to directly tap into Federal funds with no
accountability to anyone except through a court challenge

How  The Feds will just change the law or just ignore it  Nothing
new here  They got the muscle the resources the guns

As an aside since export of crypto is verboten because of ITAR
shouldn't the Second Amendment also come into play here

extra attention to the point above  As cliched as the saying may be
it's nevertheless true that you can catch more flies with honey than

  While the writing styles prevalent on the net possess a certain charm
please remember that the person reading your letter is likely to be
uninfluenced or negatively influenced if you express your concerns in
a way that makes you sound like a flake or a paranoid crackpot  Wild
and unsupported accusations about the menace from the NSA will not
carry much weight nor are overblown conclusions about the inevitable
consequences of the proposal likely to convince especially not ones
that attempt strained analogies to the rise of the Nazi party  Please
save the Niemoller quote for another letter

  If you want your opinions to be taken seriously it is very important
that you state those opinions in a manner that is understandable and 
seems reasonable to a layman  Don't overburden your reader with technical
details or expect them to know the history of various encryption 
technologies  Before you mail it hand your letter to a nontechnical
friend and ask them to sanitycheck it

  Above all realize that legislators are often motivated as much by
selfinterest as by anything else  Try to point out risks in terms that
will be meaningful and motivating to them such as the loss of individual
privacy rights or the damage restrictive export regulations do to American
businesses' ability to compete in the global marketplace  Pull the 
strings that you think will work with your legislator  if your
legislator is unlikely to be swayed by civilrights concerns then point out
how a governmentgranted monopoly for Mycotronx damages the competitiveness
of businesses in your district that manufacture or market phone or crypto

It discredits the writer with third parties to claim Clipper has a back
door It does not
 
   Actually David I don't think it's any more intellectually honest to
say there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors unless you've
had a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely  For all
we know skipjack could be easily broken or impossible to break  And
clearly if skipjack is not secure then the clipper chip is not worth much

May I suggest that any any proposed cipher system
having less entropy than the user's key and message can have
an embedded subliminal channel as big as the
difference in entropies between the entropy of the user
input message and the entropy of the output

For example take plain DES  The unsuspecting
user inputs a string PLAINTEXT to be enciphered

He cranks the algorithm which has been hacked
by George Quisling and comes out with jHd

Nine char in and nine chars out  Right

The unsepecting user ships the ciphertext
to be decrpyted and the message PLAINTEXT
is produced  Everything fine right  Nope


Imagine the algorithm did a LZ compression
on PLAINTEXT before DESing Compressing is
down to four characters with more entropy

wj

The opponent now pads the message with his
own message also compressed

dk

before applying DES to the concatenated
compressed pairs  When decrpyted the
first compressed message is stripped off
and declared sent  Unbeknowst to the
receiver the opponents accomplice collects
the remaining message in the bit bucket and
uncompresses to KILL NOW

And to prevent all such subliminal or covert
storage channels you would need to have 
maximal entropy all the time  which is
a priori impossible because for example
a stereotypical message might be
replaced by one bit in the output reserving
the rest of the output bits for the long
covert message

In other words if you opponent get to muck
with the algorithm  you either have got to
muck with it LAST or concede his possible 
embedding of covert channels

In other words if you present a message
to an opponet with less than maximal entropy
then you have given him free bits of storage

 We don't know this do we  The algorithm is classified 

I speculate from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK that the algorithm 
is a classified cryptosystem similar in application to DES but cleared by 
the NSA for classified traffic that has been in use for a number of years  
Myktotronx refers to it as Government Type II encryption which matches the 
designation of one of the types of encryption available on STUIII phones 
and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called CIPHER

This would make sense since this is evidently a fieldproven cryptosystem 
which can act as a pincompatible substitute for DES  Combined with a 
tappable key exchange protocol this would offer exactly what is claimed for 
Clipper secure encryption with access via a key escrow  If this is fact the 
case it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself

Now I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem my knowledge 
of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy  it's nonexistent  However 
it would certainly have been the leasteffort approach on the part of the 
government take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES 
and which is at least as secure set up a key escrow scheme for law 
enforcement and promote it for public use  This also fits with Mykotronx 
who's been around but almost invisible for years

Has anyone else made this sort of connection or am I just hallucinating pink 
elephants here   My curiousity has been piqued

From article cyberiawinnet by johnstoncyberiawinnet Robert Johnston
 Encryption technologies are currently reguarded as arms by the
 Feds hence the export ban  While the Second is under enough
 attack for guarrentteing our rights to fire arms perhaps we
 should reflect on this as well  Perhaps fire arms are not the
 only weapons covered under the Second Amendment

Hmmm I wouldn't consider encryption to be a weapon  How would the
government classify encryption  Seems to me that encryption ought to
be covered by the first amendment   Using this line of reasoning the
government shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and
what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting
one's freedom of speech  In other words encrypted datatext
graphics or other informationis just another form of free speech
For this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use
of encryption algorithms and encrypted data  The only time the
government should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her
encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data
in question may be something that isn't protected by the first
amendment such as kiddy porn  Even in a case like this the
government should be required to get a search warrant before coercing
someone into revealing the keys

BTW what encryption methods are considered to be stateoftheart
nowdays  Have the feds relaxed export restrictions on DES yet
Also is DES still regarded as a good form of encryption

I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed
an interesting omission from the discussion

You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed 
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software

The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips
and reverse engineer it I mean take the thing to a chip testing
analysis facility one with a decent electron microscope Just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry I remembered a place that I use
to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out while running tests They could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was 

I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities
and that the potential is there especially at a university where the
security at such a facility is looser for someone to take a clipper
apart and analyze it

What can the government do to prevent this Start taking away all 
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes

BTW I'm working on one

Dear SenatorCongressmanPresident fill in the blank

I am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton's Clipper 
Chip initiative This proposal to establish a secret government designed
cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
encryption is very disturbing The idea that citizens must register their 
secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret 
is patently unAmerican Additionally the press release for this program
strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the 
Clipper Chip standard is in place This latest attack on our civil rights is 
deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me 

The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this 
is not the case The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment 
is avalible the criminals drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press 
release will simply use non clipper cryptography Meanwhile the average citizen
may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the 
government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation This seems like an 
obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement If you still do nott 
understand my objection to key registration consider the way J Edgar Hoover 
blackmailed government officials like yourself would you now use a phone to 
transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to

How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper
decision 

How can the bulk of the people be informed when the media refuses to
do it

The answer to your second question lies in the way you phrased the
first one  'the media is'

The medis isn't 'is'  The media 'are'  'Media' means 'more than one
medium'  There are thousands of publications  Some say this some say
that  

     How can the bulk of the people be informed when they won't read
     informative publications

Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative
publications  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand
Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment with
the usual trade journals all they ever see is the media note media
in this context is the popular media  TV radio daily newspapers and
such publications as Time Newsweek and all that  And they all say
pretty much the same thing  I see most of them being in the range of
centerleft to far Left and generally supportive of pieinsky
wewilltake careofyouthinkforyoucradletograve  There seems
to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of
understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them
as with Clipper for example or tells the people how to interpret
events in others  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good
at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information
about them  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be
clarirvoyant  For example I would have been unaware of Clipper had
I not picked it up on USENET  How much of the population has USENET
let alone Internet access

For access to better publications the person has to spend time digging
Many folks especially who work long hours have families etc do not
have TIME to go digging and many are not yet aware things are wrong
so are not motivated to dig  Not saying its right just saying that is
the way things are  People aren't upset about things when they aren't
TOLD  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the
problem

And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service
bureaucrats politicians that act as if the person without political
connections or deep pockets potential contributer should have few if
any rights being a resource to be used by those in control for their
polticial or financial gain  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if
they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt
peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD and get very nasty
when someone questions them  The media punditseditors etc tend to
fall into those with privilege and tend to not be upset by the current
state of affairs  The fellow in DC who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi
for daring to swim in it with an ILLEGALLY owned gun violating the law
he pushed to be foisted on everyone else ends up walking where a less
wellconnected person would have been crucified  A typical example of
one standard for 'us' a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'

Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this but the solution
sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is
going on or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position
where one feels they are exempt or insulated  Such as that hypocrite of
a journalist in DC described above  One notices that these lessthan
complimentary points about that doublestandard was NOT covered in the
media  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views
on the subject and it involved a 'brother' journalist

Isn't it time for our 'objective' media the MAIN SOURCE of info for the
average person to start being what they claim to be instead of spin
doctors for the Statist elements

  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY  THWARTING THE STATE VIA
                     TECHNOLOGY

  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference November 


     You   know   technologyand   particularly   computer
technologyhas often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir
cles  We tend to think of Orwell's  or Terry Gilliam's
Brazil  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's
slavecitizens on their own side of the border or  the  so
phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on
his enemies list  Or we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman and permit him to paw thru our be
longings if it beeps

     But I think that mindset is a mistake   Before  there
were cattle prods governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses    Before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping governments used binoculars and  lipreaders
Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools

     In fact technology represents one of the most  promis
ing  avenues  available  for  recapturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them  By its very nature  it  favors
the  bright  who can put it to use over the dull who can
not  It favors the adaptable who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new  over  the sluggish who cling to time
tested ways  And what two better words are  there  to  de
scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish

     One  of  the  clearest  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  manportable
crossbow   With it an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meterseven  if
that  target  were  a mounted chainmailed knight  Unlike
the longbow which admittedly was more powerful and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize   Whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder sight along the
arrow  itself and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar
get

     Moreover since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors the utility of the  device  was
plain    With it the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another but against their governmental
masters   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor
piercing  bullet  and consequently kings and priests the
medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol  Tobacco  and
Crossbows  threatened  death  and  excommunication respec
tively for its unlawful possession

     Looking at later developments we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearmparticularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced
machine gunsradically altered the balance of interpersonal
and intergroup power  Not without reason was the Colt  
called the equalizer  A frail dancehall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon    Advertise
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  a  man  on
horseback  armed with one of these rifles simply cannot be
captured  And as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  singleshot rifles the quote is doubtless a
true one

     Updating now to  the  present  the  publickey  cipher
with  a  personal  computer to run it represents an equiv
alent quantum leapin a defensive weapon    Not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's
own possession but it can also permit two strangers to  ex
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channela  wiretapped   phone   line   for   example   or
skywriting for that matterwithout ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys   With a thousanddollar com
puter you can create a cipher that  a  multimegabuck  CRAY
XMP  can't  crack in a year  Within a few years it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi
cations soon after that fullcolor digitized video images
Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete  it
will  have  totally demolished government's control over in
formation transfer

     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat
ics  which makes this principle possible  This algorithm is
called the RSA algorithm after Rivest Shamir and  Adleman
who  jointly created it  Its security derives from the fact
that if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product    Ex
tremely  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 
digits apiece then their digit product cannot  in  gen
eral be factored in less than  years by the most powerful
computer now in existence

     The  public part of the key consists of  the prod
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q and   one  fac
tor  call it  x   of the product  xy  where  xy  p 
q    The private part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y

     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integereither by using ASCII  or  even  a  simple
A  B  C   Z representation  This integer
is then raised to the power  x modulo pq and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message  The receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  secret  power    y
modulo  pq  It can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with

     What makes this a groundbreaking development  and  why
it  is  called  publickey  cryptography  is  that I can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x     while
keeping  secret  the number  y  so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message namely
                       x
                     a    mod pq  
but only I can recover the original message  a   by  taking
what  they  send raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result mod pq  The risky step meeting to exchange cipher
keys has been eliminated  So people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet may  still  reliably  ex
change  encrypted  messageseach  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x     while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y

     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a dig
ital signature to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message  Normally if I want to send you a message
I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  mod
your pq  and send that

    However  if in my message I take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my secret power  y   take the result  mod my
pq then raise that result to your x   mod  your  pq  and
send this then even after you have normally decrypted the
message  it  will still look like garbage  However if you
then raise it to my public power x    and take  the  result
mod  my public pq   so you will not only recover the ori
ginal plaintext message but you will know that no one but I
could have sent it to you since no one else knows my secret
y

     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to
day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of
personal  computers    On the one hand they recognize that
American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to bemore so in
fact because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest  and instruct  and yearolds  And it is pre
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
headtohead against their Soviet  counterparts    For  the
Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics    On  the  other hand whatever else a personal
computer may be it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machinea floppy disk will hold upwards of  words  of
text  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes  If this
weren't threatening enough the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac
cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown   The relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten
sively than machine guns are in the United States

     Now  the  conservative position is that we should not
sell these computers to the Soviets because they could  use
them  in weapons systems  The liberal position is that we
should sell them in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperationand  anyway  if  we don't make the sale there
will certainly be some other nation willing to

     For my part I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian
position should be to give them to the Soviets for free and
if  necessary make them take them    and if that doesn't
work load up an SR  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
Moscow in the middle of the night  Paid for by private sub
scription of course not taxation    I confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional leftright political spectrum but af
ter all in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters we
are political nonEuclideans   The shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a straight line    Taking  a  long  enough
worldview  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and indeed to the ultimate dissolution of
the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at Moscow

     But  there's  the rub  A long enough world view does
suggest that the evil the oppressive the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will get what they deserve but what's not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed enslaved or pauperized in the process

    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at
tack freedom they possessed a reasonably  stable  healthy
functioning economy and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it    A  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable    But  now  we  have
patchwork  crazyquilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit  The state not only taxes us to  feed  the  poor
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food pricesit then simultaneously turns around and sub
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive  Or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago  When the price went up  we  were  told  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy  The price increase
was called the moral equivalent of war and the Feds  swung
into  action    For the first time in American history the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be
came an issue of Federal concern   Now when the  price  of
oil  drops again we risk problems this time because Ameri
can oil companies and Third World  basketcase  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly overextended banks  The suggested panacea is  that
government  should now reraise the oil prices that OPEC has
lowered via a new oil tax  Since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did
what  can we call this except the moral equivalent of civil
warthe government against its own people

     And classically in international trade can you imag
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place

     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  libertieswe
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them   I contend  that  there
exists  almost  a  black  hole  effect in the evolution of
nationstates just as in the evolution of stars  Once free
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent reemergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible  A good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of socalled welfare payments  When those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber and thus outvote those
whose taxes must replenish the trough  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many  Go
down to the nearest welfare office find just  two  people
on  the dole    and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your lifeand the fruits of your life's labor

     So essentially those who love liberty need an edge of
some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail  We obvi
ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  otherdirectedness  of
work  slave suffer sacrifice so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world
Recognize  that however immoral such an appeal might be it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture
If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
cause caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
workingthen you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from  Equally clearly this is just the sort of ap
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals  If I were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like Listen follow me as I enunciate my
noble cause contribute your money to support the cause
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the cause strive
selflessly to bring it about and then after you  and  your
children are dead maybe your children's children will actu
ally  live under egoismyou'd all think I'd gone mad  And
of course you'd be right  Because the point I'm  trying  to
make is that libertarianism andor egoism will be spread if
when and as individual libertarians andor egoists find it
profitable andor enjoyable to do so    And  probably  only
then

     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli
tical  action I don't believe that it is the only nor even
necessarily the most costeffective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time  Consider that for a fraction of the
investment in time money and effort I might expend in  try
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorshipI can teach every libertarian who's in
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally

     There  is  a  maxima proverbgenerally attributed to
the Eskimoes which very likely most Libertarians  have  al
ready  heard    And while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying you might well feel that you've heard  it  often
enough already and that it has nothing further to teach us
and moreover that maybe you're even tired of hearing it  I
shall therefore repeat it now

     If you give a man a fish the saying runs you feed him
for a day  But if you teach a man how to fish you feed him
for a lifetime

     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  workfare  vs  welfare  context  namely that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance not simply how to  beg  for  it
And of course this is true if only because the next time he
is hungry there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish whereas with the information on how
to fish he is completely self sufficient

     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it  I would have wasted your time by citing it
again  After all it seems to have almost a cryptoaltruist
slant as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter

     But consider

     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses   You on the other hand
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things and
they ate most of the fish you could catch  And now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge   Well  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a winner and a loser the
idea that if one person gains it must necessarily be at the
expense of another person who loses  Clearly under  this
scenario such is not the case  Each party has gained some
thing  he  did  not have before and neither has been dimin
ished in any way  When it comes to exchange of  information
rather  than material objects life is no longer a zerosum
game  This is an extremely powerful notion   The  law  of
diminishing   returns   the  first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamicsall those laws which constrain our possi
bilities in other contextsno longer bind us   Now  that's
anarchy

     Or  consider  another possibility  Suppose this hungry
Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nationstate    had  decreed fishing illegal   Because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones and sometimes sharp spines he
tells us the state has decreed that their  consumptionand
even  their  possessionare  too  hazardous to the people's
health to be permitted    even by knowledgeable  willing
adults   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern
ment  property    Or perhaps it is because the state gener
ously extends to competent adults the benefits it provides
to children and to the mentally ill  namely  a  fulltime
allpervasive supervisory conservatorshipso that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally naughty  But in  any
case  you  stare stupefied while your Eskimo informant re
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of pos
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute

     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings  You may go far
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion
ary recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant's goal  Your rationale may be altruistic  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed  or
egoistic in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressoror  very likely some combination of these or per
haps even other motives

     But since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your cause you're not about to mount a military campaign
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade
However it is here that technologyand in  particular  in
formation technologycan multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold    I say literally because for a fraction of
the effort and virtually none of  the  risk  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish you can quite readily produce a
hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions  If the tar
geted government like presentday America at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re
stricted  then that should suffice  But if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical Eskimo's publickey parameters  But as far as
increasing realworld access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headwaywhich  may  continue to snowball as others
redisseminate the information you have provided   And  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id
eological  adversaries or even trying to win over the unde
cided  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  Freedom  in  an
Unfree World that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua
sion is necessary to its fulfilment

     If  you  look  at  history you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington
Lincoln        Nixon      Marcos    Duvalier   
Khadaffi     and their ilk  But it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like Edison Curie Marconi Tesla and
Wozniak  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per
vasive and not nearly so bloody

     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech
Project  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en
slave plunder or constrain us I propose a libertarian net
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves

     But here we must be a bit careful  While it is not at
present  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you there is no guarantee of what  the  fu
ture  may hold  There have been bills introduced for exam
ple which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you  That is if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own
This law to my knowledge has not passed    yet     but
it does indicate how government thinks

     Other  technological  applications  however do indeed
pose legal risks  We recognize for  example  that  anyone
who  helped a preCivil War slave escape on the underground
railroad was making a clearly illegal use of technologyas
the sovereign government of the United States of America  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle  Simi
larly during Prohibition anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug
alcoholthe controlled substance winewas using  technol
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his crimeunfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  Congress  reversed itself and repermitted use of this
drug

     So    to quote a former President  unindicted  co
conspirator  and pardoned felon    Let me make one thing
perfectly clear  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate
participate  in or conspire in the violation of any lawno
matter how oppressive  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be  It does engage in description for educa
tional and informational  purposes  only  of  technological
processes  and some of these processes like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm may well require appropriate li
censing to perform legally    Fortunately  no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it
self

     So the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair  thinking  Well  if  of the nation and  of
this State and  of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian
before  I'll  be  free  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now and put me out of my  miseryrecognize
that  such  is not the case  There exist ways to make your
self free

     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project
you are welcome to give me your name and addressor a  fake
name  and  mail  drop for that matterand you'll go on the
mailing list for my erraticallypublished newsletter    Any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well  I'm not even asking for stamped  self
addressed envelopes since my printer can handle mailing la
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out   If you
should have an idea to share or even a  useful  product  to
plug  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication
Even if you want to be the proverbial free rider and  just
benefit  from  what others contributeyou're still welcome
Everything will be public domain feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away or sell it for that matter 'cause if you can
get  money  for  it while I'm taking fullpage ads trying to
give it away you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit     Anyway every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer and I'm certainly
willing to underwrite that at least for the forseeable  fu
ture

     I  will leave you with one final thought  If you don't
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they
outlaw  swords  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too

At the risk of getting lost in the clipper chip discussion I give a  
summary on my recent question

In article PQSCBCNHminniezdvunimainzde I wrote
 The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search
 attack  
 against DES is quite feasible now But normally DES is applied in CBC or 
 CFB  
 mode where one chooses a random init vector of  bytes Questions
 
   Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key Then
 we have  
 a      bit key
  
   If yes Is anything known about the security of this key scheme Can 
 we  
 break it faster than by exhaustive search through the  bit key space

Unfortunately the answer is no  concealing the initialisation vector  
essentially doesn't give any additional security I got  answers from  
gradynetcomcom MarkLomasclcamacuk smbresearchattcom that  
opened my eyes It's pretty simple

Say E is encryption and D decryption with key K on bit blocks

Let c be the initialisation vector
m m  the message blocks
c c  the cipher text blocks

Then encryption in cipher block chaining CBC mode works by the formula

   ci  Emi XOR ci

and decryption by

   mi  ci XOR Dci

So if the attacker doesn't have c this only affects the first message  
block m But she can do her key search attack on m m 

The situation in cipher feedback CFB mode is a bit more complicated but  
similar and left as an exercise for the reader 

Finally there is the modified output feedback mode OFB where DES or  
whatever block cipher you use simply acts as random generator by

   si  Esi with initialisation vector  seed s

and encryption is given by

   ci  mi XOR si

Here the usual known plaintext' attack against XORbitstream ciphers  
reduces the cracking to key search for K

The security of the system should depend only on the secrecy of
the keys and not on the secrecy of the algorithms  Dorothy Denning

jhartagoraraincom


You're reading far too much into this aside from the obvious fact
that you shouldn't hold anybody to what they wrote in a  year old
book in a rapidly changing field like this


Quite simply she says that the security should not DEPEND on the
secrecy of the algorithm  A secret algorithm can still be secure
after all we just don't know it  Only our level of trust is
affected not the security of the system

The algorithm could be RSA for all we know which we believe to
be secure

They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to
protect its security  They want to protect its market share

If they publish the algorithm then shortly manufacturers would
make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not
use a key stored in escrow  And of course everybody would buy them


The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that
you can only use if you follow their rules they get us to follow
their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and
nail

Quite simply with Clipper established it would be much harder for
another encryption maker to define a new standard to make phones that
can't talk to the leading phone companies   The result is tappable
cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds for  of the
populace


To get untappable crypto you would have to build a special phone that
runs on top of this system and everybody you talk to would have to
have an indentical one

That's the chicken and egg of crypto  The government is using its
very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new
technologies to control this one in a way they like


It's almost admirably clever  When the EFF started I posed the question here
What are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they
can't wiretap and nobody here had an answer or even thought it was
much of a question

Then came the backdoor and Digital Telephony bills which we fought

Now we have their real answer the cleverest of all

          Is it realistic for the government to try to keep the details
 of the encrytion algorithm secret if it intends to use evidence from
                           James B Shearer

I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all However
using the info they gather while listening they can go searching THE right
place and find good strong evidence which they can use in court 

Question  currently it is easy to wiretap from the technical point of
view at least Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen
to communications between a cartelephone and the ground station The police
also obviously The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the
nonauthorized person to eavesdrop note that I DO NOT write  impossible 
The privacy will thus improve from the current situation Poeple who REALLY
have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things
If an illegal operation is really worth one can afford having critical data
carried by a person rather than sending it electronically 
The clipper chip will not change this 

The problem is more politic Foreign countries will never accept the clipper
chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own
police following their OWN law not the US law ie each country will have
its own escrow How then will it be possible to monitor the international
traffic or will encrypted international traffic be possible  or will there
be an international escrow some kind of UN thing 

Forbidding crypted communication is impractical how is it possible to spot
a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate
on the various existing networks What about private networks  And this will
be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase
in the next years

I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the
risk of  for instance one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's
communications It will bring no more as regards to security Is it worth 
I think so if its cost is limited I think that many privacy invasions are done
not only by official services but also by private entities The clipper can
help reducing these Provided we do not hope too much of it it is not a real
danger and it can be helpful

  I believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the
 government maintaining a secret of some kind

  Not necessarily  For instance in the system outlined in the May 
issue of Byte the process of getting one's public key listed for general
use involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies which
do calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers of
the public key directory which combines these results into your listed
public key  If you try to give the escrow agencies pieces which don't
yield your private key when they are all put together the result is that
the public key listed for you is wrong and you can't read messages encrypted
to you

I suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from
offering secure encryption services  Big companies don't take that
kind of risk  They're too visible and have too much to lose

The US government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its
use  If they could credibly say to IBM or MIT you will receive no US
government money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on
use of encryption I doubt either organization would delay making use of
encryption a violation of local policies  The US government gets much of
its power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the
government while putting restrictions on use of such money that would be
illegal if they were enacted as laws

Yesterday I read an article from someone who was requesting references for
introductory texts on cryptography  Although I marked the article to
return it appears to have expired on this site

Anyway on one of the previous occasions when this subject arose I saved
a couple articles which made suggestions  One of the articles contained
a quite impressive bibliography  If the poster of the request or anyone
else would like to email me I would be glad to send out copies of these

I heard somewhere can't name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pickup just CRTs but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip  If
that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be pickedup from the video controller  Can anybody verify
or refute this

You are correct several times TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard shared between the NATO governments to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction The limits set in the 
standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect 
that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be 
exploited It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic 
field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons

Among other things I drive a  Korean built AT clone and an associated  pin dotmatrix printer The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT To that can be added the video driver card the RS parallel cable and the 
printer head The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the 
crudest of equipment Were I to apply good test equipment and some 
intelligence to measuring emission levels I would find many other potential 
sources of leaked information

Where cryptography is used for serious purposes poor TEMPEST protection 
becomes an important security hazard

In the early eighties the need to allow some commercial concerns 
particularly financial institutions a level of protection against TEMPEST 
threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 
'release' of a cutdown TEMPEST stansard for commercial use I say 'release' 
for while equipment to meet the standard is available at a price and to 
approved customers AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified If
you think about it it would really have to wouldn't it

This is stupid  Won't it cost more to those companies hoping to 
serve the gov't and private markets if they DON'T use the same
technology

        I would guess that they won't use Clipper at all  What they will
do is use their STUIIIs amoung themselves and the governmental agencies
they need to talk to and ignore Clipper  After all if it's not secure
enough for the agencydepartment they are communicating with why should
the coprations trust it

      But I think that mindset is a mistake   Before  there
 were cattle prods governments tortured their prisoners with
 clubs  and  rubber  hoses    Before  there  were lasers for
 eavesdropping governments used binoculars and  lipreaders
 Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress the
 evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools

Evil and good walk hand in hand  It is also important to note that
the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools

      In fact technology represents one of the most  promis
 ing  avenues  available  for  recapturing our freedoms from
 those who have stolen them

I cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic  Technology is neutral
to good or evil  When technology is used by evil men it is called
evil technology  When it is used by good men it is called good
technology  Really it is just technology that allows action to be
realized more efficently and on a larger scale

 By its very nature  it  favors
 the  bright  who can put it to use over the dull who can
 not

Try not to confused the development of technology with its use
Certainly bright people will be better at creating technology but
even young children know how to program VCR machines  Are VCR
machines not extremely complex to create

 It favors the adaptable who are  quick  to  see  the
 merit  of  the  new  over  the sluggish who cling to time
 tested ways

Adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the
stiff and stubborn  A young child is soft and supple an old man is
stiff and inflexible  A dripping of water can cut through stone
This has nothing to do with technology rather technology just
allows us to magnify action

 And what two better words are  there  to  de
 scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish

I have no objection to this

My father having worked for American Cyanamid for sometime did mention
that the recipe is a secret Neither of us know of just how toxic
the stuff isbut you can synthesize a simliar substance that is
available to just about any organic labcalled Luminol  You can usually
find this in an organic lab book or something similiar 

These substances are normally not the secret but how to get at them The 
method of preperation is normally patented which means that noone else can 
make the chemical in the same way without undergoing an agreement with 
American Cyanamid But I guess you knew what a patent is  

If you know what substance is used you'll also know its toxicity

Rumor has it that luminol is some base form for the stuff used in the 
light sticks

The Luminol reaction has the disadvantage of not lasting as long as the 
commercial version

Remember that cyano compounds are found in nature and not all are poisonous

  I don't know about that they might if they find it the most expedient
way to keep people from using something they can't crack

Let's put it this way they have a charter and several executive orders
to obey among other things which explicitly prohibit sharing this
information unless things have changed withing the last little while
I suppose they could ignore it if they choose  But I doubt they would

Anything can be an emissions problem right down to the video cable  Given
the right equipment you can pick the screen paint from the cable  But
given any cable you must know what is being sent through it to know the

You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed 
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software

The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips
and reverse engineer it I mean take the thing to a chip testing
analysis facility one with a decent electron microscope Just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry I remembered a place that I use
to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out while running tests They could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was 

I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities
and that the potential is there especially at a university where the
security at such a facility is looser for someone to take a clipper
apart and analyze it

What can the government do to prevent this Start taking away all 
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes


They are using some technology developed by VLSI systems the other manufacturer of
the Clipper Chips that produces chips that are supposed to be highly resistant to
reverse engineering

I suspect that Prof Denning is actually using the attacks as an excuse for

 They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to 
 protect its security  They want to protect its market share 

That's one way to put it  Keeping the algorithm classified means that 
disclosure of it falls under the rubric of national security  Nothing like 
federal marshalls to guard a monopoly

 The result is tappable 
 cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds for  of the 
 populace 

Agreed although this is still somewhat better than the status quo 

 To get untappable crypto you would have to build a special phone that 
 runs on top of this system and everybody you talk to would have to 
 have an indentical one 

Sounds like a job for the Free Software Foundation

about scanning clipper and reverseengineering the algorithm
Am I missing something obvious here What could have the government done
to address this possibility Do they really care if it stays classified

	Yeah you're missing the obvious fact that since the algorithm
is classified if you reverse engineer it from the chip and later
publish it or build a compatible chip you're divulging classified
information and are in a big load of trouble

I don't think they can do that without changing the law  The chip itself
isn't classified and reverse engineering is allowed by law possibly
unless prohibited by a valid contract  The algorithm may be classified
but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information but obtained from unclassified sources is freely
publishable with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information

Now given that today's rum runners coke runners actually have even more

So my question of the FBINISTNSA is How are you going to make the rum
runners use the Clipper Chip

Answer  	you're not

Question	OK  in that case your justification for taking away our
		rights has evaporated  How do you justify our loss of rights
		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists

 If I want to talk to someone I don't need to have previously exchanged
 keys with him I just call him up and the phones establish a session key
 for us using a zeroknowledge algorithm or something of the kind  If I've
 misunderstood this part it probably invalidates the rest of this notion
 
 This lends itself to spoofing

 I go buy a pair of Clipper phones to go on a pair of phone lines in a back
 room somewhere and have the digital switch programmed to redirect his
 calls to one of my two lines instead of to his whenever he receives a
 call  The two phones are wired backtoback in the clear


 Anyone see any problem with this scheme other than to assume that all
 public officials and phone company employees are totally incorruptible

As far as I can see no matter how the session keys are generated be it
DiffieHellman or whatever any Cripple conversation which travels in
whole or in part over a landline is vulnerable to this scheme  Law
enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco or illegally by finding
some part of the phone line that they can cut into  The degree of risk
depends very much on location  not good in the middle of a busy street
but not bad on a line in open country leading to a drug lord's ranch  The
only way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public
key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call all
of them  totally impractical even if some part of the Cripple algorithm
could be used as a kind of public key I don't understand enough about these
things to know

This sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link
and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for
other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone

Gosh yet another way to get round Cripple encryption  How many is that
we've found so far  And that's without even knowing the details of the
algorithm

I don't wish to rehash the PGP patent issue at all but I do feel
that some potential misconceptions in interpretting intellectual property
laws need to be raised

In article arubindsgdsebeckmancom arubindsgdsebeckmancom Arthur Rubin writes

If PGP violates RSAs patents then only executing PGP could be a violation
Distributing PGP could be contributory infringement but the PGP
documentation seemed sufficient to me to protect distributors before I
deleted it  using PGP might be a patent violation in the US so I have no
need to keep it

You are correct that executing PGP would be a violation unless the patent
were declared invalid by the courts but  there is a question as
to when how or if distributing PGP would be a violation  If the person
or company distributing PGP receives money for doing so then it is
clearly a sale for example if it were on Compuserve they charge you
for access so they would be selling PGP  When there is no charge for
PGP things get less clear but there would still be a reasonable view
that it is inducing an infringement

  nb re Jim Bidzos
You have no legal action you can take unless you believe you can prove
someone is using PGP in the US for a purpose other than that specifically
allowed by patent laws  Not entirely correct anyone can sue for any
reason but you cannot prevail unless you can prove that by a prepoderance
of evidence  Under patent laws PGP does have legitimate uses as a means
to study your algorithm in order to produce improvements which would
still require your approval to execute until the patent runs out around


This is a common misconception  The patent laws do not mention any valid
purpose for infringing a patent  Although it is clear that in order to
create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing
a prior patent one must perform research on an existing patent  To
just say that you infringed a patent assume we're not talking the RSA
patent only for research purposes wink wink nudge nudge and then never
develop any related invention ie only use it would be a clear
infringement

You could just as well use a  character password to perform the encryption
of the  zero bits  One simple method would be to use the first  characters
to encrypt the  zero bits and then use the remaining  characters to
encrypt the result again  The output would still be  bits which encodes
into  ASCII characters

Wouldn't this method be vulnerable against a birthday attack
Currently a cracker needs to find the only  key that produces
the given ciphertext  He has to try about  keys on the average
In the proposed method the cracker only needs any pair of key halves
If he can store about  guesses for one half he is likely to find
a mathching pair in about  guesses  Here I have assumed that the
DESencryption is reversable if the key is guessed  Is this so or do
the modifications of the Sboxes by the salt bits make it nonreversable

 Probably there is only one key I think there is  chance in about 
that there are two or more keys can anyone verify this but this doesn't
help the cracker much

 What if clipper is fairly secure but leaves a distinct clipper signature
 that is what if it's not too difficult to tell that a msg was clipper
 encrypted even if you can't tell the contents  In that case anyone 
 who is trying to hide behind anther encryption scheme will stand out
 from all of the other traffic and raise a red flag to the NSA etc

I think the obvious answer which may have been posted but I haven't
seen it is to encrypt your data with some other scheme then run it
through clipper  The only way the police will be able to detect the
other encryption is through a wiretap so even if they do notice with
an illegal wiretap I have a hard time seeing a judge issuing a
warrant for a search to confiscate the illegal scheme assuming that
at one day it comes to this a worse case based on an illegal
wiretap  Then again maybe I am an idealist

OK if you've read this group for a while you know all about the
onetimepad but here's a question I haven't seen

The onetimepad yeilds ideal security but has a wellknown flaw in
authentication  Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad and
exclusiveor as the encryption operation  If an adversary knows the 
plaintext of a message he can change it into any other message  
Here's how it works

Alice is sending Bob a plaintext P under a key stream S
Alice computes the ciphertext C  S xor P  and sends it to Bob

Eve knows the plainext P but wants the message to appear as P'
Eve intercepts C and computes  C'  C xor P xor P'  S xor P'
Eve sends C' to Bob

Bob decrypts C' by computing  C'xor S  P'  thus receiving the 
false message which was substituted by Eve


Now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information
theoretic security not just computational security
Can we define something like ideal authentication which is the
analog of ideal security  Can we obtain ideal authentication 

If not how much can we limit Eve's control over the message 

If we can achieve ideal authentication does the solution use more
key bits or expand the message   Can we show the solution to be
optimal in one or more parameters 

Does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before

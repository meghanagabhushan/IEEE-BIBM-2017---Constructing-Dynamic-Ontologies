There are a variety of waterproof housings I could use but the real meat
of the problem is the electronicshence this posting  What kind of
transmission would be reliable underwater in murky or even nighttime
conditions  I'm not sure if sound is feasible given the distortion under
waterobviously direction would have to be accurate but range could be
relatively short I imagine  or   hundred yards would be more than enough

Jim McDonald

Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS
     
  

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications
For a review refer to ElectricalExperimenter March  and June 

Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War and was
unclassified after the war Supposedly the government rethought this
soon after and Rogers was convieniently forgotten

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated by the square of the distance but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all Furthermore
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception the underground antennas would recieve virtually noisefree

IF you find this hard to believe then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless Tesla Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods
were correct while Hertzian wave theory was completely abberant


 ET   Tesla was  years ahead of his time Perhaps now his time comes

A couple of years ago I put together a Tesla circuit which
was published in an electronics magazine and could have been
the circuit which is referred to here This one used a
flyback transformer from a tv onto which you wound your own
primary windings It also used  power transistors in a TO 

 years ago I built a ' volt Tesla and the thing was VERY
spectacular but besides scaringamazing friends depending on their
knowledge of Science and generating strong EMI I never found anything
useful that could be done with it   Is there any realworld application
for Tesla coils today 

David Prutchi

First of all realize that Tesla invented AC power generators motors
transformers conductors etc Technically ALL transformers are Tesla
coils  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil they mean
an air core resonant transformer The TV flyback version Tesla
coil see the EncyclopediaofElectronicCircuits V  for
diagram has NOT an air core It is of a class of circuit called
Oscillating Shuttle Circuit OSC Generally OSC's are highly
efficient but this version uses transistors and resistors
which are very lossy devices Typically Tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors so that he could achieve
efficiencies of  and better The usual application of an aircore
resonant transformer or of an OSC is to produce strong EMI
for wireless broadcasts How well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla flyback coil
from it If we were to remove from our homes and industries all
Tesla coils our lights would go dark our cars would sputter
and die our radios would go silent our industries would grind
to a halt and we would have to go back to using coal for heat
gas for lamps horses for transportation steam for power and
telegraph for communication Is that real world enough for you

GET THE MESSAGE WE WOULD NOT HAVE  THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE
TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE

If it had been up to Edison we'd still be in the th century
flame me at your own peril I'm very good at putting edison down

Similarly people usually use dB for dBm Another common mistake is spelling
db'' instead of dB'' as you did in your article See the B'' is for 
Bell'' company the mother of ATT and should be capitalized

Thus a deciBell deci l tenth of  Bell is a fractional part of the 
original Bell  For example SouthWestern Bell is a deciBell

And the measure of current Amp is actually named after both the AMP company
and the Amphenol company  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
were affected by the amount of current running through the wires

The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus
our use of the Ohms


Alexander Graham Bell actually is where Bell came from

For an upcoming project I want to use  Megs of DRAM configured as two 
Meg banks of  bit data  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a
DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data  It's ok if the
controller doesn't handle bank switching  that part is easy

The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National
Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook  edition eg DP  I would
like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to
implement in my circuit

BTW if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller Dallas
Semiconductor makes a neat chip the DS Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer
Chip  It uses the SPI IC bus and refreshescontrols up to Mx of DRAM
memory  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the
power is off  Price is  from Dallas quan   I wish I could use
this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is  MHz too slow for me

C Hi
C I have a DXMHz computer to use with an AD board
C for data acquisition on an AT busI'm having problems
C The AT bus runs at  MHz  correct  So there should
C be no bus speed conflict But I read somewhere that the
C new DX MHz CPU runs on a  MHz bus  is that for
C the local bus or the AT bus also  if so then I have a problem
C 
C When I run on nonturbomode the speed goes to  MHz and the
C AD doesn't work  Please mail your views  Thanks

C 

The STANDARD AT bus ISA runs at MHz not  MHz but some 
nonstnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates but be careful since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates  For instance my 
 has adjustable AT bus speeds and my PAS audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than MHz

The fact that nonturbomode speed AD doesn't work is weird  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'  

 MHz bus on the DX  does refer to the local bus  FYI the AT bus 
operates asynchronously and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface' which is one function that your 'chipset'

R JD ALL PC parallel ports that are compatable with the IBM standard
R JD including the original IBM adaptor are bidirectional

NOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BIDIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original s proves that  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them RW select line of the circuit to Vcc  To make it bi  which 
I did  I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
the proper location  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
Zenith  they were not ZenithBull Group at that time

These circuits abound in most electronic project books  If you're more
inclined to buy something try Radio Shack  I think they still have a
device that is designed to disconnect an answering machine when an
extension line is lifted  It has LED indicators also

Hi there

I am looking for a high quality logstereo k pot for an audio 
preamplifier  The design specifies Alps RKGA k AX but I cannot
find it anywhere  Any suggestions

The best pots around IMHO are made by Penny  Giles in the UK Their
basic model has a solid brass case and conductive plastic elements
matched to dB across the whole rotation The downside is that they
cost upwards of  quid each 

The PG pots are very good  The Alps ones are usually carried by
the same folks who run the Audio Amateur magazine  

I'll also recommend the Noble potentiometers if you don't mind weird
metric sizes on everything

Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a
couple of the ideas I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil
spec version of Exar's XR timercounter chip It is stable down to  C
and sucks very little power They show an application for a ultralong time
delay up to several years depending on the RC time constant In this
application they have two of them cascaded together The reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled In this configuration the output is high when the system is reset
When triggered the output goes low and stays that way for a total of  x
the timing cycle of the first chip The total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from To   x R x C to  x R x C in  steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output The beauty of it
is the timebase chip would only have to have a uF timing cap and a K
resistor for  seconds per timing cycle So I can get a maximum of
 seconds between timing cycles  x  or about  days 
Of course that's much more than I need  days But the counter allows for
 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'
After the first  days and it trips it would reset its self for the next 
day timing cycle and so forth

Power is still a problem though A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow as an insulator and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack I like that idea  This thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are  volts
to spit the pellets out onto the snow Anyway I ordered the XR's to see
what I can do with them Should be interesting as long as I'm not the one that
has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns
off 

Thanks again everyone

 					David Jacobowitz
 					dgjyvirginiaedu
 
 Oh no you're not the only one Analogue scopes give you or me at
 least a fair idea of what's going on in a circuit Digital scopes
 seem to have a habit of inventing a sizable part of it Eg even
 when there are only a few samples per period our HPA displays a
 continuous waveform complete with nonexisting overshoots I've
 waded through lots of manual pages and menus but I haven't found yet
 how to turn this off It doesn't show which points have actually
 been measured as opposed to those which have been interpolated
 either

Perhaps you're using the wrong brand Sorry all HP fans but I have
a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
excellent gear

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is
whether you can turn interpolation off The other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition ie being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode

 
 Secondly I don't like menus I want to see all common functions
 with their own button You'll have guessed I love analogue Tek
 scopes I'd choose a knob with printed legend over an onscreen
 display with updown buttons right away The single knob of most
 digital instruments never seems to be connected to the right function
 at the right moment
 

I agree with you here The only consolation is that manufacturers are
beginning to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus
However to be fair it seems that first time scope users our students
seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a real scope 

 Last but not least you never know if the waveform displayed is old
 or recent noisy or just incoherently modulated heck you don't
 even know if it really looks the way it's displayed Digital scopes
 only show you a tiny fraction of what's going on Most of the time
 the're busy computing things

This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing I recently evaluated
the latest box from Tek  their TDS  which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard MHz analogue CRO This instrument has
a MHz Mss spec meaning that it is always in real time
capture mode The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range The downer is that the instrument uses menus again but at
least they appear to be logically laid out
 
 There are only three situations for which I would prefer a digital
 scope Looking at what happened before the trigger looking at rare
 events and acquiring the data to have my computer play with it
 
 
 Let's hope scope manufacturers are listening
 
 Best regards
 Jeroen Belleman
 jeroendxcerncernch

One more thing about the new simpler front panels These instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now This is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch The single most common cause of failure in our
scopes other than students blowing up inputs is mechanical wear on these
switches I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments

 I have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design
 What I am looking for is a stable ultralong solid state timer What they want
 to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount
 of snow fall over a period of six weeks Every two weeks they want to trip a
 selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the
 snow Then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured
 as they come to the different color pellets
 
 The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold  degrees
 and a power source that wouldn't drain I have looked at the XR timers and
 the standard NE dual timers but thier temp specs won't go that low Also
 two weeks equates to  seconds per firing which means one big timing
 cap  I have found  farad yes Farad  caps that have a working voltage of
  volts and are small in size But again the time of discharge at  or lower
 degrees isn't linear I was thinking of using several timers chained together 
 to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and
 the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain One possibility would be to
 use solar panels but this is during the six month twilight Anyone have any
 good ideas 
 
 Thanks in advance
 
  Wes 

Firstly I would never consider trying to make a oneshot timer Your F cap
will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute rather than for use in
applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current Their
performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap
The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with  tolerances
so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering
the cold

You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain
that rolls over from zero to maximum count or viceversa once every
 seconds If you were to use something like a Hz clock you would
need a divider chain of  to give an error of less than one percent in the
firing times over the six week period Of course you could trim the Hz
oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator
remaining exactly constant at  is low anyway

I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the
solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit

Caveat  I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics so I can't
guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable
conditions

 I've started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission
 over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments and have
 seen a variety of schemes for protecting the RS transceivers and

From what I know protection is necessary esp if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment out of your control Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke Even ethernet cards are
protected I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube

But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings ie in
controlled environments it should be reasonably safe not to have
them

Suggestion look in the RS data book They have several RS
transceivers that have overvoltage protection Among them include the
LT LT and MAX and MAX The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need optoisolators to work don't
ask me why I've never used them before

Another alternative is an RS surge protector Two are listed in the
RS catalogue If you need additional info ie stock nos just email
me

Recently my video monitor went dead no picture some low distorted sound
I didn't hear the telltale cracking that indicated HV at work nor are the
filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange just nothing

On examining the power board I noticed the largest capacitor with a very
bad bulge at the top  Naturally I want to replace it but I can't find
any sources

The electrolytic capacitor is  mF at WV  It has radial leads and is
roughly   inches long   wide  The dimensions are important since
the whole board fits in a metal cage leaving little room

Living in the Los Angeles area I've been to numerous stores Dow Radio
All Electronics ITC Elect Sandy's Yale Elect with empty hands

Can anyone suggest sources for highvoltage capacitors  Mail order is 
fine although I'd rather check out a store to compare the can  I'm going
to try a video electronics store hopefully they'll have HV caps

By the way the monitor is a ATARI SC Goldstar circuitry Masushita

  I wouldn't expect any components other than batteries or electrolytic
 capacitors to fail at  C or  F for that matter either  
 The battery is going to be your big problem  Also of course your
 circuit shouldn't depend on exact values of resistors which a crystal
 controlled timer won't
 

 Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that as a
mechanically resonating device extreme cold is likely to affect the
compliance terminology of the quartz and hence its resonant frequency

The HC is an EPROM version of the HC Raw HC parts have factory set
ROM images and as such are useless to the hobbyist HC parts have
EEPROM allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming

Some Motorola parts such as the HCK have EPROM making them user
programmable but come with options of either windowed or sealed The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use the plastic dip
varieties are onetime programmable since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light

Bonjour Sylvain
	J'ai travaille avec le hc il y a  ans et je ne me souviens pas de toutes les possibilites mais je vais quand meme essayer de t'aider

	Je ne crois pas que downloader une programme directement dans le eeprom soit une bonne idee le eeprom a une duree de vie limitee a   cycles il me semble Le communication break down vient peutetre du fait que le eeprom est long a programmer ms par  bytes mais c'est a verifier et que les delais de transfer de programme s vers la memoire sont excedes Normalement les transferts en RAM du code s est plus rapide car le RAM est plus rapide que le eeprom en ecriture

	C'est tout ce que ma memoire me permet de me souvenir

Bonne chance

 After a considerable amount of research review of discussions 
 on this group and mainly fruitless time on breadboards I have 
 decided that the path of least resistance for prototyping my not 
 necessarily someone else's electronic designs is wire wrapping  

	I have no idea about what you want to do but be careful 
Wire wrapping increases a lot the wiring capacitance That shouldn't
be a problem for slow applications ie a few MHz but as for
quicker ones around    MHz I doubt that it can work


	Fortunately wirewrapping is a better wiring technique than
most at high frequencies Cray computers up to the XMP at least
all had wirewrapped backplanes  Wirewrap gets into trouble at
much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle  The 'increase'
of wiring capacitance is not really relevant you have to use
transmission line techniques and the capacitance is no problem

  Where can I get a decent wrapping tool  I'd like to spend less 
 than  for an AC powered unit including bit and sleeve

	Hand powered is the best There are good AC powered ones
but rather expensive A lowcost one doesn't work very well

	Handpowered is a terrible choice IMHO unless you are
a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections
at a time  Your hands will cramp  Batterypowered wirewrap guns
are available in the  range and so are the little
twiddlestick manual types   For a modest project of
a couple hundred connections I'd prefer to borrow a professional
AC unit or a pneumatic one

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game Dragon's Lair
Space Ace etc Call Pioneer Technicial Support  at least
that's the number I called them at and ask for the LDV Interface
Guide It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes

Yes I know it's nowhere near Christmas time but I'm gonna loose
Net access in a few days maybe a week or  if I'm lucky and wanted
to post this for interested people to save 'till Xmas   
Note Bell Labs is a good place IF you have a PhD and a good boss I
have neither


Subject Xmas light set with  levels of brightness

Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set
This set starts with a  blinker  bulb string  

DIAGRAM  orginal  way set

vb
       b
                           
rtn

modified set for  level brightness

                string 
v
  K
    w          string      
          b   
v rtn

              Note no mods to wiring to the right of this point

Only one blinker is used

Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the
string  bulbs because of the second string of bulbs in
parallel with it  That's why the use of the K W resistor
here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the
current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing
and the second string is not glowing  When the blinker goes open
this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the
strings s slightly dimmer s slightly brighter  
Or use a W v bulb in place of the K resistor if you can get
one  Caution do not replace with a standard C bulb as these
draw too much current and burn out the blinker  C  approx W

What you'll see when it's working  powerup string  will light 
at full brightness and b will be lit bypassing most of the current 
from the second string making them not light  b will open placing 
both strings in series making the string that was out to glow at a 
low brightness and the other string that was on before to glow 
at reduced brightness 

Be sure to wire and insulate the splices resistor leads and cut wires 
in a safe manner

 I am somewhat familiar with the dB measurements as they apply to  
 electrical circuits  ie it is the gain of for example an amplifier  
 measured on a logarithmic scale  However this requires that you have a  
 reference value  ie the ouput is dB eg with respect to the input  
 signal

stuff deleted

 What you actually talking about here is dBm and not dB  However the terms
 are used loosely by most people  dBm'' is power with respact to mW whereas
 dB is a ratio  Now like these two English statement

   I am doing well
   I am doing good
 
 Similarly people usually use dB for dBm Another common mistake is spelling
 db'' instead of dB'' as you did in your article See the B'' is for 
 Bell'' company the mother of ATT and should be capitalized
 
                           With highest regards
                                Babak   Sehari

Good gravy Decibels are all ratios The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used Sometimes this will be a reference
power such as  milliwatt given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known like  ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance leading to an accepted
notation of dBm Maybe it might be dBV disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed using  volt as reference amplitude
rather than reference power Or it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation leading to just plain dB
So look at it this way'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference

For power

  dB  log PmeasuredPreference 

For amplitude

  dB  log AmeasuredAreference 

'B' is for bel which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
 named after Alexander Graham Bell A 'deci' Bel is  of a bel
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name The small 'd'large 'B' is per SI notation
convention I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up

Common references for audio are

	 dBm   milliwatt across  ohms
	 dBV   volt

	 VU a zero on the VU meter   dBm  pro gear line level
	 VU  dBV	consumer gear line level


Often times a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the  dB point It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment

Note that in a circuit with a given and maybe unknown linear
impedance if the amplitude goes up so many decibels the
power will also increase the same amount This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law

I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
transformers as the material wouldn't damp as wellsomething
I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved in other

real difficult at  KHz

I believe that the AD converters found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an RC circuit the R being your
paddle to charge up to something like  Vcc  For games this works
pretty well but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab
measurements off something as nonlinear as that

Hmm I suppose you could linearize it in software but the real problem
is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant higher
voltages would be more precise

On the other hand I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers
splurged for the extra  to make a cheap constant current source out of
an op amp  But I wouldn't expect that

means of a transformer The secondary current will be  A  mA

What kind of transformer should I use ferrite
Can I buy one If so I need a partnumber and supplier
If I cannot buy one how do I go about winding one myself
What core do I use how big must it be in order not to saturate
what thickness copper wire how many turns etc

I know little about analog electronics so I hope some kind
soul here will help me out
Pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated

  Nope  The dag is on the outside of the tube and is grounded  The inside
  aluminization is the second anode and is connected to the 'anode'
  suction cup  This with the glass of the tube in between is a capacitor
  and is used as the power supply bypassfilter for the HV supply  Some
  smaller scope tubes don't have an aquadag coating on the outside  If they
  are in mumetal shields you still have a capacitor
 
 Actually and I think I said this in the original but perhaps wasn't clear
 enough there is usually both an internal AND an external dag  Of the two
 the internal dag is the more important the aluminization of the back of the
 phosphor is in most cases not adequate to guarantee connection to the anode
 button and in the case where the gun assembly includes an accelerating
 electrode at anode potential most definitely does not provide THAT 
 connection

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating is referred to as a
dag as well as the outer coating

Thankfully I didn't need to go to a f library to find it either

  I am looking for any info I can get on the NEC D monitor
  I know that it is a multisync but that is about all
  I plan on buying one secondhand in a while depending on its specs
  
  Does anyone know the minmax frequencies whether it is interlaced 
  noninterlaced or both video compatability etc
  I have seen a reference to it being  pitch with  X  resolution 
  and that it supports SVGA from one source and that it doesn't support 
  SVGA from another source  Neither source seemed to have much reliable 
  info so I don't want to take a guess
 
 I'm at home right now and so am away from my monitor files the following
 is off the top of my head subject to revision worthwhatyapayforit
 sort of info  If you don't hear from anyone who has spec sheet in hand
 email me and I'll look it up
 
 If I'm remembering correctly the D is a   mm pitch multisync that
 covers at least VGA  kHz horizontal  Hz vertical to  x  
  Hz which is going to be about  kHz horizontal  It may go somewhat
 higher than that on the horizontal but you won't be happy with anything
 beyond  x  on a   tube you probably won't be too thrilled
 with the  x  on this tube but it will sync up and display it
 I prefer at least a   for this resolution  Since SVGA is x
 it'll do that too  The horizontal range probably goes lower than  but
 I don't know if it goes all the way down to straight NTSCrate TV which need
 about  kHz sweep  As far as video compatibility if I'm reading
 the question right it won't take anything but analog RGB inputs  In other
 words it has no way to decode NTSC or YC video inputs  You would need
 some sort of board to to this conversion  like the sorts of things that 
 let you display NTSC on a VGA display
 
 Hopefully now I'll see this response of mine and it'll remind me to
 look this stuff up and confirm it  Or force me to post a hasty retraction

Ok I was under the impression that it accepted digital input

I still don't know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and 
noninterlaced as I have gotten conflicting info

From what I have read about these little gadgets it works on
a electrochemical galvanic principle The sensing unit has a
chemical matrix which produces an electrical voltage proportional
to the amount of chemical compound it is designed for  in this case
I believe it is the Hydroxyl group  

I have also heard   not tested    since common gasoline is also
a member of this Hydroxyl group it will also cause a failing breathalizer
failure Next time you get stopped for DUI say you just siphoned gas from

 Instead use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by   times

Yes but in a fairly reproducible way  is only a smidgen of the

 Similarly people usually use dB for dBm Another common mistake is spelling
 db'' instead of dB'' as you did in your article See the B'' is for 
 Bell'' company the mother of ATT and should be capitalized
 
 Thus a deciBell deci l tenth of  Bell is a fractional part of the 
 original Bell  For example SouthWestern Bell is a deciBell

Out of what hat did you pull this one  dB is a ratio not an RBOC        

 And the measure of current Amp is actually named after both the AMP company
 and the Amphenol company  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
 simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
 were affected by the amount of current running through the wires

Sorry  The unit for current is the AMPERE which is the name of a frenchman
named AMPERE who studied electrical current  The term AMP is just an abbreviation
of it  The company AMP came after the AMPERE unit was already in use
  
 The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus
 our use of the Ohms

I don't know about this one but it doesn't sound right

  Question 
  
  	If I am right about the dopplerif I spell it different every time
  maybe one will be right effect how does the radar get an accurate reading
  when the car containing it is moving  It would seem to me  for all thats
  worth that it would need to be calibrated with the speedometer of the car
  containing it  I am fairly sure this isn't the case so whats the deal
 
 Essentially this is actually how it is done  The radar gun is tied into
 the speedometer of the car

No it is independent of the speedometer The gun processes two doppler
returnsthe speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed
of the target taking the difference between the two Some guns with
a moving mode actually have a split beam with one beam aimed
preferentially at the pavement

Car and Driver had a good article on traffic radar but it was back in
 I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus
radarmeasured ticket It detailed moving mode which is easier to
defend against because of the increased amount of variables

  Currently the XNF format is propierty and I know of at least on person at
a university who was able to get it after signing a nondisclosure agreement
The Xilinxbit map format is pretty well top secret  I would love to know it
because then you could make selfmodifyinghardware    As it is I had to
reverse eng the Xilinx tools to dump the bit map to the FPGA because it only
runs on the computer with the hardware key

selfmodifying hardware could be very interesting 
 computers that could write thier own programs assemblers compilers
were an immense breakthrough from calculators that couldn't

  I eagerly await a programmable gate array which uses a PD format and does
not cost your first born to program  Till then we will keep on reverse
engineering whatever we can  As it is one company that I worked at has gone
under  FPGAs are what they needed to make their product competitive  They
could not afford them  In the end you could say that they could not afford
to not use them but the management discovered that too late 
    Eric 

my condolences

i can't even imagine what i could do with selfmodifing hardware
i can imagine selfmodifying software
and even though all my teachers say that's BAD even Worse than GOTO
check out what the experts used to say about selfmodifying code
he uses orders rather than opcodes


On the Principles of Large Scale Computing Machines
by Goldstine and von Neumann
collected in 
John von Neumann Collected Works Vol V
reprinted here with absolutely no permission from anyone
We plan to have a full size  binary digit word hold
either contain
 full size number  equivalent to  decimal digits
but we will use the first binary digit to denote the sign
or two  binary digit orders

	It should be added that this technique of
automatic substitutions into orders
ie the machine's ability to modify its own orders
under the control of other ones among its orders
is absolutely necessary for a flexible code Thus if
part of the memory is used as a function table then
looking up a value of that function for a value of the 
variable which is obtained in the course of the computation
requires that the machine itself should modify or
rather make up the reference to the memory in the order which
controls this looking up and the machine can only make this
modification after it has already calculated the value of the 
variable in question
	On the other hand this ability of the machine to modify its
own orders is one of the things which makes coding
the nontrivial operation which we have to view it as

I have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design
What I am looking for is a stable ultralong solid state timer What they want
to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount
of snow fall over a period of six weeks Every two weeks they want to trip a
selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the
snow Then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured
as they come to the different color pellets

The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold  degrees
and a power source that wouldn't drain I have looked at the XR timers and
the standard NE dual timers but thier temp specs won't go that low Also
two weeks equates to  seconds per firing which means one big timing
cap  I have found  farad yes Farad  caps that have a working voltage of
 volts and are small in size 

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job  A single chip
micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily  An  only
costs about   That and a  crystal and you're in business  Embed
the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket power it from a solar cell
use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely
on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness  If you don't want
to try thermal management contact someone like ICL and have them cut
you a special low temperature crystal  It'll cost at most 

If you use a single chip micro you're looking at a parts count of 
maybe   A processor a crystal two caps on the crystal a power FET
to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery  This is fewer parts than 
you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable  Add
a power zener diode for heat and a solar cell and the parts count
screams up to 

PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros  This
application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the 
programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor

Hi

   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diodecapacitor
voltage multiplier to step the vAC supply voltage up to approx 
vDV As the load resistance increases the RC constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops I need as high an output
voltage as possible about v
  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
ie  diodes and  capacitors each capacitor develops about v
across them and I take the output from across seven capacitorsv
  Each capacitor is mfd at v
 If I increase each of the capacitors rating mfd that will
increase the RC constant and hence alleviate some of the problem
These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need  of
them So

 What would happen if I connected a mfd at v capacitor in parallel 
with the output and hence in parallel with the seven mfd capacitors
  Will it as I assume increase the C in circuit and hence increase
the RC time constant If it does and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this then I will have killed two birds with one stone
as I am experiencing some Hz ripple and hence amp hum and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out

and
 Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the Hz mains hum Lowest resistance possible 

  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH
of a distraction I'm at university and I've got to get my 
dissertation finished in two weeks  hence I'm mailing not
playing with my solderoing iron it'll be cheaper too in the long
run especially if  new large capacitors don't work as planned

Email please Can't always read the net

Thanks in advance

I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate
some netwisdom

His question is about some  diameter balls which are attached to
electric power lines in his area  He's seen up to a half dozen between
two poles  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution
My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
inductance of the grid but why so many between two poles

Anyone know what they really are  Is there a related FAQ for this
Is there a better group to submit to

We'd both appreciate some enlightenment


 The balls are used to reduce the amplitude of oscillations of the wire during
periods of high winds  I've seen what looks like paint cans filled with
concrete used for the same purpose

 Can someone out there explain exactly what the 'trigger'
 feature found on oscilloscopes does
 
 	 lots og good explanation deleted

lots more deleted
 	Is it just me or does anybody else out there NOT like digital
 scopes My school has some beauutful Mhz HP that are digital with
 all the bells and whistles including softkeys which I think are a
 loveley touch  that is software keys  You don't forget that you
 are dealing with a computer Those scopes even with all their
 neatness still make the ickyest looking waves Lotsa features but
 ugly output And those are the best digitals I have ever seen I've
 seen a lot of cheaper digitals and they look terrible

I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much
more about them and how they work on a scopebyscope basis and
some of the functions are typically presented in my opinion
in a counterintuitive fashion HP has made some strides in their
 series IMO Automatic setups are fine for simple
repetitive waveforms but can give you some crazy results on more
complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
actually measuringprocessing the event For example is the scope
in equivalent time or in real time sampling mode equivalent time
being a mode where samples are builtup slowly by adding a delay to
the trigger event each sweep What was the scope's actual sampling
rate at the time How is the data being massaged after capture but
before display etc One common misconception is the speed of the scope

Is the HP scope you're using really a  MHz scope Or is it a  MHz
sample rate scope  MHz single shot significance whose front
end including SH can support  MHz waveforms important for
equivalent time sampling The  MHz input in this case really
only helps you when your waveform is repetitive or on a single
sample when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time

So there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
useful information from a digital scope I prefer an analog scope for
general use and the digital for events where I need storage for
later analysis or comparison when the event is within the capability
of the scope Now for the price of true  MHz digital scopes to
fall

Strictly defined a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels

Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal period  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
even if it is not on is   Sorry tourist ignorance of
the law is no excuse  they will get you too

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector  Not any more  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors 
Right a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself  My first reaction was no way 
But guess again these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one
and he could never figure out where it was  but he knew it was
there  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest

Now before I get flamed please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket  But I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia which
is what they want  and yes what the law says and I intend to
obey the law and is only used in states where it is legal

For my fellow hams I am not a microwave person  my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between  and  meters  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary

So the questions are 
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect
  Would additional shieldinggroundingbypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna
  Are any brands quieter than others

 telephone systems have the capability of a passband of hz to Khz
 The reason they do not implement this is It is not backward compatable
 to every telephone system  In addition the most effecent mix of 
 electrical effecency and intelegability closly mateches a hzkhz
 passband

Close but no banana to paraphrase Garfield
The reason  Hz is used is that voice channels used to occupy
kHz bands when multiplexed on a trunk line Therefore Hz at the
bottom and Hz at the top of this band were filtered to minimise
interference with the next band

Nowadays digital trunks have made this less relevant but the phone
companies still see no reason to improve quality especially for free
Therefore digital chunk of a trunk segments still have a guaranteed
bandwidth of only kHz so they can carry the equivalent of one analog
line at the clock rate of a standard PCM T or E digital trunk

It's all historical


Here in the UK the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines ie those used by the average domestic client Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital

Don't quote me on that But I think I remember a BT engineer 
saying something to that effect when I was doing some work
shadowing a few years ago

Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when
an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zerocrossing of
the AC cycle  A capacitor kludged in somehow etc

I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps
in a big instrument washer and almost everything is being switched with
zerocrossing solid state relays so that stuff stays quiet ACwise
But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay
in the water tank fillthermostat system and it's not under control
of my SSRs and it does sometimes generateradiate a spike that resets
one of my peripheral chips  My software times out and tries again but
I'd love to just tack in a magic spikekilling fix that would avoid having
to do some major rewiringredesign  A varistor would help but might not
be sufficient  Ideas

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car

 I might add that collecting last year's data books or even ones two years out
 of date is usually pretty cheap and has benefits besides  You usually DON'T
 want to base a design on a brandnew chip  There may be bugs availability may
 be limited the data sheets may be missing critical information that will show
 up in the ap notes in next year's data books  Kinda like buying Version  of
 a major new software package  Sometimes you get lucky but don't count on it

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
yearsobsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials

When a part is dropped from future production planning such as the
National MMseries white noise generators camera sync generators etc
it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
for a short time or be available from stock somewhere Now if you
have some old plans calling for such a device or you have a dead
gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it you'll know
the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary

The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere for
example

  In summary read READ READ That's how you'll know what to
  design in which parts to use and how to solve the intractable problem
  that your boss has presented you with 
 
 It helps to have a prodigous memory for details

	If you know much about PC's IBM comp you might try the joystick
port  Though I haven't tried this myself I've been told that the port

I believe that the AD converters found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an RC circuit the R being your
paddle to charge up to something like  Vcc  For games this works
pretty well but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab
measurements off something as nonlinear as that

The best info I have seen so far is the article Joystick Metrics
Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port by
Michael Covington in the May  issue of PC Tech Journal  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things voltage current resistance in
BASIC and even includes code for a simple oscilloscope display

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr Dobb's Circuit Cellar Ink
etc  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive

Good Luck

I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I
came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling
components  For those who have not heard of this effect you put a
current through one of these devices and it pumps heat from one side
to the other  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect  I
think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well

Anyway it struck me that you could make a nice coolhot box for
picnics with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks  The biggest device can shift W with an
efficiency of  which ain't bad although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour

Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump  I imagine that you would get a backEMF as the
temperature gradient across the device increases  If so presumably
its power decreases as the backEMF increases until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed assuming no
leakage  If so then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
although that would be a lousy way to control it

What I would like to know is

 Are the above guesses correct

 What is the opencircuit thermal resistance of a typical device
   I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm
   too fast when I unplug it

 How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work  It looks like
   magic

 Why don't they use these things in domestic fridgesfreezers


Thanks in advance

 I'm interested in buying or building an omnidirectional antenna for the

 either of these designs as exhibiting any gain and they probably aren't 
 truely omnidirectional
 
 
 I'm intrigued by the discone antenna  Does anyone have detailed information
 on how to design one for the FM band with ohm impedence  Is one

 I already own a element FM yagi  It works great but requires frequent

   For an antenna gain is synonymous with directionality  The only way 
to get gain  out of an antenna is to design in directionality The 
gain of an antenna is defined as the signal increase for a preferred 
direction over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna

I have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design
What I am looking for is a stable ultralong solid state timer What they want
to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount
of snow fall over a period of six weeks Every two weeks they want to trip a
selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the
snow Then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured
as they come to the different color pellets

The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold  degrees
and a power source that wouldn't drain I have looked at the XR timers and
the standard NE dual timers but thier temp specs won't go that low Also
two weeks equates to  seconds per firing which means one big timing
cap  I have found  farad yes Farad  caps that have a working voltage of
 volts and are small in size But again the time of discharge at  or lower
degrees isn't linear I was thinking of using several timers chained together
to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and
the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain One possibility would be to
use solar panels but this is during the six month twilight Anyone have any
good ideas 

Thanks in advance

 Wes 

just a suggestion
take a motorola mcB set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
secs with either a RC or xtal clock input then feed to a MCB as clock
input and decode output for  sec output might have to add a few 'and'
gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the' to restart
cycle Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge the one shot then
goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher
these ckts require uAmps of currentbetween    volts so a  volt
gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks
Then take the ckt board  battery wrap in  or  of foam or build a box
of out of the stuffwith plywood or metal exterior
build a small heater out of  Watt resistors in series to keep the battery
and ckts warm
nd thought use  batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger

Insolateinsolateeven though the chips state that the  AL
rated devices are good to  C The batteries have a considerable reduction
in capacityoh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage

hope this helps

His question is about some  diameter balls which are attached to
electric power lines in his area  He's seen up to a half dozen between
two poles  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution
My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
inductance of the grid but why so many between two poles

Anyone know what they really are  Is there a related FAQ for this
Is there a better group to submit to

We'd both appreciate some enlightenment

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car  


Unfortunately you're wrong on both counts  The most common method of
implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator  The
local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via
the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great
care

For a reference on detecting radios get the paperback book Spy Catcher
The author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local
oscillator emissions back in the s while he worked for British
Intelligence

What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps 

March ' Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about
dimming VAC lamps but it seems to lead into phase
control as the best method for controlling brightness
  I've always hated phasecontrol for the RFI buzzing
filaments and nonlinear adjustment range I had
heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by
cycle basis to get better results To cut the lamp's
power to  you would givemsay  cycles of AC then
nothing for another  cycles I wonder if anyone has
tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using Any
advice is appreciated

Might anyone be able to point me to references to such

nicely to be used for thermocouples say a few degrees

 I've been following this thread about jacob's ladder for a few weeks and I
happened to come across one of the best project books that I've seen in a 
while  The book Gadgeteer's Goldmine by Gordon McComb offers over  
excellent low cost projects including Jacob's Ladder tesla coils plasma 
spheres a Van de Graaff generator robots an IR scope and several laser 
projects  The instructions come with complete part lists warnings and 
diagrams  For those of you who are interested in building any of the above 
listed projects you should seriously consider getting this book  The 
paperback version is only  too

 How was this testing done and how many times  Calibrated speedometer

 It's not the some cases that worry me it's the other cases

situation sometimes called block sync  You can generate such a combined
or composite sync in two simple ways  OR the H and V syncs together
which gives you the nonserrated block sync or EXOR them which makes
serrations  Try it  Actually the EXOR doesn't really do kosher serrated
sync since it puts the rising and falling for that matter edge of the H 
sync pulse off by a pulse width  But that usually makes no difference

Sometimes  It depends on your monitor and your timing  If you don't
have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can
get evenodd tearing at the top of the screen which is very sensitive
to the HHOLD control  It looks like what you would expect if you
scanned the even fields say onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the
upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube 
With proper composite sync equalizing pulses the interlace is rock
solid

 I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate
 some netwisdom
 
 His question is about some  diameter balls which are attached to
 electric power lines in his area  He's seen up to a half dozen between
 two poles  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution
 My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
 inductance of the grid but why so many between two poles
I'll bet there's a runway nearby

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car  
 
From my rather rusty knowledge of radio most radio receivers use a superhet 
circuit so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator giving 
a fixed intermediate frequency IF that is more easily amplified The
detector detectors work by picking up IF reradiated from your radar 
detector In Britain where one hasused to pay for a TV licence there 
arewere TV detector vans prowling the streets looking for people who hadn't 
paid their licence fee They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the
roof and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF 

I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna and 
how much from the rest of the module It might be worth putting the detector 
in a proper RF shielded enclosure

 one of our production coordinators for out information so that we could
 make plans to deal with this that Moto was getting out  Anybody else
 get a call about this
 
 Too much for me  It's about like Intel announcing they were getting out
 of the IC business


This rumor didn't happen to appear on April st

If this DigiKey rep was serious I think I will buy my parts elsewhere
If that is the way they do business you cannot trust them

Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there

  I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for   it is a 
little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal Then
I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED The circuit works
like a minature remote control extender in my car  All remote commands are
relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment It works fine with
my Denon CD player but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's
VCR it didn't work
  The circuit appears to work for other remotes you can see infrared with a
Sony CCD camcorder but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD
player

	Any advice would be appreciated

I agree  I come at this from nuclear physics where one often discusses 
particlehole excitations and certain reactions have the effect of 
applying an annihilation operator and creating a hole and it is a 
subtle question  The longer one works with them the more real they 
become  There are also quasiparticles which raise the same sort 
of question about how real the entity is  The phenomenon is most 
certainly a real one 

OK I've asked this before and with a new thread on these lines I
ask this again

 If a large hole current is run thru a resistor will there be
   I  R cooling instead of heating

 Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents

 what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory Also
   don't be limited to semiconductors consider also insulators
   resistors dielectrics piezoelectrics conductors
   magnets metal ceramic magnetostrictives etc

NOTES

   to summarize this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum That is hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semiconductors The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semiconductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor say copper
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents if they exist
   Also note that I have crossposted this to scielectronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion

Thanx

As for Adcoms Mobil They are going with amps that canb use Balanced Inputs a
VERY nice toy but I'm afraid its goig to push their amps beyound resonable
price ranges  especialy because taking advantage of those balanced inputs
requires a  RCA to Balanced adapter

Umm when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living I used to get direct boxes which convert
unbalanced  jacks to balanced XLRs for about  each or a little more for higher
quality You'll need two for a stereo signal of course and a little adapter thingy from 
Radio Sht to convert from RCA to  Total cost should be around  You can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself Total cost there should be under 
You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear
The benefit NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs even when you run them in bad places like next to power lines

  Just a thought of mine here
  Since an onhook line is aprox V and offhook it usually drops below 
  How about an LED in series with a zener say around V
  Onhook  LED on
  Offhook  LED off
  Would this work If anyone triestried it please let me know
 
  Aye there's the rub  if you draw enough current to light an LED the
  equipment at the phone company will think you've gone off hook
  In the onhook state you're not supposed to draw current
 
 Which means you should just use your Digital VoltMeter You can use an
 old VOM but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think
 there's something wrong with the cable
 
 
 Look Guys what's the problem here  If you want a light that goes on when 
 the 'phone is Off hook all you need it to run it in series with the 
 line as I mentioned in my previous post  If you want a light that goes on 
 when the 'phone is on hook all you need is a voltage threshold detector

If you're going to do the series Diode thing which is the easiest just
make sure that the LED can take the current I can't recall it offhand but
it's something like mA or more

	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in After having it awhile
I noticed two things about the function generator For one there
seems to be a bias even when the 'pulloffset' is pushed in That is
I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
random mV bias
	The other really annoying thing is that the damn output
won't go below about V pp I am a student  you may have guessed
from my previous posts  and I often have to measure the input
impedances of various circuits I buildMany of the circuits have
maximum input signals of way less than mV amplitude and most have
input impedances in the 's of Kohm range The thing is in order to
use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing
reasonable Then of course to measurethe input impedance of my
circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series
With the ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it but now
with this little divider there I have to figure that in It's kind of
a pain in  the ass
	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem The box would tkae the function generator
input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low unchanging number I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so I could just build a little buffer amp but I'd
like to have this box not be active
	Any quick ideas The scope's not broken For other reasons I
had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it The
function generator was the same way on that one too

look much like what you describe but they include a UHF whip antenna less
than a foot tall and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that 
an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching  Local folklore 
says this system was invented here I don't know if this company has any

Just a shot here but ya never know

I once bought a REAL cheap equalizer  power amp for my car tape player 
at one of those motelroom truckload sales and it sounded great  For a 
while that is  Then one channel quit entirely  I opened it up and the 
amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
joints attaching it to the PCB  I soldered them back and it worked fine  
I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before  Probably 
lousy heat sinking

You said a nice Alpine which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher
in quality than the POS I had  But the point is  look inside before
you scrap it since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair
Maybe even the same thing I found

Good luck

I'm no expert at UPS's but you said something that made it sound like
you didn't realize something  On a typical UPS well on ours anyway
there is NO switchover from AC to DC  All the protected equipment is
ALWAYS running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge  If the power fails big deal  
the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but 
there's something like  carsized batteries in that cabinet so it 
takes a while

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter
why not do it all the time  Then there'd be no switchover to screw
things up and no having to sense the failure fast  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on and it'll be there in zero time when
you need it

Just some ideas  Can't guarantee what'll work or not but hope at least
SOME of this helped

I had a GE Emerson  color TV for about  years and one fine day
while we were watching something I doubt if the program was the cause
we heard a mild explosion   Our screen went blank but there was sound
so we thought 'oh we have special effects on the program'  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV
The brilliant EEs we are we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold I will transfer u to blah blah
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
we wanted a bigger one too
 After all the story what I wanted to know is Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding but
not here in the US Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke
 I still have the left over TV set I might dig into it this summer Any
idea where I can get parts for these things probably will cost more than TV

 It seems reasonable to me that a microwave transmitterreceiver setup could 
 do the job For example say you want to map an acre lot it'd be convenient
 to place MW transmitters around the lot's periphery either  or  and then
 carry a handheld recorder and walk to a point on the lot press a button and
 the coords of the recorder's location is stored as digital data
 
 What's the chance of this working Any systems like this already exist
 What kind of accuracy could you expect What would something like this
 cost to prototype Is there a better alternative than microwaves

Of course you could develope this system but there is already a system called Global
Positioning Satellites  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth 
Many surveyors use this system with a differential receivertransmitter to get
coordinates within centimeters  Basic receivers with resolution of a few meters on
a good day are available from many sources

 Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X  module by putting it 
before the transformer It seems to work even the dimmer works Not very 
reliable Will it damage the module Can it be done reliably

 I put a motion switch Heath to a low voltage light it worked but now it is
broken too much current How can I get arround that 
  
 How can I increase the intensity of a light using the X PC computer
interface without having it go  on first and then down I am doing
my own programing not the X program

Thanks   C Montenegro

	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in

Hmm now where was that ad for the combination radiohand cranked
generatorflashlightsiren I saw 

function generator has a mV offset and the amplitude's too high

	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem The box would tkae the function generator
input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low unchanging number I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so I could just build a little buffer amp but I'd
like to have this box not be active

Sure you've already got the right idea

Ignoring the  ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just
run it into say a voltage divider made of  ohms in series with 
ohms  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
 of the original voltage and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than  ohms  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the exact dividing ratio or
the availability of parts

Hows that sound

					Joel Kolstad

PS  This is why those  high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap  They have something like  megs in series with
k which doesn't load the often high impedence source much as well as
keeping the probably  meg impedance multimeter happy

I'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct
Input boxes for the keyboards  These are the little boxes that take a
line level out of the keyboard and transform it into lowZ for the run
to the mixer  Sadly they cost like  or more each and I'm going
to need like  or  of them  I looked inside one belonging to
another band and it looks like just a transformer  Does anyone have
any plans for building them  Perhaps in Anderton's Electronic
Projects for Musicians book which I am having a hell of a time
tracking down

Thanks a lot

	instead of using a vdc supply for the  try using a  and

for ground referenced audio  they use the  volt supply as the logic
ground

In this case would the switch control voltages be V to turn the switch
off and V to turn the switch on

  I'm considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and
  I need a little advice on outlet wiring  Several outlets
  are the old 'two prong' type without the ground  Naturally
  the wire feeding these outlets is  WITHOUT the ground
  wire  I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the
   with ground and that on these circuits the ground
  wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire

 This is contrary to the electrical code and should be fixed

Well my house was built just last year and the breaker box is wired the
same way  

	There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground
in the breaker box  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL
wire to a ground in the breaker box  There should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs ie not in
any of the outlet boxes

	The NEUTRAL white wire is a 'grounding conductor' for
the plug and is NOT safe to touch while the GROUND green
wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred  It's safe
to touch the protective ground but not to touch the 
grounding conductor because there is current in the grounding
conductor its outletbox end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breakerbox end

digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference

The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me

A gram of this dye costs a dollar
It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar
And if you want a whole barrel of it that also costs a dollar

Ie they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
it to you  the chemical itself in that particular case was a byproduct
that cost almost nothing intrinsically

was under the warrenty   Anyway the odometer was reading the exact milage
from the old panel It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is updated
Seems to me that removing the battery would erase it but it doesn't So I
guess they swapped the NVM chip nonvolitile memory and installed it in the
new dash No they wouldn't let me have the old dash to tinker with

I'm wanting to build a simple UPS for my PC  sustain the computer long enough to complete 
the current task and save  to  minutes should be enough
I think though I don't really need to keep the monitor active I can try to 
remember what to do so maybe I can avoid a DCAC inverter and just use a 
battery to directly supply the motherboard and peripherals

Now there's a good idea  All you need is  amps DC for a few minutes and
a good wetware memory was I using wp or autocad or  I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago I've got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my x when I go camping and it sits around useless when I'm home
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with or use it with a heavy
duty volt regulator to supply the PC But I guess you'd need v and v 
and  too  more batteries 

An alternative would be to leave a  AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a vdc to vac converter running all the time and when the power
goes out voila  the vac converter keeps on running off the battery  and
then I could take the vac converter and my computer on the camping trips

I'm looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good lownoise characteristics  large clean gain and incorportates phantom power  volts dc for a PZM microphone  I'm leaning towards a good lowcost  instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone for its good CMRR internal compensation and because i can use a minimal  of parts  

Does anyone out there have any experience suggestions advice etcthat they'd like to pass on I'd greatly appreciate it

Initial symptoms

Discovered when hooked up the scope
IF strip is not putting out audio or video signals
everything is making simple  Hz pulses
horiz out transistor collector case of the TO is a  Hz downgoing
  sawtooth with ca kHz ring at front end

guys WHATS GOING ON HERE  Anyone seen this before

What is happening is this
 You turn the TV on
 The horizontal output begins normal operation  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry
 A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down
 After it powers down the cycle repeats

Things to check
First check for a shorted high power component  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistors or if there is one the voltage regulator  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere
Also look for shutdown circuits which your TV may or may not have
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there

anyone know of any good supplier's of chips one that could have almost
any chip i need I don't want to hunt down all the chips I may need so
it would be greatly appreciated if anyone knows of a good distributor

thankyou


Paul

Unfortunately there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell like standard DRAM's 's 's etcetc
ie  I cna't think of any 'onestopshopping' store

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar Popular Electronics and the like and flip
through them

Distributors like Wyle Electronics Hamilton Avnet Pioneer Electronics
etc etc don't normally deal with endusers like ourselves where
we only a couple of everythingthey only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different noncompeting manufacturers  What do I mean by this
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 's  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 's or viceversa
They also can obtain just about any chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent

Who knows  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them
But I'd be suprised if you do  ALso bear in mind that the  or 
qty prices they will charge you will be much greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge

My advice  If you're gonna be designing anything try to stick
with offtheshelf stuff  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later

good luck

Attention hardware hackers and bargain seekers

I just bought a x pixel LCD panel for  UK pounds  I have
a datasheet for a similar panel but I'm looking for proper data

If anyone can help with locating data for this device before I start
with the routine on the phone to Hitachi and rummaging through the
library then I'll pass on the source

	Type LM Hitachi
	Resolution W x H so can do x chars on x matrix

Bought from

	Greenweld Electronics Ltd
	 Park Rd
	Southampton SO TB UK

	Tel     
	Fax     
	Email Compuserve 

NB I only just bought this  I don't even know if it works

	Price was  UK pounds including VAT  which isn't
	payable if you're outside the EC

Thanks for any info


Chris

I think the EPA was worried about all those batteries being dumped out

Pardon me but why would carbonzinc cells have any lead in them at all

I understand the need for a ground plane in a digital system However I
would like to know if such a ground plane is also necessary in an analog
system

Note this ground plane will not be connected except at one point to
the signal ground

I keep getting conflicting answers over this Does having a ground plane
in an analog system help reduce noise also My system only deals with
low frequency signals up to Hz only

Well one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on
what you want the ground plane to do  A continuous conductor is a good 
electrostatic shield  Do you have signals on your board that need
shielding rom other things  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic
fields unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded
like a Faraday cage

The flip side of the coin  if you are working with very high impedances
you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems
You aren't likely to encounter this at Hz but at kHz it can be a
real problem one that bit me once

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine I have ordered a PIC ICE not vice versa since the PICs are so 
cheap and lowpower but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the  digit range that are priced as low as I need  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of  in quantities of about 


Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a  digit LCD  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is  in 
quantity

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for  meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for  and the wholesaler probably gets it for  or so  This 
 includes assembly labor packaging sales transportation 
import duties the case and keyboard the PC Board the processor 
chip the solar cell  and the LCD  The LCD can't cost much

If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers andor 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged

PS  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled  Has anyone else

However it doesn't work with my Sony Walkman cassette player or the CD drive
it produces of loud lowfrequency tone Obviously Sony doesn't ground

I've got two lines coming into my apartment Two different telephone numbers
When I ordered the second line installed instead of bringing out another 
wire bundle the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires So I
have one line on red  green and the other on yellow  black

Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines I had a voltmeter across
the red and green and read back  volts I then lifted up the receiver on my
second lineblack  yellow wires The voltage dropped to  volts on the first
line red  green wires I repeated this experiment with the second
linemonitoring black  yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the
red and green line It also dropped to  volts 

Why is this  I thought these were separate lines

Next I went to the  block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in
from the telco cable I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and
went back to the  block and did some resistance measurements Both lines read
open

I'll appreciate any help on this Is this considered normal

That's scary  if there's a way to set an arbitrary mileage figure
into the odometer you can't trust any odometer reading even
if you can prove that the odometer itself is the same one that
came on the car originally

  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these
electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage  What kind of
memory is stablereliable enough nonvolatile enough and independent enough
of outside battery power to last say  years or more in the life of a
vehicle  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for
this length of time especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that
are doing good to work for  months without breaking down somehow

Side question  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with
a replaced odometer that starts over at  miles after say K
actual miles  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy  for the price of a
new odometer you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the
buyer it has

Thanks for any insight

Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum  This would cause the filament
to ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressure
vessel followed by an explosion when the neck assembly mostly likely
cracked to begin with blows off  During the whole sequence of events
the other circuits may continue functioning which accounts for not
losing sound

I do NOT know much about Adcom Mobil Audio products but I DO know for a fact
that ADCOM does NOT make its own High End Home Audio Equptment and that 
of it comes directly out of Tiawan

Like most highvolume manufacturers Adcom has most of its PC boards
assembled offshore in their case mostly in the far east  Final
assembly and testing are done in East Brunswick

The products are and have always been designed entirely in the US
by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung  Adcom
also tends to prefer American and European components over their
JapaneseFar East equivalents

Offshore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van

Of course if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock you might
prefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer

  Just a thought of mine here
  Since an onhook line is aprox V and offhook it usually drops below 
  How about an LED in series with a zener say around V
  Onhook  LED on
  Offhook  LED off
  Would this work If anyone triestried it please let me know
 
  Aye there's the rub  if you draw enough current to light an LED the
  equipment at the phone company will think you've gone off hook
  In the onhook state you're not supposed to draw current
 
 Which means you should just use your Digital VoltMeter You can use an
 old VOM but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think
 there's something wrong with the cable
 
 
 Look Guys what's the problem here  If you want a light that goes on when 
 the 'phone is Off hook all you need it to run it in series with the 
 line as I mentioned in my previous post  If you want a light that goes on 
 when the 'phone is on hook all you need is a voltage threshold detector

If you're going to do the series Diode thing which is the easiest just
make sure that the LED can take the current I can't recall it offhand but
it's something like mA or more

Careful now folks Also consider the VAC Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup you might end up with some carbon real quick  Whatever
scheme you use make sure you've got at least Vrated components on 
the frontend

Also remember that if I'm not mistaken the phone line is a ohm
equivalent circuit  Any current you draw from the V or so gets
dropped across that ohms  That's fine until you're down to roughly
V when Ma Bell considers it to be offhook  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big nono

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above

    tip  
              rectifier  resistor            
              diode                           
                                   V          
                          zener            resistor
                                             
                                             
                                             V   LED
                                            
                                             
    ring 

This is only a suggestiongo ahead and blow holes in it but you
get the idea  Choose a highefficiency LED so you don't need much
current to get it to light up  Choose values for the other components
as required

I'm no expert at UPS's but you said something that made it sound like
you didn't realize something  On a typical UPS well on ours anyway
there is NO switchover from AC to DC  All the protected equipment is
ALWAYS running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge  If the power fails big deal  
the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but 
there's something like  carsized batteries in that cabinet so it 
takes a while

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter
why not do it all the time  Then there'd be no switchover to screw
things up and no having to sense the failure fast  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on and it'll be there in zero time when
you need it


Actually it's a bit more complicated than thatI sounds to me
your UPS takes in AC rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries and
then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again feeding your
equipment  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to
switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since
as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line

Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you
lose power and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to
replace the lost power  The problem here is the switchover time and
you've got to resync the AC in no time flat

Unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that
AC is available so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to
be usableya sorta have to make it work with what there already

Similar story with our telephone system  It was first invented back
in the 's  We're still using the same damn system media as they
did back then  If I have a phone from back then I can assure you
it'll work on today's phone system  It costs too much to overhaul
everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there

I had a GE Emerson  color TV for about  years and one fine day
while we were watching something I doubt if the program was the cause
we heard a mild explosion   Our screen went blank but there was sound
so we thought 'oh we have special effects on the program'  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV
The brilliant EEs we are we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold I will transfer u to blah blah
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
we wanted a bigger one too
 After all the story what I wanted to know is Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding but
not here in the US Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke
 I still have the left over TV set I might dig into it this summer Any
idea where I can get parts for these things probably will cost more than TV


Heh heh heh hehI laugh because I have the same damn TV and it
did the same thing  Actually it is a Goldstar but it's essentially the
same TV and electronicsjust a different face plate and name

  Fortunately TV tubes don't explode  I'd think the TV mfrs want
to make this possibility remote as possible  If at all they'll 
implode and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion In any
case don't kick it around  

  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics  It turned
out to be a blown W resistor feeding the flyback transformer  I guess
the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created burning itself out  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first  Oh luckily I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed  I can't see it
being more than  cents

Well needless to say the TV still works today  So go get a set of
schematics and have some funjust don't get shocked poking around
the flyback

Subject Re ADC card for computer

In article qiebelllwinkenllnlgov you say

I would like to digitize the output of a SQUID magnetometer range  V
to  V and do digital signal processing in a computer say a Macintosh
II or a  PC  I would like a good  bit ADC with good linearity and a
high conversion speed at least  kHz preferably  kHz  Other concerns

  Must I use an ADC external to my computer to avoid digital noise
     feedback into my sensitive SQUID electronics

Might be a good idea  The resolution you requested is about mV
In order to get what you've paid for noise level better be lower than
that  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect
inside a PC

Before you pay  for a PC card test it out by sampling a low
distortion sine wave I think there is a sine wave on a CD  Digital
Domain   There are possibly other low THD sources  Run the digitized
waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on
the spectrum  That's should give you a good indication of the design
That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed
 I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet

If you can live with  bit resolution I would recommend looking at
the MAX from MAXIM  It is a high speed KHz complete
sampling AD with DSP interface  The input range is  V and it
uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated
from the computer to elinimate a major noise source  The Analog design
guide I got from them shows a db noise level  They claim a db
max  typ THD  Looks pretty good for the    pieces

A evaluation kit is available  Might want to give these nice folks a
call   or fax  and   ext
for application assistance

This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software
Hey you can get the MAX as a free sample just by calling the  

I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC
based ADC system

I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out
of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be
throwing out your money

  There are two simple procedures for alterating any odometer
 
  Mechanical driven odometer
     Remove the speedo cable from the transmission
     Attach a drill and run at max speed until the speedo turns over
     Continue until the desired mileage is reached
 
  Electronically driven odometer
     Remove the sensor wire from the sensor
     Attach the Calibration out signal from an Oscope to the wire
     Run until the speedo turns over and attains the desired mileage

Dear Faster I kinda wonder have you ever tried version  On what
Since the sensor wire on a BMW feeds also into the computer and we
don't know what signal voltage is expected from it bad things
could happen also since we don't know the pulse rate we
may damage the analog part of the speedo yes BMW uses a combined
instrument speed in analog trip and total milage is digital with
the needle pegged up against the MPH stop

Just a thought

You've got the oscilliscope so you connect it up to the sensor wire
and measure this stuff  That way you know what it expects

 Recently I discovered that it was possible to receive cable

 The nearer this aerial is moved to the cable which I am not
 connected to which runs under the eaves of the house the better
 the signal  Now I was wondering how can I improve the signal
 Is it possible to improve the signal significantly some channels
 
 CABLE EGRESS or emanations if you will are being radiated at free space 
 impedance from cables that may be harmonically realated to certain 
 channels and therfore the standing waves at  wave will transfer 
 efficiently Also your antenna a loose monopole is also harmonically 
 tuned and will be more efficient at  wavelength multiples
 
 Your best bet for this research is to use a tuned YAGI antenna to get the 
 gain you need Std TV roof antenna type The dipoles should be parallel 
 to the radiating cable A preamp doesn't help significantly in my 
 experience in most cases

Wow what a concept  Does anybody want to speculate on how this

It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to

Does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this

 Hello
 I'm considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and
 I need a little advice on outlet wiring  Several outlets
 are the old 'two prong' type without the ground  Naturally
 the wire feeding these outlets is  WITHOUT the ground
 wire  I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the
  with ground and that on these circuits the ground
 wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire
 
 SO  Here's my question  It seems to me that I'd have the
 same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutralDDDDDDDDDDDa jumper from the neutral
 over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding outlets
 What's wrong with my reasoning here  

First it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection
Secondly The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire
shouldn't be or only during a fault condition

The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the
tranformer on the power pole has a grounded centertap secondary with the
grounded centertap the neutral  This gives v to neutralground from
each side of the transformer and v across the transformer  So in effect
the neutral and ground should be at the same potential

No  No  NOOO

The ground green wire is for safety  No current is supposed to flow in it
under normal conditions  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in
it either  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire even if
you're grounded in some other way at the same time  

The neutral white wire is as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said the return for
the hot wire  Since current flows in it there's a voltage drop  If you
plug a heavy load into a properlywired grounded outlet you can commonly 
measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground  

They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel but nowhere
repeat NOwhere else  Well almost  There are strange exceptions for things
like subpanels

What you CAN do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  In fact
depending on where you are putting your new outlets a GFCI may be required

There is a FAQ on electrical wiring posted regularly to recwoodworking and
newsanswers  It goes into great detail on these issues including GFCIs and
you should probably read it before asking any more questions  I'll mail a copy
to you append a copy here and will ask the writers to crosspost it here in

Subject IntroductionDisclaimers

	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring we are not
	electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do  If
	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don't
	do it  Contact someone qualified  a licensed electrician
	or your local electrical inspector  Electricity is no joke
	mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution

	Furthermore our discussion is based on the US National
	Electrical Code NEC and the Canadian Electrical code CEC
	To the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail
	with the electrical code but we don't quote sections
	simply to keep this thing readable  If you think we're wrong
	we invite you to correct us but please  quote references

	The NEC and the CEC do not in and of themselves have the
	force of law  Many municipalities adopt it en toto  Others
	however do not  Check your with your local building
	department and provincial Hydro Inspection Offices in
	Canada to find out what applies in your area  Also
	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements
	for electrical service installation  Bear in mind too that
	we say here applies primarily to ordinary singlefamily
	residences  Multifamily dwellings mobile homes commercial
	establishments etc are sometimes governed by different
	rules

	Also note that contrary to popular belief in the US and in
	some parts of Canada Canada is not a whollyowned subsidiary
	of the US  Consequently the NEC does not apply in Canada
	Lots of things are the same including voltages line
	frequencies and the laws of physics  But there are a number
	of crucial differences in the regulations  Where we can we've
	noted them flagging the relevant passages with NEC'' or
	CEC''

	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards  It is often
	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements

Subject What is the NEC  Where can I get a copy

	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the
	National Fire Protection Association an insurance industry group
	It's revised every three years  The  version has been released
	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly
	at   The code exists in several versions  There's the
	full text which is fairly incomprehensible  There's an abridged
	edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses
	And there's the NEC Handbook which contains the authorized
	commentary'' on the code as well as the full text  That's the
	recommended version  Unfortunately there's no handbook for
	the abridged edition  And the full handbook is expensive 
	US plus shipping and handling

Subject What is the CEC  Where can I get a copy

	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up
	of various government agencies power utilities insurance
	companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations
	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C which is updated every two
	or three years  Each province adopts with some amendments
	this standard and publishes a provincespecific code book
	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified
	standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA
	standard itself  In this FAQ CEC really means the
	appropriate provincial standard  In particular this FAQ is
	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code th
	edition   Which is in turn based on CSA C th
	edition  While differences exist between the provinces an
	attempt has been made to avoid specifictoOntario detail

	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical
	inspection offices of your provincial power authority  In
	Ontario it's Ontario Hydro  The Ontario Hydro book isn't
	overly fat  It's about C and includes mailed updates  I
	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the
	equivalent NEC publications

	Don't bother asking in Quebec  DIY wiring is banned throughout
	the province

Subject Can I do my own wiring  Extra pointers

	In most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring
	In some they're not  Check with your local electrical
	inspector  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's
	homes for money without a license  Nor are you permitted to do
	wiring in commercial buildings  Multiple dwellings eg duplexes
	are usually considered semicommercial or commercial  However
	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semicommercial
	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician  if you can
	find one willing to supervise

	If you do your own wiring an important point

	Do it NEAT and WELL  What you really want to aim for is a better
	job than an electrician will do  After all it's your own home
	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make
	a mistake  An electrician has time pressures has the skills
	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job
	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that
	are in excess of code because we feel that it's reasonable
	and will impress the inspector

	The inspector will know that you're an amateur  You have to
	earn his trust  The best way of doing this is to spend your
	time doing as neat a job as possible  Don't cut corners
	Exceed specifications  Otherwise the inspector may get extremely
	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions

	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector

	Use the proper tools  Ie don't use a bread knife to strip
	wires or twist wires with your fingers  The inspector
	won't like it and the results won't be that safe  And it
	takes longer  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of
	ga wire through your hand that way

	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold eg below C
	or F  Thermoplastic house wire particularly older types
	become very brittle

Subject What do I need in the way of tools

	First there's the obvious  a hammer a drill a few
	screwdrivers both straight and Phillipshead  If you're 
	lucky enough to live in Canada or find a source of CSAapproved
	devices you need Robertson square recess screwdrivers
	 and  instead of phillips

	For drilling a few holes a  or  spade bit and  or
	 electric drill will do  If you're doing a lot or
	are working with elderly lumber we recommend a  drill
	rightangle drills are wonderful  Can be rented and
	 or  screwpoint auger drill bits  These bits pull
	you through so they're much faster and less fatiguing even
	in  year old hardwood timbers

	Screwdriver bits are useful for drills expecially if you
	install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws
	work well
	
	For stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or
	ordinary wire cutters  Don't buy the  Kmart combo stripper
	crimper and bottle opener types  You should expect to pay
	 to  for a good pliertype pair  It will have sized
	stripping holes and won't nick or grab the wire  it should
	be easy to strip wire with it  One model has a small hole in the
	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals  There
	are fancier types autostripcut but they generally aren't
	necessary and pros usually don't use them

	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends
	in constricted places  Don't use these for stripping wire

	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts

	You should have a pair of needlenose pliers for fiddling
	inside boxes and closing loops but it's better to form wire
	loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper  more
	accurate

	If you're using nonmetallic cable get a cable stripper for
	removing the sheath  Or do what some pros do they nick the
	end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers
	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a
	zipper and cut the sheath off  You shouldn't try to strip
	the sheath with a knife point because it's too easy to
	slash the insulation on the conductors  Apparently Stanley
	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades
	can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility
	that you'll gouge the conductors

	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable it's well
	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter US 
	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire
	or the insulation

	Threeprong outlet testers are a quick check for properlywired
	outlets  About   Multimeters tell you more but are a lot more
	expensive and probably not worth it for most people  A simple
	voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated
	wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost
	about US  at Radio Shack

	You should have a voltage detector  to check that the wires are
	dead before doing work on them  Neonbulb version are cheap 
	and work well  If you get more serious a audible alarm type is
	good for tracing circuits without a helper  Though I've been known
	to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops 

	For running wires through existing walls you need fish tape
	Often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or
	a length of thin chain will suffice  Fish tapes can be rented

	Electrical tape  Lots of it   Seriously a good and competent
	wiring job will need very little tape  The tape is useful for
	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work  Another use is to wrap 
	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination
	screws  I don't do this but drywall contractors prefer it to
	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet
	that has no cover plate

Subject What is UL listing

	The UL stands for Underwriters Laboratory  It used to be
	an Insurance Industry organization but now it is independent
	and nonprofit  It tests electrical components and equipment
	for potential hazards  When something is ULlisted that means
	that the UL has tested the device and it meets their requirements
	for safety  ie fire or shock hazard  It doesn't necessarily
	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to just
	that it probably won't kill you

	The UL does not have power of law in the US  you are
	permitted to buy and install nonULlisted devices  However
	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will
	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to
	the failure of a nonULlisted device  Furthermore in
	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component
	used for a specific purpose is ULlisted for that purpose
	Indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring
	must be ULlisted before an inspector will approve it andor
	occupancy permits issued
	
Subject What is CSA approval

	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the
	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in
	Canada  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done
	with CSAapproved materials  They perform testing similar to
	the UL a bit more stringent except that CSA approval is
	required by law

	Again like the UL if a fire was caused by nonCSAapproved
	equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the
	claim

	In Canada there is a branch organization of the UL called ULC
	UL of Canada  ULC does not have power of law and seems to
	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance
	companies

Subject Are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring

	USA The following three books were suggested by our readers

	    Residential Wiring
	    by Jeff Markell
	    Craftsman Books
	    Carlsbad CA for  ISBN 

	    Practical Electrical Wiring
	    Residential Farm and Industrial  Based on the National
	    Electrical Code    ANSINFPA 
	    Herbert P Richter and W Creighton Schwan
	    McGrawHill Book Co

	    Wiring Simplified
	    H P Richter and W C Schwan
	    Park Publishing Co
	
	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC
	revision  Which is currently 

	Canada PS Knight authors and publishes a book called
	Electrical Code Simplified  There appears to be a version
	published specific to each province and is very tied into the
	appropriate provincial code  It focuses on residential wiring
	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers  It is better to get
	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring or answer
	questions on the net 

	It is updated each time the provincial codes are  This book is
	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C

Subject Inspections how and what  Why should I get my wiring inspected

	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and
	inspections of any wiring that is done  Amongst other more
	mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not
	liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections
	provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors
	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose
	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job

	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your
	home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a
	permit  California for instance is particularly nasty about
	this

	If fire starts in your home and uninspected wiring is at
	fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage
	claims

	In general the process goes like this
		 you apply to your local inspections office or building
		  department for a permit  You should have a sketch or
		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing  This is
		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not
		  sure of  If you're doing major work they may impose
		  special conditions on you require loading
		  calculations and ask other questions  At this point
		  they will tell you which inspections you will need
		 If you're installing a main panel you will need to
		  have the panel and service connections inspected
		  before your power utility will provide a connection
		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority
		  rather than the usual inspectors
		 After installing the boxes and wiring but before
		  the insulationwalls go up you will need a
		  roughin inspection
		 After the walls are up and the wiring is complete
		  you will need a final inspection

Subject My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations
	Do I have to upgrade

	In general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings
	though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some
	cases  However any new work must be done according to the
	latest electrical code  Also if you do major'' work you
	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all
	of your system  Check with your local electrical inspector

Subject A word on voltages 

	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the
	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of
	a circuit  One person might talk about V another V
	or another V  These are all in fact exactly the same
	thing  In North America the utility companies are required
	to supply a splitphase  volt  feed to your house
	This works out as two V   legs  Additionally since there
	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring it's not
	unreasonable to find V has dropped to V or V has dropped
	to V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet  Especially
	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run  For a number
	of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness
	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers
	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them V and
	V except when actually saying what the measured voltage will
	be  Confusing  A bit  Just ignore it

	One thing that might make this a little more understandable
	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie V
	instead of V value  What this implies is that the device
	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that
	low

	V is not the same as V  V is the voltage between
	phases of a phase Y circuit that is V from neutral to any
	hot   V is the voltage between phases of a phase Y
	circuit that's V from hot to neutral

	In keeping with V versus V strangeness motors intended
	to run on V three phase are often labelled as V

Subject What does an electrical service look like

	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the
	main panel with power  Three of them will come from the utility
	pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere

 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded
 	into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes
 	to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where
	the main water pipe entering the house  Watch out for galvanic
	action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe
	This is the grounding conductor  It is there to make sure that
	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground  This wire
	normally carries no current

	One of the other wires will be white or black with white or
	yellow stripes or sometimes simply black  It is the neutral wire
	It is connected to the centre tap CEC center tap in the
	NEC of the distribution transformer supplying the power  It
	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often
	inside the panel  The neutral and ground should not be connected
	anywhere else  Otherwise weird andor dangerous things may happen

	Furthermore there should only be one grounding system in
	a home  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode
	These will be connected together or connected to the neutral
	at a common point  still one grounding system  Adding additional
	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house
	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code

	If you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually
	brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are
	not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one
	neutralground connection  However in some situations 
	certain categories of separate buildings you actually do
	have to provide a second grounding electrode  consult your
	inspector

	The other two wires will usually be black and are the hot
	wires  They are attached to the distribution transformer as
	well

	The two black wires are  degrees out of phase with each
	other  This means if you connect something to both hot wires
	the voltage will be  volts  If you connect something to the
	white and either of the two blacks you will get V

	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them
	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected
	together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one
	wire is doing dualduty as both neutral and ground or in some
	rare occasions the service has only one hot wire V only
	service

Subject What is a circuit

	Inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires
	These connections are then used to supply power to selected
	portions of the home  There are three different combinations
		 one hot one neutral and ground V circuit
		 two hots no neutral and ground V circuit
		 two hots neutral and ground V circuit  neutral
		   andor two V circuits with a common neutral

	 is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and
	lighting within your house   is usually used for supplying
	power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers  they
	often have need for both V and V or for bringing several
	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point   is
	usually for special V motor circuits electric heaters or
	air conditioners

	Note In the US the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar
	to  be used for stoves and dryers  namely that there
	are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral
	and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing
	the neutral for V purposes  three prong plugs instead
	of four only for stovesdryers connected to the main panel
	When connected to most subpanels  prong plugs and receptacles
	are required  In our notsohumble opinion this is crazy but
	the NFPA claims that this practice was reevaluated for the  NEC
	and found to be safe  Check your local codes or inquire as to
	local practice  there are restrictions on when this is
	permissible

	 is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot
	white for neutral and bare for grounding

	 and  have one hot wire coloured red the other black a
	bare wire for grounding and in  a white wire for neutral

	You will sometimes see  wired with just a black white and ground
	wire  Since the white is hot in this case both the NEC and CEC
	requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends
	to indicate that it is a live wire  Usually done with paint nail
	polish or sometimes electrical tape

	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the
	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse

	There are in a few locales circuits that look like  
	or  except that they have two bare ground wires  Some places
	require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground
	the other attaches to the motor  This may or may not be an
	alternative to GFCI protection

Subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral

	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC the
	grounding conductor is for the safety ground ie the green
	or bare wire  The word neutral is reserved for the white when
	you have a circuit with more than one hot wire  Since the white
	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the
	panel the proper term is grounded conductor  However the
	potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding
	conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes  you should
	never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire
	as the grounding conductor even though they are connected
	together in the panel

	But not in subpanels  subpanels are fed neutral and ground
	separately from the main panel  Usually

	In the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used
	for grounded conductor  This FAQ uses neutral simply to
	avoid potential confusion  We recommend that you use neutral
	too  Thus the white wire is always except in some light
	switch applications neutral  Not ground

Subject What does a fuse or breaker do  What are the differences

	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power
	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels  For
	example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should
	trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting  As
	such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the
	wiring  UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the
	equipment itself won't cause a fire

	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt
	safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby
	interrupting the power to the circuit  Fuses trip relatively
	fast  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have
	large startup current surges  For motor circuits you can use
	a timedelay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid
	tripping on momentary overloads  A fusetron looks like a
	springloaded fuse  A fuse can only trip once then it must be
	replaced

	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices  They
	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched
	into position against another contact  When the current flow
	through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip
	heats up and bends  By bending it trips the latch and the
	spring pulls the contacts apart  Circuit breakers behave
	similarly to fusetrons  that is they tend to take longer to
	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses  With high
	overloads they trip quickly  Breakers can be reset a finite
	number of times  each time they trip or are thrown
	when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which
	damages the contacts  Thus breakers should not be used in
	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the
	purpose

	Neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se  A dead
	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even
	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which
	can often cause severe damage

Subject Breakers  Can't I use fuses

	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher
	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels  This is usually
	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts
	corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse
	being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a
	penny trick

	Since breakers are more permanently installed and have better
	connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less

	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload  When
	a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting
	path  Result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel
	melted service wiring through fires in the electrical
	distribution transformer and having your house burn down
	Breakers don't do this

	Many jurisdictions particularly in Canada no longer permit
	fuse panels in new installations  The NEC does permit new
	fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special
	inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses

	Some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse
	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel  The fuse
	is there to protect the motor windings from overload  Check the
	labeling on the unit  This is usually only on large permanently
	installed motors  The installation instructions will tell you
	if you need one

Subject What size wire should I use

	For a  amp circuit use  gauge wire  For a  amp circuit
	you can use  gauge wire in most locales  For a long run
	though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid
	voltage drops   gauge is only slightly more expensive than
	 gauge though it's stiffer and harder to work with

	Here's a quick table for normal situations  Go up a size for
	more than  foot runs when the cable is in conduit or
	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate
	heat easily

		Gauge		Amps
				
				
				
				
				
	
	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent
	on the application and precise wire type

Subject Where do these numbers come from

	There are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup
	The smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is  When
	the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is
	more voltage drop in the wiring  The former is why you need
	highertemperature insulation andor bigger wires for use in
	conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long
	runs

	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances
	There are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller
	wire is allowed  The obvious one is the line cord on most
	lamps  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits
	one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger
	wire

Subject What does  mean

	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors
	in a cable  The first number specifies the gauge  The second
	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire  but
	remember there's usually an extra ground wire   means
	 gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground

	 wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire  Sometimes
	the white is red instead for V circuits without neutral  In
	the latter case the sheath is usually red too

	 wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire
	Usually carrying V with neutral

Subject What is a wirenutmarrettemarr connector  How are they
	used

	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used
	to connect wires together  Marrette or Marr connector
	are trade names  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring

	In essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them
	together then twist the wirenut on

	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the
	wire do it anyways  it's more mechanically and electrically
	secure

	There are many different sizes of wire nut  You should check
	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the
	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together

	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or
	your fingers  Use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers
	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly  Sometimes
	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it
	goes in the wirenut properly

	Some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical
	tape  This is probably not a good idea  the inspector may
	tear it off during an inspection  It's usually done because
	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut  instead
	of taping it the connection should be redone

Subject What is a GFIGFCI

	A GFCI is a groundfault circuit interrupter''  It measures
	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the
	neutral wire  If they differ by more than a few milliamps the
	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other
	path  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of
	an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person  Any
	of these situations is hazardous so the GFCI trips breaking
	the circuit

	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks  If
	for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral
	leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a GFCI
	wouldn't help  All of the current that passed from the hot
	lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the
	GFCI happy

	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric
	One is labeled LOAD the other LINE  The incoming power feed
	must be connected to the LINE side or the outlet will not be
	protected  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices
	downstream from it  Thus a whole string of outlets can be
	covered by a single GFCI outlet

Subject Where should GFCIs be used

	The NEC mandates GFCIs for V A or A single phase
	outlets in bathrooms kitchens within ' of the sink garages
	unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or
	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water
	or dampness  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets
	those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space''
	typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and
	laundry appliances

	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs  In particular there
	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or
	basement outlets  Basement outlets must be protected if you
	have a dirt floor garage outlets if they're near the door to
	outside  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs

	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection you may
	want to consider installing it anyway  Unless you need a GFCI
	breaker see below the cost is low  In the US GFCI
	outlets can cost as little as US  Costs are a bit higher in
	Canada  C  Evaluate your own risk factors  Does your
	finished basement ever get wet  Do you have small children
	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools  Does
	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage

Subject Where shouldn't I use a GFCI

	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that a don't pose a
	safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run
	unattended for long periods of time  Refrigerators freezers
	and sump pumps are good examples  The rationale is that GFCIs
	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips  Some people claim that
	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary
	current imbalance tripping the GFCI  Note though that most
	GFCI trips are real if you're getting a lot of trips for no
	apparent reason you'd be welladvised to check your wiring
	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless

Subject What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker

	For most situations you can use either a GFCI outlet as the
	first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with
	a builtin GFCI  The former is generally preferred since GFCI
	breakers are quite expensive  For example an ordinary GE
	breaker costs US the GFCI model costs US  There is one
	major exception  if you need to protect a multiwire branch
	circuit'' two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire
	such as a Canadianstyle kitchen circuit you'll need a
	multipole GFCI breaker  Unfortunately these are expensive
	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on
	what brand of panel box you have  But if you must protect such
	a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice

	One more caveat  GFCI outlets are bulky  You may want to use
	an oversize box when installing them  On second thought use
	large actually deep boxes everywhere  You'll thank yourself for it

	Incidentally if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one
	specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you don't
	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first
	outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet
	in the bathroom and not GFCI anything upstream of it  But
	protecting the whole circuit is preferred

	When you install a GFCI it's a good idea to use the little
	ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark
	the outlets downstream of the GFCI  You can figure out which
	outlets are downstream simply by tripping the GFCI with the
	test button and see which outlets are dead

Subject What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then

	Apart from their use in electronics which we won't comment on
	and for certain fluorescent lights they won't turn on without
	a good ground connection they're intended to guard against
	insulation failures within the device  Generally the case of
	the appliance is connected to the ground lead  If there's an
	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the
	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly
	trips the circuit breaker in the process  If the case is not
	grounded and such a short occurs the case is live  and if
	you touch it while you're grounded you'll get zapped  Of
	course if the circuit is GFCIprotected it will be a very
	tiny zap  which is why you can use GFCIs to replace
	ungrounded outlets both NEC and CEC

	There are some appliances that should never be grounded  In
	particular that applies to toasters and anything else with
	exposed conductors  Consider  if you touch the heating
	electrode in a toaster and you're not grounded nothing will
	happen  If you're slightly grounded you'll get a small shock
	the resistance will be too high  But if the case were
	grounded and you were holding it you'd be the perfect path to
	ground

Subject Why is one prong wider than the other  Polarization

	Nowadays many twoprong devices have one prong wider than the
	other  This is so that the device could rely not guaranteed
	on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot
	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the
	the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to
	have an approximate ground reference ie some radios

	Most prong extension cords have wide prongs too

	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right
	way around  You want the wide prong to be neutral and the
	narrow one hot  Most outlets have a darker metal for the
	hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral
	If not you can usually figure out which is which by which
	prong the terminating screw connects to

Subject What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen

	The NEC requires at least two  amp small appliance
	circuits'' for kitchens  The CEC requires splitduplex
	receptacles  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more
	than  NEC  mm CEC from an outlet  Every counter wider
	than  NEC or  mm CEC must have at least one outlet
	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except
	in the kitchen pantry or dining room  Furthermore these circuits
	are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves
	lighting etc  Nondedicated outlets within ' of a sink must be
	protected by a GFCI NEC only

	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a V circuit  The tab
	is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to
	the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet
	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw  When
	carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be
	pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral
	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect
	from downstream outlets

Subject Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms

	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to
	the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in
	the light fixture  All such outlets must be GFCIprotected

Subject What is RomexNMNMD  What is BX  When should I use each

	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire
	Sometimes called nonmetallic sheath  The formal name is NM
	This is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside
	stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject
	to mechanical damage or excessive heat  Most newer homes are
	wired almost exclusively with NM wire  There are several
	different categories of NM cable

	BX cable  technically known as armored cable or AC has a
	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is
	fairly resistant to damage

	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic
	sheath
	
	Protection for cable in concealed locations where NM or AC cable
	is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer
	surface of the cable must be kept at least mm CEC  NEC
	from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected
	from mechanical injury  This latter protection can take the form of
	metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit

	Note inspectorpermitted practise in Canada suggests that armored
	cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection
	but this is technically illegal

	Additional protection recommendations these are rules in the
	Canadian codes  they are reasonable answers to the vague
	references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the NEC
	and CEC

	     NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage
	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls
	      in exposed locations under  feet from the floor
	      Ie use AC instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc
	     Where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces
	      or water heaters the wire should be protected  Canadian
	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet
	      box on the wall and use a short length of AC cable
	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance
	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used
	     Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating
	      ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by
	      means of a mm air space or suitable insulation
	      material a wad of fiberglass
	     NM cable shall be supported within mm' of every box
	      or fitting and at intervals of no more than m'
	      Holes in joists or studs are considered supports
	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to
	      each box  while fishing cable is technically in violation
	      it is permitted where proper support is impractical
	      conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge
	      Knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring
	      to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured
	      in the breach
	     cable should never be buried in plaster cement or
	      similar finish
	     cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards
	     Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists
	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more
	      than m 

	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small
	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to
	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through
	the insulation

	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by
	solid wall coverings

	In places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of
	a garage  you may be required to use conduit a
	UL or CSA approved metal pipe  You use various types of
	fittings to join the pipe or provide entranceexit for the
	wire

	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit

	In damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will
	need special wire eg CEC NMW NEC UF  NMW looks like
	very heavyduty NMD  You will usually need short lengths of
	conduit where the wire entersexits the ground  See underground
	wiring section

 	Thermoplastic sheath wire such as NM NMW etc should not be
 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that
 	purpose

	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through
	furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed
	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces   The reason for this
	is that if there's a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses
	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building
	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas
	
 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US
 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the
 	temperature rating in Celsius  Eg AC versus AC
	In the US NMB is  degrees celcius

	NOTE local codes vary  This is one of the items that changes
	most often  Eg Chicago codes require conduit everywhere
	There are very different requirements for mobile homes
	Check your local codes especially if you're doing anything
	that's the slightest out of the ordinary

Subject Should I use plastic or metal boxes

	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with nonmetallic cable
	only  The reasoning is simple  with armored cable the box
	itself provides ground conductor continuity  US plastic
	boxes don't use metal cable clamps

	The CEC is slightly different  The CEC never permits cable
	armor as a grounding conductor  However you must still
	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath  The CEC also
	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes

	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for
	nonmetallic sheathed cable  you can avoid making one ground
	connection and they sometimes cost a little less  On the other
	hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts  For
	exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better

Subject Junction box positioning

	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together

	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible
	later  Ie not buried under plaster  Excessive use of junction
	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may
	get nasty

Subject Can I install a replacement light fixture

	In general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few
	caveats  First of course one should check the amperage
	rating of the circuit  If your heart is set on installing half
	a dozen  watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire
	back to the panel box  But there are some more subtle
	constraints as well  For example older house
	wiring doesn't have hightemperature insulation  The excess
	heat generated by a ceilingmounted lamp can and will cause the
	insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results
	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high
	temperature wire only  You may find in fact that your
	ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case
	replacing any devices is a real adventure

	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some
	fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and
	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy
	chandelier or ceiling fan  You may need to install a new box
	specifically listed for this purpose  A x across the ceiling
	joists makes a good support  Metal brackets are also available
	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and
	mounted between the joists

	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as
	pot lamps or heat lamps  When these are installed in insulated
	ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard
	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated
	ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually
	'xx  made by making a pair of joists  high and covering
	with plywood that doesn't have any insulation  Yes that's  feet
	long

	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent  They require at least 
	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation
	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement
	which means that a CECstyle coffin'' might be worthwhile
	Presumably that's up to the local inspector  The CEC doesn't
	actually mandate the coffin perse this seems to be an inspector
	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get
	accidentally buried in insulation  Ie if you have insulation blown
	in later

	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and
	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation  They are
	usually limited to  watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat
	more expensive than the older types  Before you use them you should
	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses
	Follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location
	for the sensor can vary

	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved
	for use in insulation  The coffin appears the only legal approach

Subject What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts

	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is
	loose  Depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up
	being more than V and the other less than V with
	respect to ground  This is a very hazardous situation  it can
	destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in
	some situations electrocute you ie some US jurisdictions
	require the stove frame connected to neutral

	If this happens contact your electrical authority immediately
	and have them come and check out the problem

	Note a brief   second brightening is sometimes normal with
	lighting and motors on the same V with neutral circuit  A
	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness
	far longer than one second  In case of doubt get help

Subject What is  phase power  Should I use it  Can I get it in my house

	Three phase power has three hot wires  degrees out of
	phase with each other  These are usually used for large motors
	because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque
	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper

	You're most likely to encounter a  phase circuit that shows
	 volts between any hot and ground and  volts between
	any two hots  The latter shows the difference between a normal
	VV common neutral circuit which is  volts between the
	two hots  There are  phase circuits with different voltages

	Bringing in a  phase feed to your house is usually
	ridiculously expensive or impossible  If the equipment you
	want to run has a standard motor mount it is MUCH cheaper to
	buy a new V or V motor for it  In some cases it is
	possible to run  phase equipment on ordinary power if you have
	a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a
	autogenerator  These are tricky but are a good solution if
	the motor is nonstandard size or too expensive or too big to
	replace  The Taunton Press book The Small Shop'' has an
	article on how to do this if you must

	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using
	such a converter  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that

Subject Is it better to run motors at  or 

	Theoretically it doesn't make any difference  However there
	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply
	wiring  All things being equal a V motor will lose  times
	less power in the house wiring than a V motor  This also
	means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor
	will get to speed quicker  And in some circumstances the
	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life

	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more
	than  feet long

Subject What is this nonsense about HP on V A circuits

	It is a universal physical law that  HP is equal to 
	watts  Given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies
	it is usually best to consider  HP is going to need 
	watts  A V A circuit can only deliver  watts to a motor
	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately  HP  Given rational
	efficiency factors HP is more like it

	Some equipment manufacturers Sears in particular most router
	manufacturers in general  advertise a HP rating that is far
	in excess of what is possible  They are giving you a stall
	horsepower or similar  That means the power is measured when
	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load
	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that
	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker
	will trip otherwise the motor will melt  it's drawing far
	more current than it can continuously

	When comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower  This
	should be on the motor nameplate  If you can't find that figure
	check the amperage rating which is always present

Subject How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong

	Older homes frequently have twoprong receptacles instead
	of the more modern three  These receptacles have no safety
	ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire  Neither
	the NEC or CEC permits installing new  prong receptacles anymore

	There are several different approaches to solving this
	     If the wiring is done through conduit or BX and the
	       conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect
	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle
	       box  NEC mainly  CEC frowns on this practise
	     If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and
	       it's continuous to the main house ground point you can
	       run a conductor to it from the third prong
	     Run a ground conductor back to the main panel
	     Easiest install a GFCI receptacle  The ground lug
	       should not be connected to anything but the GFCI
	       protection itself will serve instead  The GFCI
	       will also protect downstream possibly also two prong
	       outlets  If you do this to protect downstream outlets
	       the grounds must not be connected together  Since it
	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground a wiring fault
	       could energize the cases of  prong devices connected
	       to other outlets  Be sure though that there aren't
	       indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath
	       on BX cable

	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three
	prong if you fill the U ground with a nonconducting goop
	Like caulking compound  This is not permitted in the NEC

Subject Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets
	Should the test button work

	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say  Remember though
	that your local codes may vary  As for the TEST button  there's
	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE
	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button  Current
	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the GFCI
	This is a simple passive and reliable test and doesn't require
	a real ground to work  If your GFCI does not trip when you press
	the TEST button it is very probably defective or miswired  Again
	if the test button doesn't work something's broken and potentially
	dangerous  The problem should be corrected immediately

	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground
	wire must be connected  We do not know why they say this  The
	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the
	formalities of UL or CSA listing  perhaps the device was never
	tested without the ground wire being connected  On the other hand
	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device
	behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded
	outlet replacement  One of us called Leviton their GFCIs are
	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only  The technician
	was surprised to see that he agreed that the NEC does not require
	it and promised to investigate

Subject How should I wire my shop

	As with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all
	devices that will be on simultaneously  The code specifies
	that you should stay under  of the nominal capacity of the
	circuit  For typical home shop use this means one circuit for
	the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or
	shop vac  Use at least  gauge wire  many power tools have
	big motors with a big startup surge  If you can use  amp
	breakers NEC though CEC requires standard A receptacles
	which means you'd have to replug all your equipment  Lights
	should either be on a circuit of their own  and not shared
	with circuits in the rest of the house  or be on at least two
	separate circuits  The idea is that you want to avoid a
	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand
	RPM while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch

	Do install lots of outlets  It's easier to install them in the
	beginning when you don't have to cut into an existing cable
	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each
	point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same
	time as the tool you really want  But use metal boxes and
	plates and maybe even metalsheathed cable you may have
	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit
	wrong

	Note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring
	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used
	for working  What this means is that all wiring must be
	run along structural members  Ie stapled to studs

	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits V
	circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits
	Don't overload circuits and don't use extension cords if you
	can help it unless they're rated for high currents  A coiled
	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of
	the same gauge  Also the insulation won't withstand as much
	heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue

	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel
	you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop
	wiring from it  If you have young children you may want to
	equip this panel with a cutoff switch and possibly a lock
	If you want to install individual switches to safe''
	particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough
	For example ordinary light switches are not safely able to
	handle the startup surge generated by a table saw  Buy
	horsepowerrated'' switches instead

	Finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished
	basements hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply  And
	even if you know'' that you'd never use one of your shop
	outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might
	have a different idea

	Note Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop
	wiring  April  is one place to start

Subject Underground Wiring

	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications use
	special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic
	tubing and possibly lumber don't use creosoted lumber it rots
	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion
	of lead  The transition from inhouse to underground wire is
	generally via conduit  All outdoor boxes must be specifically
	listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets
	fittings etc  If the location of the box is subject to immersion
	in water a more serious style of waterproof box is needed  And
	of course don't forget the GFCIs

	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to
	jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about
	your specific situation

	A hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power
	line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed

Subject Aluminum wiring

	During the 's aluminum instead of copper wiring became
	quite popular and was extensively used  Since that time
	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires
	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations
	We recommend even if you're allowed to that do not use it for new
	wiring

	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring  Aluminum
	wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper
	Aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper
	installation  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential
	problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe

	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as
	cold creep  When aluminum wiring warms up it expands  When
	it cools down it contracts  Unlike copper when aluminum goes
	through a number of warmcool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each
	time  To make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes
	when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance
	of the connection goes up  Which causes it to heat up and corrode
	oxidize still more  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot
	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to and possibly even
	cause a fire

	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move
	into a house built during the 's we will cover basic points of
	safe aluminum wiring  We suggest that if you're considering purchasing
	a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you
	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring
	for the following things

	     Fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to
	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it  The device will
	       be stamped with AlCu or COALR  The latter supersedes
	       the former but both are safe   These fixtures are somewhat
	       more expensive than the ordinary ones

	     Wires should be properly connected at least  way around
	       the screw in a clockwise direction  Connections should be
	       tight  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the
	       problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug
	       up each connection

	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the
	       main service entrance cable  It should be inspected

	     pushin terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire
	       Any connections using pushin terminals should be redone with
	       the proper screw connections immediately

	     There should be no signs of overheating darkened connections
	       melted insulation or baked fixtures  Any such damage should
	       be repaired
	    
	     Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be
	       handled specially  Current Canadian codes require that the
	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting
	       aluminum to copper  The NEC requires that the wire be
	       connected together using special crimp devices with an
	       antioxidant grease  The tools and materials for the latter
	       are quite expensive  not practical to do it yourself unless
	       you can rent the tool

	     Any nonrated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring
	       by means of a short copper pigtail  See  above
	    
	     Shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped
	       not nicked wire etc
    
	If when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring
	shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider
	the wiring safe  If there are signs of problems in many places
	we suggest you look elsewhere  If the wrong receptacles are used
	you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails  having
	this professionally done can range from  to  per receptacleswitch
	You can do this yourself too

Subject I'm buying a house  What should I do

	Congratulations  But  It's generally a good idea to hire
	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas
	Not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well  If an
	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor
	ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any
	minor problems are fixed  If there are signs of problems in many
	places we suggest you look elsewhere

	Here's some hints on what to look for

	Obvious noncode wiring can include

		 Zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls
		 Hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without
		  proper marking
		 Ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of
		  a GFCI
		 Splices hanging in midair other than proper knobandtube
		 Switched neutrals
		 Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines

	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one
	time sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations

		 Switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps
		   not properly terminated wiring
		 A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are
		  separately controlled by other wall switches  except when
		  it's really convenient 
		 Switches and outlets in bizarre locations
		 Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps
		 Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them
		 Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or
		  ceiling
		 Backwrapped grounding wires

Subject What is this weird stuff  Old style wiring
	
	In the years since Edison invented electricity several different
	wiring styles have come and gone  When you buy an older home you
	may encounter some of this stuff  This section describes the old 
	methods and some of their idiosyncrasies

	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called
	knob and tube KT  It is made up of individual conductors with
	a cloth insulation  The wires are run along side structural
	members eg joists or studs using ceramic standoffs knobs
	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes  Connections
	were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping
	with tape  Since the hot and neutral were run separately
	the wiring tends to be rather confusing  A neutral often runs
	down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture
	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next  In some
	cases KT isn't colourcoded so the neutral is often the same
	colour as the hot wires

	You'll see KT in homes built as late as the 's

	Comments on KT

		 the people installing KT were pretty paranoid about
		  electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good
		 The wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up
		  very well  Most KT I've seen for example is in
		  quite good condition
		 No grounding  Grounding is usually difficult to install
		 boxes are small  Receptacle replacement particularly with
		  GFCI can be difficult  No bushing on boxes either
		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry
		 Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between
		  separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to
		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on
		  any circuit
		 Building code does not permit insulation in walls
		  that contain KT
		 Connection to existing KT from new circuits can be
		  tricky  Consult your inspector
		 Modern wiring practise requires considerably more
		  outlets to be installed than KT systems did
	
	Since KT tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't
	necessary to replace it simply because it's KT  What you should
	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and
	be cautious about circuit loading  In many cases it's perfectly
	reasonable to leave existing KT alone and add new fixtures on
	new circuits using modern techniques
	
	After KT they invented multiconductor cable  The first type
	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation  It looks
	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two  This stuff was
	used in the 's and 's  Again no grounding conductor
	It was installed much like modern wiring  Its major drawback
	is that this type of insulation embrittles  We've seen whole
	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at
	a touch  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems

	This stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if
	the wires become bare  This wiring should be left untouched as
	much as possible  whenever an opportunity arises replace it
	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several
	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heatshrink
	tubing

	After this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented
	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth  Often a bit sticky
	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard
	and is reasonably easy to work with  It does not need to be
	replaced  it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff 
	thermoplastic insulation wire  Just don't abuse it too much

Subject Where do I buy stuff

	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you  Their
	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or
	DIY centres have better quality materials have wider variety
	including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that
	know what you're talking about  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable

 I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that
 this board would be most appropriate
 I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
 are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
 that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
 actual purpose of those things are I hear that they're called
 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool

Water Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the
reactor they use the reactor to generate heat The heat is then used to
heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station and the
resultant steam drives the turbines

The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water
to continue the cycle

An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two opamps to form the

mixer If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum snap
crackle and pop sounds formed by ground loops can be tolerated
the opamp solution is just what you are looking for It is

Not sure but Craig Anderton did introduce one DIbox project

This is indeed one function but more sophisticated ones do level control
and groundlift separating the keyboard and mixer earths aswell

Simple ones are just that  a transformer A decent quality audio trans

       GND    GND

The groundlift switch disconnects the GND line from the mixer The
transformer ratio depends on the precise application but around 
turns ratio may be a good place to start

Does anyone out there have any experience suggestions advice etcthat they'd like to pass on I'd greatly appreciate it

Without doing anything really tricky the best I've seen is the

I've had very good results from the SSM from PMI part of Analogue

    I was wondering if anyone out there in netland knew of a SIMPLE
way to make a band equalizer single channel  I need it to accept
LINE inputs tape deck CD player etc and output to the same So
input impedance should equal output impedance  Also since I am driving
a line I would need  volt pp output  Final requirement is that I
can either
	       Control it digitally
			OR
	       Control it easily or with few resistors

FINALLY  If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips that might
be useful please let me know I have seen a couple of them from NATIONAL
and MAXIM  Thanks in advance

Dear Netters
I want to send EMGsignals from a running person to a computer 
Each signal is KHz wide and there is up to  of them on each
running person The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred 
meters It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is
about MHz and about MHz
To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best 
the to send the signals in an analog form As this application is rather 
specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter
units i need
On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere I 
need a multichannel up to  channels receiver or  complete  
receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers 
as needed in the particular case
DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER 
SYSTEM ON THE MARKET

 I want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying Adcom seperates
 I have heard from alot of people though that Adcom sounds great but
 that the components are made cheaply and therefore won't last very long
 The time estimates I've heard are like only  or  years  Is this true

I own the Adcom W power amp  As far as I'm concerned there's no
  amp which can touch it at the price range
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing
If you open the amp up there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers  one for each
  channel  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model  ie very good

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast
  or whereever  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant
I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last  not with
  those quality components inside  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot  but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good

My last point I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the  or something  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new

If you build an amplifier decently like the Adcom's they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time  period

Just my thoughts but then  I do own one of Adcom's amps

I missed the first articles on this line due to not having a
chance to read the news for a couple of days

The idea is commercialized in at least one product the Private
Eye  That's a small cubeshaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was HerculesMDA
compatible  The innards are a row  LEDs that are swept up
and down by a galvonometerlike movement  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background

I didn't like the device very much  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an outoftheway key
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz  Properly
used however the image clarity was quite crisp

I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two but it did seem to have promise

Offshore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products 
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van 
Alstine and better than Hafler and Forte' but at a much lower cost 

How do you spell tuna helper  

I gather by offshore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
bluefin tuna's who are into that squidfi sound  I agree on that one 
My Adcom  preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
running the chips class A resistor mod and replacing the metal 
bottom cover with plexiglass too bad the factory could not make em sound 
better but better sound unfortunately does not appear to be a priority 
with Adcom else the mods would neither have been necessary nor would they 
have improved what was already touted as superlative stateodart le'sound 
I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
from an spII even an spa to a GFPetc or maybe from those that 
have dumped their forte' amps for a GFAetc

I have an Adcom GFA that I got in   There certainly isn't
anything magic about it  The components used are decent but
nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components

The GFA is a nice piece of equipment  I'm glad that Adcom had
the guts to not overdo the packaging  It irks me when I see
audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably
cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they
are supposed to serve

I don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which
something is assembled  This is especially true for something as
lowtechnology as a GFA

I'd hope that a GFA would still work well after several years
Except under conditions of extreme abuse there isn't much there to
go wrong

  What's the chance of this working Any systems like this already exist
  What kind of accuracy could you expect What would something like this
  cost to prototype Is there a better alternative than microwaves
 
 Of course you could develope this system but there is already a system  
called Global
 Positioning Satellites  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on  
earth 
 Many surveyors use this system with a differential receivertransmitter to  
get
 coordinates within centimeters  Basic receivers with resolution of a few  
meters on

Thought it means Global Positioning System There are two precision levels one  
for army applications killing has to be very accurate today and one for civil  
ones The civil precision is about  to m correct me if I'm wrong  
though it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings But there is a way with  
an additional reference point eg one fixed GPS system in a house to get the  
same high precision as the military version but it gets pretty complicated  
then If You use a microwave system actually this means some type of radar  
You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  
Your original signals So the GPS system seems to be the better and running  
idea for Your applicationthere have been discussions in this newsgroup don't  
know of an address anymore

If the set is direct line powered try checking the likely to be
there hybrid regulator module down stream from the  volt
supply  Several sets I've looked at use a  volt regulator  The
regulators have a tendency to short out making the safety circuits
shut down the EHT supply section

Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower
the AC input voltage to the set to about  volts  If the set
operates nromally then you know you've got a shorted regulator

There are myriad other areas for problems but I've seen the one
above several times  Also if the set uses one the trippler
module may be shot that's fairly common

Does anyone know what causes the evergrowing black border around the
edges of my computer screen  The growth has been gradual so I don't
know how long it's taken to get this bad  I have a  DEC 
color monitor maybe five years old and the black border is about 
inches on the left and right sides about  inches on the bottom and
negligible at the top of the screen  The only controls are
brightness knob contrast knob deGauss switch and power switch

Is there anything to be done or are the monitor's days numbered

  Output offset  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope

  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded  Many

Think about the ratio of K and then think about the accuracy
to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope  You can
virtually discount the loading of the DUT  Also you have the
millivolt test generator you want

Hi
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a highspeed silicon ADC Mhz currently being 
fabricated This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB I expect to have roughly 
packaged circuits and will do DC lowspeed and highspeed
testing using  different setups for the test chip
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
the long lead lines have too high an inductance
Getting a custommade package is too expensive so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds
 
	Does anyone out there have experienceknowledge
of this field  I would greatly appreciate help Any ideas
names of companies manufacturing holderssocketspackages
would help 
 
PS The multilayer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit
of overkill

Just to complete that thought the cooling towers cool water that
circulates through heat exchangers that recondense the turbine
exhaust back into feedwater for the heat exchangers that transfer
energy from the reactor's cooling circuit

The reactor has a closed loop circuit to prevent radioactive
contamination of the the turbine feedwater

The cooling tower is a separate circuit to avoide contamination of
the turbine feedwater with atmospheric contamininats etc
Purifying boiler feedwater is important business at both fossil
fired and nuclear generation facilities

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this but never mind
Any machine powered by heat motor steam or gasturbine steamengine  
thermoelementetc work the better the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium steam burning gaz etc You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high A thermal electric power plant coal  
oil or atomic power works just the same way You heat water steam to power  
the turbine and generators Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam efficency is never  You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose some  
type of megarefrigerator Others use water of a river ecologically not  
unobjectionable Got it

SO  Here's my question  It seems to me that I'd have the
same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutral jumper from the
neutral over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding
outlets What's wrong with my reasoning here

First go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of Wiring
Simplified by HL Richter  Now if your house is wired with metal
conduit you don't need a seperate ground wire assuming the house
is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water
pipe in your basement  The outlets that have a neutral hooked to
the ground screw seem wrong  Anyone else think so

Back in the 's I was a service technician for a cash register company
The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were
VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise  The biggest
problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded

In almost every place we went to do an installation we found outlets
with the ground connected to the neutral  For  of the things you
can plug into one of these they work fine  For our cash registers they
were a nightmare  line noise tended to scramble the memory
periodically

With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be
less of a problem  Even the company I used to work for is no longer
recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their
equipment  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find
that the ground and neutral are connected  Although not ideal it
should be ok for most applications


  SLMR   My reality check just bounced

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate
If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at KHz that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies you'd have   Hz per
channel sampling rate  That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish

Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation  A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced

A commercial handheld transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth
Obviously this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location

What you CAN do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  In fact
depending on where you are putting your new outlets a GFCI may be required

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter
So rewiring is still a part of this job however the ground may be connected to
a local earth ground rather than back at the breaker box

As Jamie said GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places most
notably bathrooms and outside the house  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets
rather than the breakers  You will end up with much less headaches  Noise pickup
in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers

GFCI devices do save lives if you decide to install them be sure to check them
regularly using the test button

Running the family business electrical supplies and lighting for many years I
have seen too many seasoned electricians fried because they forgot to double check
their common sense list  Please exercise caution

During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day

Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be Power companies
are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
raw uranium emisions to be held to under  This law is now under attack
by lawyers arguing that the  should be measured at the edge of the property
rather than the edge of the cooling tower Eliminating this law will save
power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes

Oddly enough you don't at least according to the wiring FAQ that

A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents
and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found  No ground connection
is needed for it to function

We have a setup with with  polaroid transducers and rangefinders We
would like to fire these three at a time with about  ms between
firings The three that are being fired do not fire in the same
direction 

To further explain the situation assume we are firing sonars ABC
 ms apart each other We should normally see an echo on A that
corresponds to the distance However sonar A detects the INIT line
of sonar B The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A
we can see a very faint Khz signal on the transducer exactly at the
time the init line of sonar B is activated 

We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference
We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
for sonars B and C 

Has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and
this type of experience Your suggestions for remedies will be greatly
appreciated

My next project is to come up with an IFdetector module for fast  
to  kBsec  packet radio use  No fancy modulation scheme just
wide FSK for use at  or  MHz

I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola  chip but I wonder if there
are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies

My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back
end with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other  I'm
particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than   do any
current chips work up to say MHz with internal downconversion so a
normal IF filter can be used

Any suggestions

This is vague so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
pickup  The result was noisy and distinctly lofi but much louder
than a conventional phonograph  It tended to wear the disks out
pretty quickly though

I have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply Made
by Cannon that I need to replace  The fuse is not the standard
tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc but is a 
rectangular plastic package much like a transistor or diode  It
is about xx with both leads coming out of one of the
x sides  I have been told that it was made by MITI a asian
company but I can find no information as to a supplier  This fuse
is rated at A C  Does anyone have a source for this fuse  I
only need  or so which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want
to talk to me let alone deal with me

Please advise via Email

Thanks

The simplest one is easy  Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit and
stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts  The two strips must
be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc  Then connect a voltmeter to

Not even in sub panels  The only place the neutral should be connected to the

maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service

You are experiencing what is called Macrovision  It is the protection 
that they use on the video tapes  There are two ways around this that I 
know of  First of all you can try using a different VCR to copy onto
It is the input of the VCR that reacts to the protection so sometimes 
just switching the two VCRs around will take care of it  Some models 
just don't react to it

Does this also affect the viewing of tapes  I have had problems with
a couple of rented tapes they were virtually unviewable I fiddled 
with the tuning tracking and vertical hold but it was no good

There's another question will the voltage drop be low enough
But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or
just the resistivity of copper  Keep traces short and use separate

SO  Here's my question  It seems to me that I'd have the
same electrical circuit if I hooked a jumper from the neutral
over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding outlets
What's wrong with my reasoning here  

May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this  The ground is
supposed to be a protective ground and though what you suggest
looks good on paper it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for
power and protection  It'd never meet code and if you now own
the property and later sell it you may end up with liabilities
you don't want and if you don't now own it well

There's a wiring FAQ that I think addresses this  I believe
an alternative is use of a GFCI but I'm really not sure what
current code allows in this area  The GFCI senses alternate
unwanted current paths and doesn't rely on a specific
protective ground wire at least not beyond the GFCI in the
protected circuit  GFCI breakers are available but expensive

  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the
th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings

  I built  watt FSK transceivers at  MHz  They are essentially
double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at  MHz
The receiver uses the MC which is the same FSK receiver chip I used
previouslyu in the  Mbps  GHz data link I first published in Ham
Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook

  The MC which includes a VHF converter section could also be used
at these speeds  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design
of this the MC if I remember rightly

  While using this would have let me reduce the external IF count on
receive it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I
didn't bother with it

  The radios I built were first designed and built for  kbps in a 
MHz channel but later reduced to half that  These  kbps radios
actually have done quite well in acrossthebench tests at  kbps and
speed is pretty much a function of filter design  Handling the data
stream is another matter entirely

  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a
beacon test mode  While there is not yet endend twoway data flow
due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware MIO
also shown in the CNC proceedings data is perfect copy at ngn  Even
though the data clock is currently at about half speed the a  kbytes
of the test text chapter  of Isaiah takes only a little over  of
a second

  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in
and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable Borland
IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the
proceedings but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running
low on resources of time money and energy

  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW
ID after the text on the mark side at  MHz from beacons on Sonoma
Mtn and Black Mtn overlooking Si valley  The antenna is horizontally
polarized

  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly
approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and
you might want to carefully consider your target  If you can't
arrange your paths such that you have complete lineofsight I think
you'll want to address the intersymbolinterference caused by
multipath and probably link CN budgets if paths are very far from LOS
For more details see the th CNC  I'm currently working on a spread
spectrum direct conversion design to address some of these problems
I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems

Hello

I just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at
least pick up the  networks and NBC     I do not have tons of
money nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution
for reception for under  dollars  I have seen modules that you plug
into your wall outlet that supposedly make your entire house an
antenna  I have to admit even with my limited knowledge of wavelength
and aerial reception this seems dubious in its claims for excellent
reception at best  I'll try anything though if it WORKS  I am in
a nonmountainous area approximately  miles from the transmitting stations
which are pretty large Montgomery Alabama pop  and Colombus Goergia
pop   Any recommendations of products brandnames prices and 
company info catalog ordering numbers addresses etc  Thank you in
advance

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for
antenna simulation particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations
though good PC software would also be of interest
I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations and have been using MN for
some time now  I'm primarily interested in HF VHF and low UHF   MHz
designs mostly wire antennas but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well
as for your basic thin wire assumption
Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself  I've seen a version
that was mutilated to run sort of under Microsoft Fortran but I'm not
sure how many new and improved versions of the code might be out there
somewhere

Hi
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a highspeed silicon ADC Mhz currently being 
fabricated This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB I expect to have roughly 
packaged circuits and will do DC lowspeed and highspeed
testing using  different setups for the test chip
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
the long lead lines have too high an inductance
Getting a custommade package is too expensive so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds
 
	Does anyone out there have experienceknowledge
of this field  I would greatly appreciate help Any ideas
names of companies manufacturing holderssocketspackages
would help 
 
PS The multilayer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit
of overkill

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue  Where
exactly are you running MHz  THe digital side  TTL
ECL  We run MHz and MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain and we use DIP's along
with PLCC's mil and mil pitch pin QFP's to name
a few  I don't see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices  

A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design
Handbook The latest ed is dated   That is considered
to be one of the bibles in highspeed design

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
you're most likely going to need a socket  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing not to mention any impedance discontinuities  I
don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isn't going to make that much difference

If you're trying to get TTL to run at MHz have fun
TTL was never designed to run in a MHz environment

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast
  or whereever  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant

Good pointalso I wouldn't be surprised that the components
they use offshore are of inferior quality  As long as it was
properly designed and robust premium components are used it
shouldn't matter where it is assembled

I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last  not with
  those quality components inside  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot  but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good

An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound
The amp you have probably is running ClassA the whole day

Actually I'd be wary of excessively hot amps 'cauz even though
the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive 
heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component
regardless of quality  In fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is
because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  Hmmmmm

During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough

major failure of the power plant  Second the primary water
that circulates inside the reactor core is never pumped into the
cooling tower it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes

into flame on contact with air

Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day

I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on V to my
cpu board which runs at V  The optoisolator is a N
On the led side I put the signal I want through a k resistor
to the base of a N  On the transistor side I tie my
cpu input line to the collector which has a pullup resistor
of k

It functions OK but seems VERY slow  I can detect pulses
that occur at about kHz but not much faster  Isn't the
risefall time of this device something like uS  I should
be able to detect my target of kHz but I can't get kHz
This is done using wirewrap and the wires going to the cpu
and to the test pin are about  inches long but I'm not
doing anything highspeed

In the Art of Electronics it mentions tying the base of the
phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
speed  Is that what I need to do  How do I calculate the
resistor value

 My friend has a nice Alpine car stereo and it only has  channels
 but one of them does not work It does not put out any current or voltage
 at all is that channel therefore blown  I then shut the radio off and
 ran continuity into the two speaker ouputs of the channel and it charged
 and discharged so I know the wires just aint bad 

This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series
between the onechip singleended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there

 any Ideas 

Open it up and look for the power amp ICs  They'll be fairly obvious 
Replace the one connected to the dead output 

 also
 how would I locate where the signal of the radiotape unit is BEFORE it
 gets amplified because then couldn't I hook up RCA outputs to that signal
 so then he could just use a little amplifier 

Well one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp
chips  Use a probe with a M resistor like a scope probe connected to the
input of a small audio amp wspeaker  If you find linelevel input to both
chips one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily  

If you want to pick off a nearlinelevel signal suitable for feeding to an
outboard amp the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good
enough  This is before the volume control and usually before the tone and
balance controls too  If you take off from the center and ground legs of
the volume pot this will be after the volume control but again probably 
before the other controls  

If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip you should
probably forget the whole thing

early PA
 I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification
 Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
 pickup  The result was noisy and distinctly lofi but much louder
 than a conventional phonograph  It tended to wear the disks out
 pretty quickly though

An nowdeceased prof told us willing students about a project he had
worked on during WWII

They needed a megapower PA with very clear audio quality The purpose
was to bellow at refugees from aircraft

Their solution was a giant compressedair source and a horn with
parallel shutters worked by a small audio system I think he said it
worked very well thus the War Dept cancelled the project

TD  I read the installation instructions on a  wave antenna
TDand they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 
TDand channel  for a minimum reading  Question is why channel
TD and 

The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave probably not the 
best explanation but the rest makes sense A one wave will cancell itself 
out BTW no such beastie  The best is a  wave antenna followed by 
 then  etc

As for SWRing in what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct 
length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on Since the 
wavelength varies with the channel you use then it's recommended to SWR 
in using the middle channel of those you are going to use
Anyway in the beginning of CB's all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in 
nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on so that there's not 
much point in SWRing Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it 
anyway

when heated bend to one side check out the blinker globe in your 
christmas tree lights

So when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon 
heating up and shorting out thus providing a loop to power the heaters in 
the main tube When the tube fires insufficient current runs through the 
starter to keep the heat up and the bimetalic strip straightens out 
OC

BTW I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon so one 
day when the neon in my sisters digital flip the metal squares type 
clock broke flimsy leads I replaced it with one from a starter Well 
powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock

If you are going to use one where it counts egaviation space scuttle 
etc then I suggest you go and buy a Fluke never seen a Beckman however 
for every other use you can buy a cheapie I have a metex which is some 
made up name as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it I 
bought it about  yrs ago for Aus convert that to US and you see 
that it's definetly a cheapie So far it has proved to be accurate taken 
moderate abuse and has many features on it CAP FREQTransistor check 
etc I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name Hope this helps

I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that

I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
actual purpose of those things are I hear that they're called
'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool

Except for their size the cooling towers on nuclear power plants
are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling
towers designed and built in the 's a hundred years ago for
coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways

Basicly the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when
its air is heated by hot water andor steam circulating thru a network
of pipes that fill about the lower  of the tower To assist cooling
and the draft water misters are added that spray cold water over the
hot pipes The cold water evaporates removing the heat faster than
just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is
rapidly carried away by the draft This produces the clouds frequently
seen rising out of these towers

That slight pinch maybe  of the way up the tower is there because
it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of
the air draft produced compared to a straight cylinder shape

The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam
system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the
boiler and used again The wider the temperature difference across
the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and
by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it
back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference
sometimes as high as  degrees or more from first stage hot
turbine to final stage cold turbine

Gee I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common
use in WWII so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops

 Hi  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
 paper and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
 TV screen at ths of a second  Is that possible  I thought the
 maximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was th
 of a second  or th of a second for an image composed of only odd
 or even scan lines

You are correct the fastest complete image that could be presented on
TV would be one field which is  of a second approximately  Of course
the phrase TV screen is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates  Might
even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyone's guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited

 	Do I get to live

We'll let you live but just this once

There's more to a real storage scope than just a longpersistence
phosphor  Actually the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all
what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just behind the phosphor
which becomes charged as the electron beam intially writes the trace
With the trace now written to the screen a separate lowlevel flood
electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
which are next to the written areas on the storage screen  There are
some problems with this  the resolution is limited compared to a nonstorage
tube and the stored trace tends to bloom with time 

Of course this is pretty much obsolete technology done in by the current
digital scopes which use rasterscan displays and keep everything in a
framebuffer memory anyways

Great Explaination however you left off one detail why do you always
see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water  As I recall the water isn't as hot thermodynamically in many
fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination

There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding
practices here  A few points need to be clarified

The Equipment GROUNDING conductor Green green with a yellow stripe bare or
the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods is used as a safety ground to
carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the
voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects  It
should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the
normal operating current of a connected load  Some equipment has filters in
the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding
conductor  

Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages
on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding
conductors to provide reliable operation  orange outlets are often used for
this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in
many cases back to the service  Anyone installing such a system should read
both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on
installing quiet isolated ground systems  The code requires the insulated
grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors
back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service
entrance  where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod  Many
of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide
a safe ground or a quiet ground or either 

The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit often called the NEUTRAL which is
referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be
white or natural grey  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in
most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance
panel  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper  In many household
service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which
attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel  

The Grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor  In
the case of a  volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the
circuit from the panel to the load device  

Since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding
conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance
from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but
measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load
under normal operating conditions  If you should incorrectly connect the
grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of
the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor  Since
there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also
no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end  If the load equipment
has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the U
ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential 
The difference under normal non shortcircuit conditions may be only a few
tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two  This normally does not
present a shock hazard  

HOWEVER if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact
with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator
a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to
flow through this aalternate ground path  If the contact is not solid you
will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc
Under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire  It is possible in
some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of
inadequate size causing it to overheat

With the incorrect non singlepoint grounding of the neutral if there is a
short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may
flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which
increases the possibility for shock or fire  

Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on
the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often
causing malfunction  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in
technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment

The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as
well as at the service entrance of each dwelling  This is done primarily for
lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back
to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded
objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses
quickly  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the
dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer  Some of it
flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause
corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks
and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop
between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the
water pipe and ground  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy 
don't flame ME on this I'm just telling you where the field comes from not
it's health effect as far as I'm concerned the jury is still out on this

Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel NOT at any
sub distribution panels  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service
entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have
a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral  The sheath can be used in this
application only as the groundING conductor  If the neutral is bonded to the
grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding
screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above
ground with the possible problems listed above

The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one
building to another  In the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be
used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate
wire  Every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review 
These exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days
before U ground outlets and such  The appliance manufacturers don't want to
have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don't want to
have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place
of three wire to the appliances  No question it would be safer with seperate
neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings
since most current is in the  volt hots except at some low settings the
wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage 
So far the exceptions have survived In the case of feeds between buildings
it's primarily for lightning protection

People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding
conductor  Obviously the bare wire in romex 'with ground' is  Anywhere
there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good
grounding conductor  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes
is a legal grounding conductor in the US BX has an aluminum band run under
the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath  You can just cut this
aluminum band off at the ends you don't have to bond it to anything it does
its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath Conduit or EMT thinwall
tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding
locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes  

Greenfield looks like big BX but you pull your own wires in the empty
sheath after you run it is NOT a legal grounding conductor as it doesn't have
the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and
inductance  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the
greenfield

Wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes
often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often
from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold
box  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and
the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with
 volts Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator
here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one
of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box  You must run a
ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in
the original wiring conduit BX etc where you can bond the wire to the
box with a screw bnding clip or whatever

On another issue while you should ground the green wirelug on GCFI outlets
when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the NEC to use them
without a ground if no ground is available  It is better to have the
protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't
install it  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip  It is
desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is
connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in
whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something
provides a ground path  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded
GCFI's read in the NEC  d exception This is the  code my '
code is in the city but I know the rule hasn't changed  It might be
renumbered though 

We have only touched the surface concerning grounding   there is much more
to this subject but most of you have fallen asleep by now

 As the subject says  Can I use a  for digital signals  I don't see
 why it couldn't handle digital signals but I could be wrong  Anyone have
 any advice  Thanks

Yes

I use HC and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges HC is spec'd at something like dB  MHz into 
 ohms The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive

Plain  series are not so good at handling v logic

Remember that the output load is seen by the input device

	This is a followup post to something I've written previously  Several
people responded with good information but I don't think I communicated 
exactly what I am looking for
	I'm working on a custom IO device that will communicate with a host
via RS  My custom circuitry will use an CEB or EC CPU and require
about K of RAM preferably FLASH RAM  In looking around I see that lots
of people have engineered UARTCPUROMRAM subsystems that are ready to be
interfaced to your custom IO devices  It's been done so much that it 
would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system  It just needs to use
an C or  CPU and be able to load a program from the host then 
transfer control to that program  Well there's one other thing the ROM
needs to know how to do  It should have routines to send and receive bytes
tofrom the host that utilize the hardware control lines DTRRTSDTSCTS
Everything I've seen is in the  and up range  That's too much for
this application  I need something around   The CPU has the UART
builtin so you're only looking at a few chips  Does anyone know a 
company that markets a good board in this range or some public domain 
circuitry I can use  Thanks in advance for the info

 While I'm on the net bugging everyone is there such a thing as a chip
 or chipset to decode Code  barcode  I ask for a couple of reasons 
 mainly I want a reasonably compact encoding scheme to write information
 on magstripe cards and Code  appears to be about right  If the 'right'
 way to do it is something else and it's reasonably easy can someone let
 me know

 I might not get a chance to reply too quickly to this or my earlier post
 but I'll get to them within a couple days I think 

 thanx everyone  BGB  lihanccwfccutexasedu

Hewlett Packard has a series of barcode decoder ICs HBCR HBCR
and HBCR and they support of  extended of  interleaved of  
and UPC codes The  and  pieces add codabar and code 

These chips support HP's barcode wands and slot readers

Recently I posted two oscilliscopes for sale One has sold the other is

 Hitachi V MHz DualChannel Portable Analog Oscilliscope

   o DC offset
   o alternate magnification x magnified  nonmagnified
     waveform
   o VERT mode trigger
   o TV sync separation circuit

 Sells for        JDR MicroDevices current price
                  Products International
 Your price used  obo
I haven't gotten an offer at the asking price so 'obo' applies

I also have a 'broken' version of the scope which sold
 JDR  MHz DualChannel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
   o mVdiv
   o Component Tester resistorscapsdiodescoils
   o TV video sync filter
   o zaxis input intensity modulation

'Broken' means The CRT produces a nice bright trace but the trace does
not correspond to the input signal My guess is it's repairable but more
than a simple calibration problembut I honestly have not tried to
calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it It's 'asis'
I paid  for it in its current state I bought it thinking I'd repair it
using the 'good' scope for sidebyside comparisonsince I've sold the
'good' scope the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good and I'd like to recoup
that amount As above I'll accept offers and take the best one

I'd prefer a local Bay Area California buyer so a I don't have to
ship it and b she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase

 I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that
 this board would be most appropriate
 I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
 are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
 that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
 actual purpose of those things are I hear that they're called
 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool
Great Explaination however you left off one detail why do you always
see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water  As I recall the water isn't as hot thermodynamically in many
fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination

       Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  There's a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses  vintage steam technology  So it's
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible  Hence big cooling towers  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the
way down to ambient  Some plants do cool the condensers with water
rather than air as one Canadian official asked about thermal 
pollution deicing a river said Up here we view heat as a resource  

       Everybody runs closedcycle boilers  The water used is 
purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it so the boiler water is recycled

Not hard you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software but
this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a lowend controller
I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their
 derivatives as a printer buffer with up to MB of dynamic ram
that was accessed and refreshed with software bitbanging

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller
chips that create static RAM appearance and all that but they may
be too expensive to make it worthwhile

Can circuits found in electronics magazines with no patent disclaimer

There are two issues here  copyright and patent

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted and may not be reproduced
translated etc without the copyright holder's permission  However this
does not cover the ideas expressed only the form of expression  Copying
their circuit diagram or PCboard pattern is copyright infringement  But
it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards copyright shouldn't be an issue

Patents are different  The author does not have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent although it would be sensible for
him to do so  In fact it's possible that he was infringing on someone
else's patent without realizing it  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement although it might reduce the damages
a court would award

However unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit
almost certainly it is obvious to one skilled in the art and therefore
unpatentable  Routine engineering is not patentable patents in theory
cover only inventions ideas that are genuinely new

Caution  I am not a lawyer  Consulting a professional would be wise if
significant amounts of money are at stake

I'm not up on the details of US patent law but I think this is incorrect
There is a reasonable use exemption for copyright  There is none for

is exempt but personal use is not  That is it's okay to experiment with
a patented idea but not to put it to practical use eg to improve your

could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide rowcolumnrefresh

because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts

A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent
excessive arcing during the firing  The neon reionizes but does not draw
sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself

OK what's a quick rundown on all the  series variations  We're
repairing something with a ACT on it and the question arises well
do  i really need the ACT part  Flipping through DigiKey I see 
ALS AS C HC AC ACQ ACT HCT ACHT HCTLS

Here's something I posted about this a few years ago  It's not fully
up to date with all the new variations some of which are just different
manufacturer's synonyms


In practical terms ignoring the technological details this is my view
of the families NB I am not a giant corporation which influences my
views on things like availability and backward compatibility

	The original  Speed good power consumption fair  Effectively
	obsolete now use LS or later except for a very few oddball
	functions like  which are hard to find in newer families

H	Modification of  for higher speed at the cost of higher
	power consumption  Very obsolete use F

L	Modification of  for lower power at the cost of lower speed
	Very obsolete use CMOS

S	Later modification of  for even higher speed at some cost in
	power consumption  Effectively obsolete use F

LS	Combination of L and S for speed comparable to  with lower
	power consumption  Best allround TTL now widest variety of
	devices

F	Fast as blazes power not too bad  The clear choice for high
	speed in TTL  Availability and prices generally good

AS	Failed competitor to F although a few AS parts do things
	that are hard to find in F and thus are still useful

ALS	Possible replacement for LS  Generally souped up  Still fairly
	new availability and prices possibly a problem

C	Fairly old family CMOS devices with TTL pinouts  Competed with
	 series not too successfully  Obsolete use  or newer
	CMOS  families

	Thrown in as the major non nonECL logic family  The old CMOS
	family still viable because of very wide range of devices low
	power consumption and wide range of supply voltages  Not fast
	Very forgiving and easy to work with beware static electricity
	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too
	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other  The
	clear choice when speed is not important

HC	A new attempt at pinout CMOS  Fast compared to old CMOS power
	consumption often lower than TTL  Possibly a good choice for
	generalpurpose logic assuming availability and affordability
	CMOS logic levels not TTL ones  Beware very limited range of
	supply voltages compared to older CMOS also major rise of power
	consumption at faster speeds

HCT	HC with TTL logic levels  Much the same comments as HC  Read
	the fine print on things like power consumption  TTL compatibility
	in CMOS involves some compromises

K	Thrown in for speed freaks  The low end of ECL  Various sources
	claim that it is easier to work with than superfast TTL for
	serious highspeed work  Less forgiving though  read and follow
	the rules or it won't work  Availability to hobbyists limited
	can be expensive

K	For real speed freaks  Hot ECL  Harder to handle than K and
	inconvenient packages  Much more useful datasheets however

As for compatibility between families  the  families except C and
HC are all more or less logiclevel compatible but how many X devices
you can drive from one Y output varies enormously with X and Y  You just
have to read the specs and do the arithmetic  C and HC are compatible
with the others with a bit of hassle   compatibility can be a bit of
hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage  is using
K or K to anything else is considerable hassle

Me  I use  and LS with a sprinkling of F  HCT and K are
interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet

I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
actual purpose of those things are I hear that they're called
'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool
I hope someone can help 


The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft
exploiting the venturi effect  Around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers  Warm river water coming from the steam condenser
in the plant is sprayed over louvres  The draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection  The
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation

It should be noted that the hourglassshaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants  It should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful the cooling towers are only used part
time when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit
It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish
Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect  Nontheless stringent
usually state regulations remain in some instances  Since it typically
takes  hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a  MWe plant the cost of using the towers is not insignificant

 You are experiencing what is called Macrovision  It is the protection 
 that they use on the video tapes  There are two ways around this that I 
 know of  First of all you can try using a different VCR to copy onto
 It is the input of the VCR that reacts to the protection so sometimes 
 just switching the two VCRs around will take care of it  Some models 
 just don't react to it
 
 Does this also affect the viewing of tapes  I have had problems with
 a couple of rented tapes they were virtually unviewable I fiddled 
 with the tuning tracking and vertical hold but it was no good
 


It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
protection  Poor you

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you 
souldn't have any more problems  However if you use the method of 
copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to 
the protection you will end up with a duplicate tape including the 
protection

One thought comes to mind about your problem  When playing the tape 
for viewing are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an 
extra device before going to the TV  If you feed it through a second VCR 
first that is your problem  As to other devices such as converters I 
don't know if they would react or not  Just to be safe you might want 
to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV

        Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
 boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  There's a gripe in the industry
 that nuclear power uses  vintage steam technology  So it's
 more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
 as cold as possible  Hence big cooling towers  

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci OH plant Zimmer and
announced they were going to convert it to a coalfired scheme the
turbines were already in place and they were the lowtemp type So the
plan was Install a SECOND set of high temp turbines and feed the
lowtemp ones with the output of the new ones

Never saw anything more on this Did they ever really build it

During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day

Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be Power companies
are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
raw uranium emisions to be held to under  This law is now under attack
by lawyers arguing that the  should be measured at the edge of the property
rather than the edge of the cooling tower Eliminating this law will save
power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes

I think you posted your article  days too late  April st is over
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
storys about them OK 
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to
   st Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steamengine
         It has an hightech boiler but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional And if you've already visited any condensation
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the CARNOTprocess which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference  And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too  You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox  of the 
         energy you or better the uranium brought into the water to
         let it boil If you only have hot steam on the one and cold
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the  of
         energy that carnot will give them
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam 
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation
         because that steam is radioactive  The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST  circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment 
         
   nd OK the main core IS hot but even in the modernst HighTemperature
         Reactors HTR they only run at  deg celsius This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around  deg celsius  But you'll have lot's of problems with
         the boiler's steel That's because at this temperature the
         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast
         This is only for BWR's The new He cooled reactors have temperatures
         up to  deg celsius But this is only experimental 

   rd I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
         years Today  mRem and next year  mRem won't be  mRem
         at all It accumulates and even in  years you'll still have
          mRem And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and
         getting children with  heads This is my point of view

to lower it via a resistor  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the v wire in one hand and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage  A m resistor 
only lowers voltage by v so this is not too feesable

Well it looks as if DigiKey sells a chip with the number ICL that does what

There usually is a way however often telephone companies like to
keep all of their internal numbers private Depends on your exchange
Any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth
lines that echo the number you called from The line service guys use this
to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines

A side effect of this deficitreduction program is that they provide

What you CAN do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  In fact
depending on where you are putting your new outlets a GFCI may be required
 
 You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter

Not according to the NEC nor the CEC as explained in the electrical wiring 
FAQ which I posted here separately  Note the material under the headings

and

 Subject Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets
 	Should the test button work

Of course as they said  Local codes may vary 

 So rewiring is still a part of this job however the ground may be connected to
 a local earth ground rather than back at the breaker box

I'm not sure about this  If the ground connections on the outlets are
connected to anything they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the
main panel where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground
rod  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of
the goals of the ground wire which is that if a short develops from hot
to the ground wire enough current would flow to trip the breaker  

Hmmm  How are those orange isolated ground outlets often used in
computer rooms wired

A couple of weeks ago I was asking for a public domain schematic editor
which is compatible with SPICE and runs under X

I got several emails and therefore I wrote this summary

It seems that there are two public domain tools available

The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at  
hobiecatcaltechedu or
in europe at ifiuiono In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool 
schematic editor layout editor LVS DRC The schematic editor  
itself is
called LOG

The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS' It is also a complete VLSI
package The fully uncompressed release takes about Mb of disk space  
It
should be available at Berkley

That's all I got so far

Great Explaination however you left off one detail why do you always
see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water  As I recall the water isn't as hot thermodynamically in many
fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are
 fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than
nuclear plants   MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many
fossil plants were built  The average nuclear plant is  MWe   many
fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were
adopted why those old dirt burners can't harm anything let 'em go  
 powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally
not visible from offsite are quite popular with fossil plants   fossil
plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears

       Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  There's a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses  vintage steam technology  So it's
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible  Hence big cooling towers  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the
way down to ambient  Some plants do cool the condensers with water
rather than air as one Canadian official asked about thermal 
pollution deicing a river said Up here we view heat as a resource  

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants
of similar size  The issues are the same regardless of where the 
heat comes from  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in
order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine  The condenser pressure is
normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature  It is
desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because 
moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine 
low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity
causes erosion of the condenser tubes  The coldest and thus lowest
pressure condensing environment is always the best  

A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where
the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes  Since the
condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the 
condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity  If the condensate is too 
hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into
steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate  This is a
particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all
costs  

The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant
in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps  How much lower 
they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in
the hotwell  Typically hotwell temperatures run between  and  
degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is
used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower
system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water
is pumped  When the river water temperature is high in the summer
operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order 
to provide more gravity head  There is a tradeoff involved since higher
hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the
condenser area

At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the
air  the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge
water from the cooling towers  The temperature of the discharge water
from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and
humidity  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water
temperatures exceeding  degrees  A vast difference from the typical
 days  degrees  humidity we see routinely in the East
It is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful
in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the
plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets
too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive
pressure

       Everybody runs closedcycle boilers  The water used is 
purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it so the boiler water is recycled

True  Actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and
feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard 
stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves
The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood
the costs of impure water  By impure I mean water with a few
dozen extra micromho of conductivity andor a few PPM of dissolved
oxygen  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will 
find outside the laboratory

 Sorry  The unit for current is the AMPERE which is the name of a frenchman
 named AMPERE who studied electrical current  The term AMP is just an abbreviation
 of it  The company AMP came after the AMPERE unit was already in use
   
  The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus
  our use of the Ohms
 
 I don't know about this one but it doesn't sound right

 CT just recently overturned the ban on radar detectors it is no

 when it WAS illegal it was illegal to operate a radar detector or
 have a radar detector installed in your vehicle  If a cop pulled you
 over and you either had your detector on operating or had your
 detector off but plugged in to a power source installed the cop
 could sieze your detector and you could get it back something like 
 year and about  later not  sure about timefines

The fine was  and they could not seize your detector

 I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast
   or whereever  But if you look in the amp and see what components
   they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the
   amplifiers sound so brilliant

 Good pointalso I wouldn't be surprised that the components
 they use offshore are of inferior quality  As long as it was
 properly designed and robust premium components are used it
 shouldn't matter where it is assembled

Definately I agree wholeheartedly  If they can build the amp where
  the labour is not so expensive they can afford to put decent
  components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the
  amplifier  as Adcom has done

 I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last  not with
   those quality components inside  Sure the amp runs very fairly
   hot  but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good

 An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound
 The amp you have probably is running ClassA the whole day

 Actually I'd be wary of excessively hot amps 'cauz even though
 the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive 
 heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component
 regardless of quality  In fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is
 because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
 to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  Hmmmmm

Sure I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated the
  amp sounds good  My Adcom GFP II runs fairly warm  not hot to
  the touch  but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely
I don't like it when an amp runs deadcold  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing 
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy  they're massive things with heating vents both below
  and above  More than enough to carry away excessive heat

My opinions once again

GECPlessey specify a series of FM demodulators SL etc for use in

I think there's also a related data slicer  clock recovery circuit intended
for use in DMAC decoders though that isn't used in the most common

The most easily available components probably vary with local satellite

spread from one edge or else they'd come adrift from those

  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it onoff with a lead stuck in the amps jack  a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans anyway

I also need to be able to power up this same PC through the use of an external

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the

than a conventional phonograph  It tended to wear the disks out
pretty quickly though

This was the Pathe you are thinking of although there were other imitators
It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs but
it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air
There are a lot of them still operating and they are pretty ingenious

There was a pneumatic amplifier designed by Alexander Graham Bell as well

 Hi  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
 paper and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
 TV screen at ths of a second  Is that possible  I thought the
 maximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was th
 of a second  or th of a second for an image composed of only odd
 or even scan lines

You are correct the fastest complete image that could be presented on
TV would be one field which is  of a second approximately  Of course
the phrase TV screen is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates  Might
even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyone's guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited

Actually a lot of this work used to be done with a CRT that had a beamsplitter
mounted in front and a tachistoscope driving it  The tachistoscope is really
just a slide projector with a very fast shutter  Low tech but it does the job

I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option
known as differential ready  Apparently landbased
beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS 
receiver with differential option installed

How does this system work  What frequency is used for
the landbased beacons

Thanks in advance

Charlie Thompson


Here's a rough sketch of how the system works  A reference station
with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
incoming GPS signals  These errors are due to several factors
including atmospheric distortion SA Selective Availability time
dithering etc  The reference unit contains complex computational 
equipment to back out the errors in its position since it knows
where it is already  It then transmits these corrections on a 
broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
receivers  If the receivers are nearby km and are using
the same satellites as the reference unit the errors should be very
similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit  Thus the
receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
unit

The US Coast Guard is currently as far as I know installing a series
of coastline transmitters for differential GPS  These stations will
use existing radio towers  I believe the frequency is to be approximately
 kHz  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals
on different frequencies  For example PinPoint  offers
correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system
which has stations all across the US

The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM  format
Advertised accuracies espouse  to  meter errors

Some weeks ago someone posted an article telling when and where
a hamfest and computerfest was going to be help in Dayton OH
Unfortunately I lost the article and I was wondering if someone
could repost it

I believe it was being held the and  of this month at
the Dayton convention center but I'm not sure

Any help and more details would be greatly appreciated

 My monitor display has a bad case of the wigglies I have a good ground I
 live in an old house and I have replaced much of the wiring I have two
 EMI filters on the computer the monitor plugs into the computer When
 fluorescent lights are on upstairs the display jiggles when motors run
 in the house the display jiggles when incandescent lights are on in the
 kitchen the display jiggles  I could bring a separate line from the
 breaker box and use it only for the computer would this do it EMI
 doesn't only travel the  volt line though Should I shield the back of
 the monitor Ground a grid or plate 
 Your expertise is appreciated Thanks very much  Ed Byrnes


Aaahh a problem very near and dear to my heart In our case other
monitors cause this problem  the deflection coil of other monitors to be
specific Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this
problem This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites motors etc
several s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it but the
juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor Fusebox on other side
of wall maybe
We started spec'ing Panasonic CTY video monitors  switchable input
linesvid  aud SVHS on one  This stopped the wavy interference
effect on the computer monitor next to it 
Now on to your problem You need what is known as mu shielding very
common in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type
O'scopes
I talked to a EE prof He said get a coffee can cut both ends off mount
around deflection coil of interfering monitor 
BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH
VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED IF YOU KILL YOURSELF DON'T
BLAMESUE ME USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NONCONDUCTING STANDOFFS AND SUCH TO
MOUNT CAN
Now I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also
good at keeping them out so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on
monitor being interfered with as well If not start shielding those other
sources

  Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing
all over latenight TV recently I was wondering if they use forced air heat
or both If there's heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at
My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay  for a box a fan
and a heater Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks Heck the technology is only what  years old

My question is

	Is there a good relayrelay circuit that I can use for switching

a galvanized bucket for the zinc and a copper toilet tank float  The

you might never run into them in practice

Since your MOSFET is a  vintage it's probably not a very good one by 
today's standards  If you have an idea about its voltage and current 
ratings eg VDC  A you can probably get away with replacing it with 
anything with better specs  Early MOSFETS had a gatesource voltage rating 
of approximately   VDCmax and they would usually turn completely ON 
at VDC  Otherwise MOSFETS are not really mysterious  they're more or 
less voltage controlled current sources  If the MOSFET in your circuit is 
used as an openloop voltage controlled current source you may have to 
experiment with various gainaltering techniques

I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few 
questions about low level noise  I have noticed that the waveform 
synthesizer that I am using Analogic  has some relatively large
common mode noise on it  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another
transient waveform and am amplifying the difference uV several hundred 
times  The  has about  mVpp of common mode noise and this tends to
make my measurements hard to repeat  The noise is not quite in sync with 
line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component is about Hz

How can I get rid of the noise  When I look at the spectrum using an
HP A audio range analyzer the noise goes away the minute I switch to 
'isolation' on the input  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the 
input since it will read accurately down to DC

Also if I use a differential amplifier IA to solve the problem 
how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' an amp connected 
to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused 
by different cable capacitances  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for 
use with transient signals with content from KHz to about KHz I would
appreciate it

    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles
on your electronic odometer with an oscillator

    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this  Not because the engineers at BMW are
putting in antifraud logic but just because an automobile is a noisy hostile
environment for electronics and I would expect the software to be conservative

   If I were to design a microprocessorbased odometerspeedometer program
it would have the following features  just off the top of my head 

          Debouncingdeglitching   Is this a real pulse or just a glitch 
          Smoothing  The rateofchange of speed cannot be too high
                                This is a car not an electron
           Top speed limit  Anything above MPH is ridiculous must be
                                        electrical noise or contact bounce

    As for getting in and presetting the pins  if this is the circuit board out of
a BMW dashboard I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the
middle of the card  Good luck getting at the counter 

    I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter  remember it's
probably damped so it can't move too fast and is probably protected  After all
a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics  there used to be an
app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this
in good detail

Greetings
      
        Situation  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall  I don't
                    know the number of the line  And I don't want
                    to call up the operator to place a trace on it

        Question   Is there a certain device out there that I can
                    use to find out the number to the line
        Thanks for any response
                                                    Al

There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
voice telling you the number of the line  Unfortunately for the
life of me I can't remember what it is The telephone technicians
use it all the time  We used to play around with this in our
dorm rooms since there were multiple phone lines running between
rooms

sorry

HI I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
subjects I am currently learning about AMFM receivers and recieving
circuits I understand a lot of things but a few things I am confused
abuot The first is the MIXER to mix the RF and local oscillator
frequencies to make the IF Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams as
simple as possible for this kind of mixer I have come across a
MCSBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs
ACTIVEetc 

Along the same note are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone
may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see

PS any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AMFM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot
I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
circuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help

				Thanks

I am in the midst of designing a project which requires two motors and an LED
illuminator driven with Pulsewidth modulation  I'm using the  and
I understand that the FB version has a programmable counter array that can
essentially be set and forgotten to do the PWM  The problems is that variant
is difficult to come by  I need two or three of the D prefix ceramic window
version for development and then lots of the P prefix plastic OTP for later
production  I've tried Avnet Arrow and Pioneer  They might have them but
I'm looking for samples at this point and they're not too willing to provide
them  I would buy them but these vendors have  minimums

Any help is appreciated

I haven't been following this so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  
this but you could grab a lemon I think potatoes work too but I'm not  
sure a strip of copper and a strip of zinc I think you can get the  
metal in a hardware store or hobby shop maybe  Stick the strips in  
the lemon so they don't touch and you'll get a measurable voltage not  
a lot but hey it's a lemon     As I recall we had to hook  
something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
current because of the mondo internal resistance but if you just need a  
demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something

I will appreciate any advice or references to advice  Also exact part

Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like preamp
out level signals  Also are the clicks you mentioning the big
clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact
bounce  How are you driving the relays  TTL gate output  Switching

Yes I know it sounds crazy Call it an urge Call it what you want

Anyway I'd like to build a UV flashlight cheaply flashlight means
it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if
necessary

My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they
need a lot of power etc etc

I'm not too concerned with whether it's longwave or shortwave
but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs I'll take both

One other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about nearUV
light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light Does anyone
know what he was referring to

I've got the same problem I can't dig up any info on the jumper settings
on the hd  drives

Can anyone recommend a reference books on the subject rather than a
quick fix type answer  I was going to start hooking up things and
logging the results but the prospect of a ten second smoke test deters
me

Thanks Kirk Cowen

 I don't know why my FPU has an XC my original MHz FPU
was label MC but it seems to work fine on my system
PS Or does it mean eXperimental Chip instead of Motorola Chip 

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC that means it works
exactly the way the datasheetbook specifies  If it says XC that means
there is at least one known bug  Often these bugs are small and obscure
you might never run into them in practice


XC units are often preproduction sample devices  Those are normally
distributed for evaluation as freebies and are not guaranteed to
meet every spec

At least Motorola admits it unlike certain other companies

Yep that's for surethat's one thing I like most about Motorola

Just a thoughtMaybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it
IS an Emerson  I've got an Emerson VCR which is  in the series  Returned
it six times for various and never the same problems  Got tired of taking it 
back and fixed it myself  The HiFi window was a bit off  Something like
the HiFi audio finetuning  When I was a WalMart associate in ''
we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY  How's that for
reliability  Face itEmerson can make audio stuff albeit not of premium
quality but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with 
reliability IMHO  Please no flames  Just had to share my Emerson disaster
in the light of this exploding tv

 Well this is my second try at posting on this subject Here goes
         In Texas Corpus Christi at least if you pick up the phone and
 dial
          the phone company will read the number of the phone you are on
         back to you I believe the service department uses this to make
         certain they are repairing the correct lines when they open the BIG
         junction boxes I don't know if it will work but you can give it a
         try Good luck



Where I live I use BCTEL The number to dial is  for the same result

Hi

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt I find myself needing to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp So 
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'

	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits No
Not PIE Just how it relates to one of the following

	Ai Current Gain
	Av Voltage Gain
	Ap Power Gain
	or whatever

I already have a wonderful cheap IE  schematic for a W amp but
I would like to Crossimprove the circuit The problem is that the parts
list has IC and IC as NECAB amplifiers They look like  pin 
SIP packages with a heatsink This schematic was published in a  mag
so it may be nonexistant now Anyway I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digikey Cat and found it  not listed  The closes I could
figure was a  pin SIP as TDABU Anyone got any Ideas 

	I thought hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using  opamp 
models Yea great It worked But I guess the  wasn't made for High
power amps As a result I got a Voltage gain of mVV Worse than
I started with  Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
Email Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me 

I'm open to SuggestionsIdeasCommentsHelp
Please Email since I have little time to search the News 
And I'll post if there's and interest

gstovallcrchhNoSubdomainNoDomain Greg Stovall writes
Anyway over the weekend I was resting on the sofa in between chores
and noticed that I briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic
over my stereo and television even though both were off  Also all the
touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko cycling through 
their four brightness states

I presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past
my house I live on a busy thoroughfare would this be a correct presumption
What kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects  
The affected equipment is about  feet from the road

Hams can legally run up to  watts  It is very unlikely however
that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  Ham rigs
for cars put out around  watts  It is possible that a  watt
radio would cause interference to consumer electronic  feet 
away  Most TVs stereos and VCRs have very poor RF shielding
If you experience the problem frequently it may be 
caused by a ham CBer or other radio operator in a base station
nearby    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
transmitter used for other purposes such as police fire
etc  If you heard voices over your stereo I think you are
correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter

If you have frequent trouble you may want to try the RF ferrite
chokes available at Radio Shack  The interference is probably
being picked up by your speaker wires and those chokes can
be installed on the wires very easily without cutting them
Good instructions are included with the chokes
If that does not solve the problem you may want to search your
neighborhood for a radio operator  Look for antennas on the roof
or car  Talk to himher about your problem  There are things
a radio operator can do to reduce interference

The board itself is also identical with room for all three caps The

How does that make sense  is  essentially  for caps

I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from
a MCA Real Time Clock  Has anyone out there had some experience
in doing this  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before
standby mode is activated and are a bit hard to decipher on that but
I thought that I had it worked out  However with a kHz crystal the
lowest current drain I can acheive at V Vcc is uA  This is
three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting
to create

I have done the following things

 Made sure that RESET is asserted for Trlh after powerup and AS is
   low during this time


 Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD or
   WR during which STBY was asserted

What am I doing wrong

Thanks very much

   What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
 turn it onoff with a lead stuck in the amps jack  a little bit of
 clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
 safer for electricans anyway
    Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
 circuit no not menot more than a dozen times anyway

The Fluke  beeps at you if you try to take it out of a current measuring
range while there is still a lead plugged in to the current sense socket

 this should solve your problem  unless you are in a noisy environment

The Fujitsu  uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface Storage Module
Device  A lot of older minis used it  Sun still does on their server
models  There are several different speeds of SMD and I think that the 
Fuji drive you have is rated at about  Mbsec thats megabits  There
used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC Interphase in
Texas being one but I think that the market pretty much has dried up
Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses
though  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available but
I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices  In other words
if you have a PC or Mac that drive is pretty much dogmeat

Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack  If not
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
box If you do get a dial tone then surely the telco is sending a bill
for the line to someplace or somebody Are you sure that what you
are doing is on the level Sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
at somebody's unlisted number  Fess up

Hi all

I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus  I'd
like to expand our show automation a bit namely add the capability to
use cue tapes to bring the houselights up  Our current automation
consoles date from the early 's and don't provide this function

We already have the combo failsafecontact rollers to read the cuetapes
and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fadeup control
circuit  VAC is momentarily closed for at least  second

I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a V relay activated when the
cue tape completes the circuit  Low tech and simple but there's one
problem  In order to get the  second pulse there needs to be
a shload of cuetape on the film  mm runs at  feet per minute
so to get a  second pulse there needs to be at least  inches of solid
cuetape

Ideally I would like to use a single crosscue to accomplish this function
A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film
This would give a pulse of approximately  of a second
What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay
for around  second  The ability to adjust how long the relay
is activated would be nice  I figure this would require an RC circuit
of some sort  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured
out in your heads  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated


Thanks

 all over latenight TV recently I was wondering if they use forced air heat
 or both If there's heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at
 My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay  for a box a fan

 for just a few bucks Heck the technology is only what  years old

The board itself is also identical with room for all three caps The
USCan versions is clearly indicated in both places

How does that make sense  is  essentially  for caps
there are just standard caps no special Wtypeprecision 

Please explain this
 Michael Golan

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage Sometimes two elco's in antiseries
you know positive sides facing eachother are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well

So there probably is no designphilosophical reason but a productioncost
one

What do you mean by police band  there is no such thing

Anyway radar detectors work in shared bands
If you applied your test all of those radar operated door

One of the great problems here is that there are too many

I built a little project using the radio shack vdc relays to switch
audio  I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched  I was doing
most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and
nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks


My question is

	Is there a good relayrelay circuit that I can use for switching
audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio lines


I will appreciate any advice or references to advice  Also exact part
numberscompany names etc for the relays will help
 
 Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like preamp
 out level signals  Also are the clicks you mentioning the big
 clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact
 bounce  How are you driving the relays  TTL gate output  Switching
 transistor  How are the relays connected to what you are driving
 
 Need more specifics to answer your question 

As a general rule no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
the circuit with the contacts  The noise you hear is due to the momentary
opening and closing of the path

The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit  In high
impedance audio circuits a resistive T is constructed close to characteristic
impedance of the circuit  Grounding the imputs connected to the T transfers
the audio

In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used and the inputs are
shorted out or grounded  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
impedance

Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio a second contact is used
to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time

Telephone relays are handy because contacts can be adjusted to Make before
break and Vica Versa but I haven't seen any of these for years

Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps etc

A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive optical isolator It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp all packaged in a tube  When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
passing the audio  Once again this device in a T switches the audio  Varying
the lamp resistance give a remote volume control  Use  variable resisters and
you have a mixer

Lots of luck

You can get a little UV by putting a heavy UV filter deep purple in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb the brightest you can get
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 

Good UV blacklight bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs  I'd proceed by
getting a cheap batterypowered fluorescent light then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it

I had a similar idea for a faxanswering machine switch
to put both machines on one line  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company  This is month here
You get a second unpublished phone number  When
someone calls this number your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings

You set up your answering machine on  rings and your fax
on six rings  You'd give out the new  as your fax 
A device would measure the length of rings  When it
detects a short ring it turns off your answering machine
Five rings later your fax picks up the call

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the 
switches now available

But that's not what I did  I'm giving out the new

I've had my Fluke A here at work for just over  years now
It is a wonderful meter  Several colleagues here have some of the
newer Fluke meters though I still would just as soon hang on to my
  The  a is the s digial analog to the Simpson 
analog DMM of the s  There wasis  an B that had
extended frequency response

I've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep
in my toolbox at home  I've had that for six or seven years now
and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees it is more than
adequate for daytoday hobby use  I think Soar OEMs their stuff
for a number of vendors  Some of JDR Microdevices' stuff looks
rather similar to Soar's

Yes you increase the RPM slip of a boxer type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply  The air flow of
small  inch fans can be reduced by about  by using a  to 
uF capacitor  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around  volts  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application

For DC powered applications try the Radio Shack  volt box fan
It can run and start reliably from as low as about  VDC  It is
exceptionally quiet but at admittedly low flow  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack

It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business 
or for an illegal use  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or
police monitors are essentially making the claim that there is no
other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor 

The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed
The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts
have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction
and sometimes they have not  A lot of state courts do not have
enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides
avoiding law enforcement action for speeding

When you buy a radar detector amongst the guarrantees instructions 
explanations and other detritus is an invitation to join an
association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector
I promise I am not making this up

I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any 
headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed 
laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund
raiser aspect of tickets

Subject Need help with video detection circuit
MessageID Aprjacksnscom
Organization Systems'n'Software
Date Tue  Apr   GMT

I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video Vs
a blank screen by monitoring the RG and B outputs of a graphics
card  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
 MHz which would mean detecting a  NS pulse  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen about  mv
and a dim screen say around  mv  Oh yes it also needs to be
cheap  

My first circuit was a dismal failure  I used  compariators each
compariator had the  input going to one of the guns the  input
went to a reference created by a voltage dividera potentiometer

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators so I could have a whole screen full of text but my
circuit would not detect it   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only  mv  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work  

There are faster compariators but they are expensive and require 
split supplies   I would need to replace my  quad compariator
with three  compariators and create a whole new power supply
circuit  

At this point I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick

Unfortunately I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits so I am appealing to the net for help  Any
ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly
appreciated  

Oh yes I only sample the output of this thing every second or so so
I don't need a fast response time at all however I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give Of course
you will have my undying gratitude

I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about  meters more is better in
daylight  The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward
 KHz square wave with  duty cycle

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc to give
information to a pantilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LEDs
possibly an Optek OP or Motorola MLED  Wazing would mean at least  Amp
current pulses  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to  and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the  required

Has anyone done something like this

   Anyway over the weekend I was resting on the sofa in between chores
   and noticed that I briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic
   over my stereo and television even though both were off  Also all the
   touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko cycling through 
   their four brightness states

   I presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past
   my house I live on a busy thoroughfare would this be a correct presumption
   What kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects  
   The affected equipment is about  feet from the road

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp  and are also unlikely to
have a dirty amp

   Hams can legally run up to  watts  It is very unlikely however
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  Ham rigs

Not possible either  You'd need about a  amp alternator for
just the amplifier  I can just see it  You need to slow
down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button

   for cars put out around  watts  It is possible that a  watt
   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic  feet 
   away  Most TVs stereos and VCRs have very poor RF shielding
   If you experience the problem frequently it may be 
   caused by a ham CBer or other radio operator in a base station
   nearby    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
   transmitter used for other purposes such as police fire
   etc  If you heard voices over your stereo I think you are
   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter

   If you have frequent trouble you may want to try the RF ferrite
   chokes available at Radio Shack  The interference is probably
   being picked up by your speaker wires and those chokes can
   be installed on the wires very easily without cutting them
   Good instructions are included with the chokes
   If that does not solve the problem you may want to search your
   neighborhood for a radio operator  Look for antennas on the roof
   or car  Talk to himher about your problem  There are things
   a radio operator can do to reduce interference

And please remember to be friendly when approaching your
local radio operator  This person may or may not be the 
cause of your troubles  and you'll get better cooperation
and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful most
are  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes
dealt with as I grew up  We were blamed for skip ghost
pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks  cb
interferance  dead grass   you name it  

BTW the local operator should try and help you whether or
not he or she is directly responsible  It is part of
being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it
Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers
to take any precautions

Last you can usually tell ham radio vs CB  Ham operators are
required to declare their call sign every so many minutes no more
than   So if you hear This is WAQT or some other call starting
with A W or K and no more than  total characters you heard a ham
CB'ers probably won't sign I don't know that they're even required
to and firepolice have other private ids

 PS any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AMFM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
 ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot
 I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
 circuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations the MiniCircuits
part you mention is a doublybalanced diode mixer but active ones
BJT FET seem more popular in consumer receivers  You might
call MCL they have a nice catalog

The universal answer for widecoverage theorypractice RF design
is the ARRL Handbook published by the American Radio Relay
League the radio amateur organization  Any technical bookstore
can order you one  The book is superb with lots of accessible
theory construction projects and generally interesting stuff

You might also check out Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur
I think by Hayward and someone  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit whereas LaserJets given halfway decent
toner like HP's Microfine stuff don't  Both produce very good output
but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet
output is definitely superior  

On the other hand LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use
the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output much
worse than a bubblejet 

One other thing there are bubblejets and then there are BubbleJets
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet whereas most produce really good
looking output such as HP's DeskJets  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets

					Joel Kolstad

PS  If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet although I've heard the portable
Canons are good too I needed PCL support myself  With the DeskJet
Portable you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot

I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about  meters more is better in
daylight  The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward
 KHz square wave with  duty cycle

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc to give
information to a pantilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LEDs
possibly an Optek OP or Motorola MLED  Wazing would mean at least  Amp
current pulses  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to  and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the  required

Has anyone done something like this

A method which will directly almost provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks eg the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB Sweden and the
WATSMART System   These use lateral photoeffect detectors Lindholm and
Oberg  Woltring and Marsolais  to determine the position of a
spot of light projected using a camera lens over its surface  In escence
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal and a single anode the back of
the crystal  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detector's face  Let's try some ASCII
graphics in D so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position



               
                                    
                                           
              cathode                   
           XXXXX

           XXXXX                                         
           XXXXX                                    
           XXXXX                                 
           XXXXX          gnd             
           XXXXX                         
           XXXXX anode              
           XXXXX                     
            cathode            
                                    
                                    
              

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina
tion the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light then the way of
tuning to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and D lateral photoeffect detectors and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics  The readymade
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pantilt system until you reach zero difference

preferable it would be rs addressable

	Uh oh
	Umm there are a number of copy protection schemes  Some involve
modifying the physical media and some involve encryption schemes c
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time  I recall however near monthly releases of new
ways to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest releases  The fact
is none of them are completely secure or anywhere near it  Some are more or
less difficult to crack and some have already been cracked
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult if not
impossible to answer  What exactly do you want to know  Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on  How secure must it be  Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used  I can probably make suggestions
assuming the activity is strictly legal  In general it is a BAD idea
legally to tamper with copy protection  It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of being as they are copy
protected which can be devestating  Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications and are merely curious
	Please clear up those questions and I'll try to help as much as I
can

	Incidentally the Uh oh at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack  The area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers many of which include breaking the law or at least addressing it

Blue lights Ultraviolet by definition goes from the blue end of the
spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum Xrays cosmic rays etc

possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility which people
with false eyelenses can see easily since it's your lenses that soak up
most of the UV however since most people use UV to get other things

work as well if it worked at all lecture on basic atomic physics

   Hams can legally run up to  watts  It is very unlikely however
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  Ham rigs

Not possible either  You'd need about a  amp alternator for
just the amplifier  I can just see it  You need to slow
down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button

Now that indeed is possible  A good friend of mine is running about  KW
PeP from his car  Yes he does have a second alternator  Yes he calls
the rig an electronic brake since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down

My car unfortunately has so much computer junk under the hood that it's
astonishingly sensitive to RFI  If I key a W HT over the engine with
the hood open the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the 
distributor pickup  Very poor design

I will however point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing
to help when interference is detected  Remember that any interference is
wasted power if I put out W in the TV band that's W that I am not putting
out in the band I am trying to transmit on and W can often be the difference
between a nice card hanging on the wall and nothing  CBers however are
usually not as helpful  Most illegal CBers however will stop operation
when you inform them of a problem  The rest of them will stop operation when
you inform the local FCC office of the problem in writing and giving details
and addresses

Last you can usually tell ham radio vs CB  Ham operators are
required to declare their call sign every so many minutes no more
than   So if you hear This is WAQT or some other call starting
with A W or K and no more than  total characters you heard a ham
CB'ers probably won't sign I don't know that they're even required
to and firepolice have other private ids

Good advice  Hams will frequently give their call and will never use
a handle  They are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well
but that's not to say that they don't from time to time

     Hello 

   Let me introduce a problem

   When I measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter using 
AC mode my output is an rms value a peak value over  squared  Right  
   When I measure a square wave in the same mode AC my output is equal 
to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave
   I assumed that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
input value and divides it over the wave period  Right
   Now I used it to measure the same  square wave as above but distorted 
by highfrequency harmonics Ideally output should be the same but
The output value was only about  of the previous one 
   Why What is the nature of this output value What does the voltmeter 
actually measure And what does it show  

   Related question less important to me
   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
analog ones 

   Thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at
avmzeustamuedu or open a discussion here I would appreciate either 
way

One of the easiest and really very used ways of copyprotection is to mark 
a specific sector on the installation disk bad This is very easy to get 
around though if you have any knowledge of hwhacking but most 'normal'

I don't want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other
postings near UV light is actual UV light  The near means that
it is close to the visible spectrum ie of relatively long wavelength
not that it is nearly UV  I'm sure you can figure out now just what
far UV is

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source  Stronger sources are
going to require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tubes such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor  Be careful though strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage especially to the eyes  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source  It would be bright enough to
be useful but not dangerously so

 Could someone please tell me if a  decoder is the same as a  to

 				 Thanx
 					Taro Ogawa

A  of  decoder need not be the same as a  to  demultiplexer although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such Strictly
a  of  decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state according to the inputs

A demux on the other hand uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal So there are
three inputs required

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input since this can be used as the data input eg when high all
outputs are high when low only the selected by control inputs output
will be low

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit bit  to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux since
you have no data input the enable line on a four way decoder left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four fourway decoders plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time Therefore use
the fifth decoder attached to the two high order bits to provide the
four enable lines

Of course the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework

stepper  What sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved a 
small schematic would probably be helpfull  
        Also I've looked into the TIPCN by TI and I was wondering 
if I should use the same suggested by you replying to this message 
current limiting circuitry on each of the  mosfets in the package as 
that illustrated in the schematic which you the replyer would hopefully 
help me with

Suppose we have a boolean function which is a minimal sumofproducts
derived from a Kmap or something like this

fabcd  bc'd'  acd'  abc'  ab'c

The books on logic design I have consulted all seem to imply that this
is where the analysis ends    But by factoring out the
a' term in the function we can get fewer gates

fabcd  bc'd'  acd'  bc'  b'c

which yields  gates 

	Yes but the minimization of gates is important in part
because of TIMING considerations  A TTL gate has the basic structure
of ANDORINVERT and an inversion of a sum of a product is just
exactly ONE gate delay  The reason to find a minimal sum of products
is that this matches a hardware optimization

	A positiveOR gate such as the gate solution uses has
TWO gate delays and there's another gate delay in the second term
so that the second solution while simpler in logic symbols can 
be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world
ECL is similar to TTL in that it can support an ORAND
gate with the minimum delay unlike TTL you get both true and
inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL

	PALs are basically large programmable ANDORINVERT
gates with your choice of internal connections between the
various sections and perhaps some latches so a minimum sum
of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into 
a few PALs  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization
of logic gates but some software packages claim to allow you to
do so and will take just about any mess of gates as a nodelist
with xxx series logic ICs and produce a description of
a logic cell array to do the same job  Xilinx's XACT software
does this by treating each logic block as a macro and expanding
it all out then simplifying

      Hello 
 
    Let me introduce a problem
 
    When I measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter using 
 AC mode my output is an rms value a peak value over  squared  Right  
    When I measure a square wave in the same mode AC my output is equal 
 to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave
    I assumed that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
 input value and divides it over the wave period  Right
    Now I used it to measure the same  square wave as above but distorted 
 by highfrequency harmonics Ideally output should be the same but
 The output value was only about  of the previous one 
    Why What is the nature of this output value What does the voltmeter 
 actually measure And what does it show  


Re RMS readings

Unless the DVM says it's measuring RMS it's probably Average voltage
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC  If it says it's RMS
and but measures squaretriangleetc  incorrectly it's measuring
average and multipling by a correction that's only true for sine waves
ie  Vave  Vrms  If you want correct RMS for most
any waveform you need a TrueRMS DVMDMM which literally does the
RootMeanSquare calculation in either analog or digital circuitry

 
    Related question less important to me
    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
 analog ones 

The last significant advantage of analog IMO  was  being able to
see the signal if it was changing over time eg  checking
electrolytic capacitors

Anymore most DMM have bargraphs etc that duplicate this

 
    Thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at
 avmzeustamuedu or open a discussion here I would appreciate either 
 way

I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and I've hit a snag
In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an
op amp amplifier from  to  controlable via a digital input
The most obvious way I've come up with is to use analog switches
to adjust the gain of the op amp The only analog switch I have
experience with it the  Unfortunately I want to switch an
AC signal which goes from about V to V and the  is only
for positive signals

 I have a carrier signal which varies between V and V I want
to demodulate an input signal by feeding the input signal thru a
amp with a gain of  when the carrier is at V and thru a amp
with a gain of  when the carrier is V The output is then
low pass filtered I believe this is called lock in detection as well
as synchronous demodulation

Look at the   This is a triple to transmissiongate analog
multiplexer with positive and negative power supplies can be run
from a singleended supply as well  With dual supplies the logic
inputs still range from ground  Volts to VDD

This is a neat well I think so design for a switchablepolarity
amplifier

CONTROL	X analog switch
                 
                 
                
                GND

All resistors are equalvalue  When the analog switch is closed
the amp is invertinggainofone  With the switch open it is
noninvertinggainofone  You can clean up the circuit to trim
out input offset current if this hurts the balance this would show
up as carrier feedthrough

For high frequencies the slewrate of the opamp might cause problems
especially if it isn't symmetrical and it usually isn't

	Uh oh
	Umm there are a number of copy protection schemes  Some involve
modifying the physical media and some involve encryption schemes c
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time  I recall however near monthly releases of new
ways to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest releases  The fact
is none of them are completely secure or anywhere near it  Some are more or
less difficult to crack and some have already been cracked
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult if not
impossible to answer  What exactly do you want to know  Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on  How secure must it be  Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used  I can probably make suggestions
assuming the activity is strictly legal  In general it is a BAD idea
legally to tamper with copy protection  It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of being as they are copy
protected which can be devestating  Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications and are merely curious
	Please clear up those questions and I'll try to help as much as I
can

	Incidentally the Uh oh at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack  The area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers many of which include breaking the law or at least addressing it
from one side or the other

I have written a program and I want to market it  I would like certain degree
of protection since my main custmers are individuals and not the 
cooperations   I know laser hole burning method and hardware key method
however my  software is going to cost only  so I can not afford that
Also at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my
software Well I guess say upto  illigal copying is ok by me

However I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software  
Off course I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying since they
can develope a better program anyway

I've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things
like photoresistors you know no light to photoresistor emit a logic
high etc

Anyway I've got some servos lying around and I wanted to do some things
with them using digital logic  I know all about having to pulse the signal
and everything I just have one problem  I'm assuming I need a negative
yes negative logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction 
opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high

Is a negative logic high I've seen this in schematics the same thing as
an active low or what  I'm not using a bipolar power source so how
would I get a negative logic high out of this thing  I need to have all
three signals available  Logic high logic low and negative logic high

Any help would be greatly appreciated  Also please reply via email as I
never seem to have time to read this or any other group lately

Thanks much

Here's the scoop  When you get your home brew receiver working would
you be willing to share it with the rest of us  I always wanted to
build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it

pin   signal ground
pin   signal
pin   always hot  volts
pin    volts hot only when preamp is turned on
pin   infrared repeater connectors

The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
to anything inside the preamp except the  pin connector pin   There
is a  ohm resistor between the two jacks with a K from pin  to
ground

The signal pin  in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver
They use a chip called CXA and a BJT to amplify the signal  I would
imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
it as the external receiver

If you need more info let me know

Are you sure that he needs a two way converter If he wants only

 onboard decoupling capacitors inside a cmos chip for the power
 lines Say I have a lot of space left im my pad limited design
 any data on the effect of oxide breakdown any info or pointers
 are appreciated

DEC did this on their new alpha chip  I'm sure you could call them up
and ask them how they did it haha

Actually there are some details in their article in IEEE Journal of
SolidState Circuits  I think it was sometime around Nov

I have written a program and I want to market it  I would like certain degree
of protection since my main custmers are individuals and not the 
cooperations   I know laser hole burning method and hardware key method
however my  software is going to cost only  so I can not afford that
Also at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my
software Well I guess say upto  illigal copying is ok by me

However I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software  
Off course I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying since they
can develope a better program anyway

I wouldn't bother with the copy protection if I were you  If you program
is any good the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be
distributing the stripped version is well under a week

Hardware methods prevent J Random Loser from using his Copy II PC to pirate 
your software but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough 
connections to real pirates who will be able to defeat your check for the 
hole code

You may want to price your software depending on what it is a tad
higher a price change from  to  probably would turn off very few
potentials buyers and that way you could tolerate more pirates whose
numbers don't change with the price

As for the  pirating figure ha ha  Of course a lot of pirates just
have this thing about having pirated software even if they never use it
so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards   Even so  is awfully
low

slightly more viable alternative

I booked a hotel Red Roof Inn last week in Cincinnati Blue Ash which
is at the northern tip of the metro Cincy area  I chose it for a few
reasons
    All hotels in and near Dayton were booked solid
    This hotel is only costing night
    It was one of about  rooms left on the night I reserved
    Cincinnati probably has more to to at night than Dayton  I intend
      to hit the riverboat entertainment at dusk

If anyone has other suggestions for nightlife please let me know of
other hot spots  Thanks

Hmmm  How are those orange isolated ground outlets often used in
computer rooms wired  

They require two separate grounds  One ground goes to the ground pin
of the outlet and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's
mounting tabs and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal
faceplate if any

The boxfaceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground
The outlet groundpin wire is generally connected to an insulated
busbar in the distribution panel which is in turn connected to
the buildingentrance main ground by its own wire

So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the
building's service entrance  But one is also connected to every
grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building
while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged
into isolatedground outlets of that panel  If someone happens
to accidentally short one phase of a V feeder to ground
the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it
until the breaker trips or the fuse blows while the isolated
ground will remain relatively noisefree

Hi Netters

I am looking for the list of universities in Austrailia which has electronics department 
I am considering to spend a year for research in Austrailia about communication area I am interested in Mobile communication areas and spread spectrum communications etc 
But I don't have any information about Austrailian Universities
Can anybody recommend a good university in communication area
Any comments will be welcomed

Can I suggest the University of Western Australia in Perth
The weathers great the people are great and our Electronic Engineering department is great
I am a first year student here  so I don't know much about what projects but I do know they have a good reputation in the fields of dsp and communications  Ever heard of QPSX  The people who own are exUWA  so that gives an indication of what the department is like

The Atari  used a  CPU just like their entire bit line
   xe xe computers as well as the 
game machine The  had some extra ASIC chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks Later model 
might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years

Additionally I think the  used K K and up to K of ROM for
their games I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with but I
would hazard a guess of  or K RAM Think comes from a lot of hacking
with the  and xe computers And occasionally hacking with the
 fixing it for monitor composite video use and audio hookups
Also I tryed to make a cartridgeless system that stored the ROM into
a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time a way to
backup cartridges I've heard of a setup like this where games could
be bought cheaply on FSKrecorded tapes then you would load them
into a special RAM cartidge and play them

Anyways if you're interested in looking for  equipment we've got
two  machines around one composite AV modified and lotsa
cartridges Willing to sell for reasonable offer  shipping and
handling Don't play it anymore since going to computers  Nintendo
interested in that too

Hope that helps your question I might grab some 's out too
since they must be fun to play with as microcontrollers

FYI  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is th inch  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge however limit you to generating dots at  per inch
On almost any paper the ink wicks more than th inch anyway

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput   ppm for a laser versus about 
ppm for an ink jet printer

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer  A  page yield toner cartridge is about
US  at discount while HP high capacity  page yield
cartridges are about US  at discount  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles

thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near
the Virginia State lines  At that time there were no radar
detector Detectors  I am not sure of the impact but I would
imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a
radar detector became difficult  if not impossible

As I said earlier efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law
against radar detectors has been in vain  In fact effective

accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now

Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have

I now have some information on how to modify this for use with a BBC B 
computer Not only do you have to change the speed from  to  rpm
tried that but also change  components in the RecPlay section to allow
for the lower data rate kbit not kbit as it was designed for and also
change the Recording Current to allow for the low data raterev speed

Hopefully this should sort it all out  not bad for  quid normally

May we interpret this as an offer to volunteer as editor for a
Copy protection FAQ  I am quite sure that I am not alone welcoming such
an initiative I will volunteer to ask some of the questions if you will
provide the answers 


Ok here could be the first question or answer or something

Q I want to copyprotect a program I wrote  How should I do it
A You would be wise not to copyprotect that program  You see those 
   people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to 
   various length to crack your program and some of those crackers 
   are good and know the common tricks
   So the copy protection wouldn't stop those
   Ok then  What about legitimate users  Copy protection can be a hassle
   for legitimate users and can hinder them in their work expecially
   if there is some key item that can get lost
   So the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users but
   would make life somewhat of a misery for them



This is my opinion and I speak as a legitimate user 
You are of course free to have your opinion about this subject

Why don't you just run one LED at  KHz and use a flip flop at the receiving

Hello

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office and I notice that
it proudly proclaims  TIMES OVERSAMPLING on the box  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is the rate of discrete samples
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor
I don't understand this  TIMES business  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player was it REALLY  years ago the specs
said  TIMES   Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting
senile  If I'm not then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate  If I really wanted better fidelity wouldn't
I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording
process  Furthermore am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate
from the player's point of view as being the same thing as the data
rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium  Does this mean
that the data rate related to the rotational speed of the disk has 
changed since 

I'm so confused

Another poster explained the origin of the information sensors embedded

HELP  This morning I turned on my computerto be greated with a popping
noise from the monitor  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and to
my disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke  Great
I opened it up to see what I could see it's  years old no warrenty for me
On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorly
fryedburnt to a crispcan't even tell what value it is  This is the
only pjhysical damage I can find  But to my knowledge resistors don't
just randomly blow  What could have happened  A voltage regulator
problem  The fuses nearby are intactgreat job  I have  thoughts as
to why it did this  One over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier for
about  weeks although it was halfway across the room  Could moisture
done this  I last used it over a month ago  Second as most people
doI never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor  I have
everything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang on
with it  Now is this bad  Should I quit doing it  Is my system
getting too much power or varrying power this way when activated

Nowbefore I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor to
see what happens  But I have no idea what value it is  Or even if that
would fix thingswould it just blow again  Right now when I plug it in
and turn it on I don't even get the power LEDa power supply prolem
Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop 
It is resistor R  It's near the metal shield that
shgieldssomethingnear a large black electrolytic capacitor  It's on
the right most pc board  The monitor is an Imtec N from mid
Does someone have schematics for this  Or would someone be willing to
take theirs apart and see what value R is  Basically what the hell
should I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time

I have crosposted this article  Please respond via email with any help or
suggestions  Also does anyone have Imtecs phone or address  My manual
lacks either from what I can see  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY
Needless to say with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanning
groups while bothering my friend to use his computermodem
Helpthis really bites and I need it working ASAP

	With relays alone you will always get a transient when
you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel  If you don't want to hear
the transient use some other device a photoresistoroutput optoisolator
is the usual sort of thing to gently MUTE the signal then switch
THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator

	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors
in switching audio because the photoresistor time delay a few
thousandths of a second kept any noise in the digital side which
drives the lamp from contaminating the audio  And the devices
are cheaper than relays

 It is too possible  As the original poster said it is very unlikely
 but definately possible  Can you say batteries


I've even seen pictures of an installation where the ham pulled a little 
trailer behind his car with a KW generator and ran the full legal limit 
while mobile I don't know what his gas mileage was like though or 
where he found resonators able to stand the gaff

I still have the building inspector's signature on the breaker box

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
ground and neutral in the outlet box big NO NO and you are talking
about them being connected in the breaker box as things should be

If this is not obvious the point is that there should be current
flow in the white ie neutralreturn wires when things in the

unless there is a fault condition  Notice also that in the breaker box
there is a wire leading from the abovementioned junction to earth ground

Note I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself from
various people on the net so I could be wrong

The data is only ever read once barring mistracks and such of course
and eventually gets turned into  KHz  bit two channel data
Oversampling takes two discrete data points and interpolates n points
between them for n times oversampling  When I asked people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation but significantly more
complicated

Anyway then the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective
sampling rate up to n times  KHz in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters  For the same quality filter higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters whereas for the same price filter higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters  So assuming the quality of
all other components in a CD player remained the same oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to antialias
filtering

 Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like preamp
A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive optical isolator It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp all packaged in a tube  When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers

I use an HF   FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals
There is no click since I put a uF cap across the LED  Distortion
measurement are very low with mic level and they went up to  at a
  dB line level  All I did was put the FET in series with one leg
of the balanced line  No hums pops just audio jumping out of silence
The FET runs about  million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 
ohms with it on

Hey it works and works well

I have the ARRL Handbook for the Radio AMateur and I'm getting the
Solid STate Design for the Radio Amateur

The handbook is  and Solid State is  from ARRL  Main Newington
CT  but you should be able to find them at electronics or amateur radio

Write a good manual to go with the software  The hassle of
photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing
the package for only   Also consider offering an inexpensive
but attractive perc for registered users  For instance a coffee
mug  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of
dollars so consider pricing the product at 

Or documentation for the program   A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach  send in your money and you get 
documentation and a free upgrade to the latest version  Perhaps even 
support of some small degree  Whatever you want to offer that is better 
than the circulating version

You're lucky if only  of the instances of your program in use
are nonlicensed users

Figure about  as I have seen

The best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into
your price structure  Sure it hurts legitimate users but too bad

It doesn't really hurt legit users  Shareware is still much cheaper than 
the alternatives

 since pm  It's now am I'm pissed off  Period  Alright I can
 drive the steppers through the P's no problem that's with the
 wire steppers  to  and the other  are the phase lines  Problem
   I've got some  wire steppers  I put the darkest line to  and the
 other  to the P worked kinda  Tried it with a printer stepper
 moves the head back and forth  wires didn't work too well  It 
would
 shift back and forth use something like a  instead  Also I've 
been
 trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it NO LUCK tried 
PNP's
 still NO LUCK  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what but I feel
 my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER  ARGGG
         I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hookup to

 type also tryed the npkg type no luck

                         I'm going to try getting some z's and I hope

I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance 
tube tester for a song Unfortunately I was a little out of
key the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement
Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movement
like it a deadbutnotthemeterdead unit or schematics 
to specify the current scale of the meter movement I can cut
and paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what the
full scale current was Or is EICO still contactable

The thing is a model  nope not a joke or any sort of snide

   I was just wondering one thing actually two  I hope that this is the
proper place to post this subject

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
when stored on a concrete floor  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that 'cause it ruins them
but he couldn't tell me why

thanks

For a project of my own I would like to build a InfraRed Remote control
receiver for regular VCRs and TVs remotes  Does anybody have any info
or tips on how to build such receiver 
In particular
a which photo detector should I use which wavelength do remotes use 
b which ICs or circuit should I use 
c any suggestions for circuit layout

Please reply to this group if you wish but as well via email my
link to usenet is not always available

	I'd like to see this info as well  As for wavelength I think
you're primarily going to find two   nM  a bit andor  nM
 a bit  Usually it is about  nM either way  The two most common
I have seen were  and  but I have also heard of  and 
I'm not sure that the  nM one way or another will make a great deal of
difference

	Another suggestion  find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote
and go look at the SAMS photofact for it  You can often find some very
detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
transmitter as well including carrier freq specs and tone decoding
specs if the system uses that

it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors  This

I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about  meters more is better in
daylight  The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward
 KHz square wave with  duty cycle

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc to give
information to a pantilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LEDs
possibly an Optek OP or Motorola MLED  Wazing would mean at least  Amp
current pulses  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to  and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the  required

Has anyone done something like this


	Yeesh you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs  May I suggest getting your
mitts on the Siemens SFH IRLED  This unit is designed to take some big
current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit  It will output
nearly a watt  mW with REAL short duty cycle times

nice thing about the SFH is that it is CHEAP  I got mine for about
 cents a piece even though I had to buy  of them

	BTW I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to  wattshonest
 WATTS  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company
name  The  watter ain't cheap around  but if you want some power
mamamia that's pretty hot  They also have a  watt a  watt and a
 watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individuals
If you are interested I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info

	Now as for the position detector you might try ELTEC in Florida
Phone number listed in the  ETID is   They seem like 
nice people  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices
so they might be able to help you out

	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying
The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although you'd
need to up your carrier signal concept to  KHz

One other thing there are bubblejets and then there are BubbleJets
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet whereas most produce really good
looking output such as HP's DeskJets  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets

PS  If you're in the market for a portable bubblejet printer I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet although I've heard the portable
Canons are good too I needed PCL support myself  With the DeskJet
Portable you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot

I second that suggestion  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet
I do own the HP Deskjet   It gives the nicest outputs with only
a minor loss of quality   For all intensive purposes papers letters
resumes I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer You do have to
look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters  Only one
grudge the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the
presence of moisture Even though the ink is waterproof  However
you would have to spend about  more for laser quality

The cannon bubblejets are nice however they don't seem to have as
much support eg drivers for popular programs as the HP inkjets
Also HP Deskjet regularplusc accepts xerox paper I believe
that the cutsheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet

If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink say
fountainpen ink then the HP deskjets are very cheap to maintain
I paid  for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 
months 

	Kimball who doesn't work for HP but just loves his printer
		  very much

PS I have a question for you netters I'm too afraid to refill with
the waterproof inks they sell in artsupply houses because I had brought
a bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge I
wonder what is a 'good' waterproof ink aside from buying refillkits
to refill my cartridge

I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job
of making schematic drawings  The program needs to be in
MSDOS Windows if possible

What I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by
dragging elements onto the screen and in this the elements
needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs case with pins
It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the
components as well as their values  In other words I want to
produce quality drawings  Printout would be to either  pin
dotmatrix andor Laser Printer

I would suggest Draw for Windows by Micrografx  I have this on my
home box  Its quite impressive and only cost UKL  It has a rather
nice clipart library facility which you can expand with your own
drawings  There is no circuit component clipart included but you
could add your own quite easily

It works with any Windows printer driver of course and can also
export embedded postscript and PCX files

Note I am not connected with Micrografx in any way

 My  yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries  I was
 wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how to
 construct a homebuilt battery  In my grade school days I remember seei
 the 'ice cube tray' version but I don't remember what to use as a good
 electrolyte or what the easily obtainable metals were

 Thank you in advance

I remember watching a whole Mr Wizzard program on this subject when
I was a kid  The battery constructed on the program which made the
biggest impression on me and generated the most power was made using
a galvanized bucket for the zinc and a copper toilet tank float  The
electrolyte was sauerkraut

Take a lemon  Stick a copper strip into the lemon  Stick a galvanized
nail in about  to  inches from the copper strip  You should get
about  volt from it  enough to light an LED

Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing
all over latenight TV recently I was wondering if they use forced air hea
or both If there's heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at
My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay  for a box a fan
and a heater Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks Heck the technology is only what  years old

You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book The
Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food by Gretchen McHugh  The heat source
is a  watt light bulb  Basically it's a vertical wooden box with
ventilation holes in the top and bottom lots of them you want the air
to flow  The light bulb goes in the bottom and wire cake racks are
spaced every  starting about  above the bulb

Or at a slightly higher cost in electricity you can do what I do  Use
your oven  NOTE  I do this in an electric oven some gas ovens may
not have a low enough setting  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or
racks in the oven  Set oven to  degrees the lowest setting on my
oven  if yours goes down to  that's probably even better  Stick a
wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch  this allows
for airflow  Leave the stuff in the oven for  to  hours check it
often since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator  If you are
using cookie sheets instead of racks turn the stuff over halfway
through

If you want more info email me since this isn't really the right sub
for this stuff

MJMHI I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
MJMsubjects I am currently learning about AMFM receivers and recieving
MJMcircuits I understand a lot of things but a few things I am confused
MJMabuot The first is the MIXER to mix the RF and local oscillator
MJMfrequencies to make the IF Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams as
MJMsimple as possible for this kind of mixer I have come across a
MJMMCSBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs
MJMACTIVEetc

MJMAlong the same note are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone
MJMmay have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see

MJMPS any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AMFM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
MJMELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot
MJMI have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
MJMcircuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help

Digikey has the NE chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on
one chip

For a great combination of theory with actual circuits the best
reference for nonengineers is probably the Radio Amateur's Handbook
from the ARRL  Most library's have it in the reference section


  SLMR   If ignorance is bliss why aren't there more happy folk

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and word has it that
something similar is on its way here  Since we apparently
don't have the sensor base you folks have they're installing
cameras at strategic points along the freeways initial tests
are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told with the
video being piped into a command center they're building
somewhere in the East Bay  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or
cheap labor will be used to interpret the data but large
multicolored status displays will show the various routes
using different colors to represent the various average speeds
for each stretch of highway  An announcer will sit in front
of the status 'wall' and will relay continuous verbal traffic
status to those who want to receive it  They're apparently also
looking into licensing a lowAM frequency to be dedicated to
providing continuous audio from this system

In the mean time they'll set up large incandescent display
boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data
on traffic conditions up ahead  My understanding is that the
system is subsidized as a pilot program and information from it
will be available free of charge  Perhaps the LA system is
similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate read
cheap

We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP
audio channel of television channels  and   These are verbal
reports qualified with a identification tone to tell invehicle
receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is
applicable to a given area  In LA they're probably using some
other TV channels but the concept is the same  Try setting your
stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel and go station
jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information
I believe this program is also subsidized making the invehicle
receivers cheap to purchase and without having to incur monthly
fees to use it  Since the makers of these invehicle receivers
don't have to pay for the broadcast this may not be completely
true they likely have no investment in keeping the system
up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves  You
may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car nothing
more when this happens  Perhaps a word to the wise  

I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more
info on how the LA system is networked and paid for

Cheers
Alan

Summary Need help

One notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys

For our class project we need to design and build a power supply
to the following specs

Voltatge  adjustable from V
Current   limited at A

Voltage must stay within  of designated value for I from A
AC ripple less than  mV rms

Of course we can't just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting
regulator chip 

Our problem is with the current limiting ie we've found stuff to
do the rest of the parts of the circuit  What the supply must do
if presented with a load which would draw more than A given the
supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
one amp  Thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we
should read one amp  If we measure the current through a  ohm 
resistor at V we should read one amp and the output voltage by
necessity must be V

The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output 
power transistor and therefore reduce the output

So does anybody have any ideas we could work from

Thanks in advance

Try the folks at Dimolex Corp La Crescenta CA 
Their number is    They make membrane keypads
that are very flat in layouts from  to  keys  They
have standard models tactile models with stainless domes
under each key to make a 'click' you can feel as well as
backlit models  Some of them can even be cut with scissors
to form a funky shape other than a rectangle  Many of the
models are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel

My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they
need a lot of power etc etc

I've seen them in surplus stores  All they are are fluorescent bulbs 
without the phosphor and a UV transparent bulb special glass  I've
also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary VAC
socket probably not what you want


I'm not too concerned with whether it's longwave or shortwave
but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs I'll take both

One other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about nearUV
light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light Does anyone
know what he was referring to

As far as I know near UV as opposed to farUV is longwave UV near
the visible spectrum  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental I hope
exposure to the eyes  As far as fluorescent minerals go the reason a
friend has a UV lamp some only respond to only one of short or long UV

Hope this helps

Thanks much

I've used onchip capacitors to reduce groundbounce noise on a small
systolic array chip that had pF loads on the clock lines
Design was in micron nwell cmos using the MOSIS scalable design rules
Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors

 They don't help much with simultaneous output switchingthere is
	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
	load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground
	return so you still get ground and power line bounce 

 They do help a lot with onchip loads as I had with the high load
	on the clock lines 

 The transients you are trying to suppress are really high
	frequency so forget about large areas of polythinoxidediff
	capacitors since the RC time constant is too large
	What I did is to make a metal metal poly diff sandwich
	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer allowing frequent
	diffmetal contacts  I forget exactly how wide the poly
	lines were  If I were doing this design again I'd probably
	omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead
	using just m m and poly and substrate but that has such a high
	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds

 You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings especially for
	output signalling than spending chip area on capacitors
	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
	a MOSIS tiny chip and the next size up was twice as big as I
	needed

I'm no expert at UPS's but you said something that made it sound like
you didn't realize something  On a typical UPS well on ours anyway
there is NO switchover from AC to DC  All the protected equipment is
ALWAYS running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge  If the power fails big deal  
the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but 
there's something like  carsized batteries in that cabinet so it 
takes a while

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter
why not do it all the time  Then there'd be no switchover to screw
things up and no having to sense the failure fast  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on and it'll be there in zero time when
you need it


Actually it's a bit more complicated than thatI sounds to me
your UPS takes in AC rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries and
then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again feeding your
equipment  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to
switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since
as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line

Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you
lose power and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to
replace the lost power  The problem here is the switchover time and
you've got to resync the AC in no time flat
That's a standby unit not a UPS otherwise there would be no interuption
Many standby units are labled as UPS's though  
 			Morgan Bullard mbcoewlcenuiucedu
				   or  mjbbuxacsouiucedu


Unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that
AC is available so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to
be usableya sorta have to make it work with what there already

Similar story with our telephone system  It was first invented back
in the 's  We're still using the same damn system media as they
did back then  If I have a phone from back then I can assure you
it'll work on today's phone system  It costs too much to overhaul
everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there

The module had  leads  power ground and demodulated output  It
contained the photodetector amplifier integrator and demodulator

If you want to buy one try Radio Shack or else a TV repair shop can

Hi people

OK heres my problem 
I keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which
detect IR light

I believe that you have to 'charge them up' under normal visible light
and then if they are exposed to IR light they glow or something like
that

I think that they are avaliable in the states and even in England but
alas I live in Australia  Could someone please inform me if I can get
these things over here and if so where and how much

Also are they really commonly avaliable in the states and if so then
how much are they and who sells them maybe if I cant get one here I'll
write to one of the companies over seas

Anyway Thanks in advance

Sab

I missed the first part of this thread are you switching line level or

If line level there's a single chip x stereo audio switch available
that switches  twochannel inputs into  twochannel output and also
has a mute function all controllable with ttl inputs  LM I think

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office and I notice that
it proudly proclaims  TIMES OVERSAMPLING on the box  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is the rate of discrete samples
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor
I don't understand this  TIMES business  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player was it REALLY  years ago the specs
said  TIMES   Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting
senile  If I'm not then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate  

The data is only ever read once barring mistracks and such of course
and eventually gets turned into  KHz  bit two channel data
Oversampling takes two discrete data points and interpolates n points
between them for n times oversampling  When I asked people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation but significantly more
complicated

You are quite correct in your understanding  The filtering is not
interpolation as that would distort the frequency content of the signal
you are listening to  Generally these players run the samples thru an
allpass filter network  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's
heart and the effect is rather spooky  It actually reconstructs peaks
that weren't there correctly too and fills in the gaps with the
properly computed values just as if there had been a real sample taken at
that point  I use a CPU to do all the math  It takes a decent but not
unreasonable amount of CPU time to do this  You can keep up with things
in realtime if you write efficient code

In case you care the filtering method uses an FIR finite impulse response
filter  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method  Anybody out
there know the real answer  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistoropamp weighting to accomplish the filtering  This strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs


Anyway then the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective
sampling rate up to n times  KHz in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters  For the same quality filter higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters whereas for the same price filter higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters  So assuming the quality of
all other components in a CD player remained the same oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to antialias
filtering

Actually I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not  You can use sloppier components and
give the filter a rolloff that isn't so sharp   It's too bad that they
charge more for something that I think is actually less costly to build

I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better  They are
built to a price spec and that spec says cheap as possible

Well letsee whipping out HPSX soon to be GX  inches ms
nanoseconds resolution  Hmm  That'll be rather difficult

The more standard read better method is to use ultrasound generally
somewhere around kHz  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light
radio waves and is therefore much easier to deal with

What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter

It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous

 One notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys

 For our class project we need to design and build a power supply
 to the following specs

 Voltatge  adjustable from V
 Current   limited at A

 Voltage must stay within  of designated value for I from A
 AC ripple less than  mV rms

To decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of
the limitercurrent and the allowed tempdrift

In the first case you can use a Ube of a transistor as a voltagereference
of about  VDC with a tempdrift of mVK In the second case its better
you use a bandgapref and a opampcircuit to detect the maximumcurrent
The output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current

What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments

    Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment
octave  octave etc  Thus the kHzkHz octave has the same
amount of noise power as the HzHz octave
    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment
Hz kHz etc  Thus the kHzkHz band has the same amount of
noise power as the HzHz band both bands are Hz wide
    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a dboctave
filter usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs
Note you can't get dboctave by using half a dboctave network 

    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements
It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers with octaverelated bands
as a flat line across the bands

Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such
a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard  values per decade

Yes It's called RADAR

 Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
 and determine distance This would be for short distances  ft
 and I would need to have accuracy of  inches or so

Depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in
a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this
concept

 How about measuring vertical distance as well any chance  or am I getting
 ridiculous

What is the difference between vertical and horizontal

 What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter

tony

Pink noise is a random signal with more lowfrequency components
than white noise

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency
analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density is flat which
means that every frequency is present in the noise signal

Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of lowpass
filtering a white noise signal Therefore pink noise contains much more
lowfrequency components

The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring
animals An additional lowpass filter with variable cutoff frequency will
explain you why

Enjoy it

In article hcbCunLDDnetcomcom hcbnetcomcom H C Bowman writes

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office and I notice that
it proudly proclaims  TIMES OVERSAMPLING on the box  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is the rate of discrete samples
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor
I don't understand this  TIMES business  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player was it REALLY  years ago the specs
said  TIMES   Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting
senile  If I'm not then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate  

The data is only ever read once barring mistracks and such of course
and eventually gets turned into  KHz  bit two channel data
Oversampling takes two discrete data points and interpolates n points
between them for n times oversampling  When I asked people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation but significantly more
complicated

You are quite correct in your understanding  The filtering is not
interpolation as that would distort the frequency content of the signal

They do interpolate  it's not linear interpolation though You are correct
that the frequency content is not altered more specifically the baseband
spectrum is preserved and so is every Nth image spectrum The other
N in N image spectra are removed where N is the oversampling rate

you are listening to  Generally these players run the samples thru an
allpass filter network  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's

Ideally the filter has a gain of  from Hz to Hz and a gain of 
from  to the new Nyquist frequency In practice a finite transition
band is required and there is also a certain amount of passband ripple
and stopband leakage With a high order eg  taps digital filter
a very good approximation can be easily achieved

  BIT DELETED ABOUT OBSERVATIONS OF INTERPOLATION FILTER AT WORK 

In case you care the filtering method uses an FIR finite impulse response
filter  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method  Anybody out
there know the real answer  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistoropamp weighting to accomplish the filtering  This strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs

No they actually use a digital FIR just like yours but built in hardware
on custom VLSI chips for mainly economic reasons

Anyway then the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective
sampling rate up to n times  KHz in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters  For the same quality filter higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters whereas for the same price filter higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters  So assuming the quality of
all other components in a CD player remained the same oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to antialias
filtering

Actually I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not  You can use sloppier components and
give the filter a rolloff that isn't so sharp   It's too bad that they
charge more for something that I think is actually less costly to build

I guess that the answer is somewhere between the two

As an interesting  aside some of you out there may be aware of a scheme
used by Pioneer and Wadia which is called by Pioneer at least Legato
Link I haven't heard one of these players but by reading advertising
blurb and a couple of pseudotechnical articles I deduced that all they
do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter and let a load of the
first image ie aliassed spectrum through Talking to Bob Stuart of
Boothroyd Stuart aka Meridian confirmed my suspicion He said that it
sounded awful but then he would wouldn't he

This would be susceptible to fading multipath etc We used to use a
system at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa It used a
 GHz signal between  units across the distance to be measured
The  GHz was just the carrier the real signals were several switched
ones around  MHz or so whose relative phases at the receiver would
read out the digits of the distance down to  cm if needed The units
came with psychrometers sp to measure the relative humidity and
instructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp
They were rather heavy and required an operator at each end
Current technology uses polarized reflectors dual polaization TXRX
and psuedorandom coding of a radar pulse about the same resolution
at X band much better at GHz Only one end is heavy

	How does the radio Electronics free information cards work
Do they just send you some general information about the companies that
advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a
catalog 

That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled
Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards then each advertiser
gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers
who circled their number Some magazines also provide the data on
selfadhesive labels and the really big magazines provide the
data on computer disk

The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get You will
notice that the Radio Electronics information card commonly called
a bingo card in the industry includes lines for a company name
and a business phone number My guess would be that the big national
advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as
best they can For example if you include Motorola as your company
and include a business phone and a mail stop Tektronics will probably
send you a copy of their hardbound catalog and have a sales engineer
call you about a week later If you leave it blank odds are they
will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail
outlet Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th
e whole catalog And then some companies like Digikey or Jameco have
nothing to mail out accept the catalog

A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards Free industry
magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer They
use the information at least three ways They note that you really do read
the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push
you through repeated mailings to resubscribe They also compile
how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics
This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that  of readers
requesting data were interested in capacitors And finally some
magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information For
example Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information
about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's in the past  months

The other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazines
include how many items you circled on the card If they want the
advertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors from
the serious potential customers

Can you say qualified sales leads I thought you could

What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards

  Never circle more than  number on the card If you want more
  than  items use the second card and mail it a couple of
  weeks later

  If you are really really serious and you really really want
  the information CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK This will also
  cut about  days off the the response time Virtually
  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data
  on a computer printout

  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're
  not really qualified for send in a bingo card at least every
  other month and circle two or three numbers

  Include a business name and phone number even if it's your house
  Advertisers almost never call

They've been out of busines for years

Several other electronics or surplus type places are still on Canal
Street

Not any more  About  years ago they all closed
When RamcoElectronics city closed it took weeks and many
dumpsters to clear everything out so I heard
There are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires
but no chips capacitors or discrete stuff

SylvanWellington is still on Broadway and Canal but they're
not cheap and not surplus  It's mostly a TV repairman's store

	Yeesh you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs  May I suggest getting your
mitts on the Siemens SFH IRLED  This unit is designed to take some big
current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit  It will output
nearly a watt  mW with REAL short duty cycle times

nice thing about the SFH is that it is CHEAP  I got mine for about
 cents a piece even though I had to buy  of them

Are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost
recovery on  I may be interested  I think for practical and cost reasons I
am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the
output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to
extend range

	BTW I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to  wattshonest
 WATTS  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company
name  The  watter ain't cheap around  but if you want some power
mamamia that's pretty hot  They also have a  watt a  watt and a
 watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individuals
If you are interested I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info

Yes I'm interested in the company name  I have access to an extensive data
book collection  With that kind of power are we getting into an area where
eye safety is getting to be a problem

	Now as for the position detector you might try ELTEC in Florida
Phone number listed in the  ETID is   They seem like
nice people  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices
so they might be able to help you out

They are a long way from me but they might be a better source than I can find
around here

	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying
The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although you'd
need to up your carrier signal concept to  KHz

I'm keeping my application confidential for now  Raising the frequency should
be no problem in fact one respondent to my question said that I may not have
to mimic the  duty cycle normally used by IR detector chips

 The make some amazing IRLED's  The really highpowered devices are arrays of
   or  LED's on a TO header  The chip model puts out  Watts in
 response to a  Amp  uS pulse at a  duty cycle  I think  these are
 designed as illuminators for IR vision systems

Jeez that should do it

 I would also be interested in the application here  I work with a Dance and
 Technology program and want to build something to track dancers on a  foot
 wide stage from  feet away

Very interesting application controlled lighting and environment moderate
distances  might be more interesting than my application  Just a thought
you could use a roof mounted IR sender similar in operation to a TV remote
control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse  A Hamamatsu
detector as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread would give
the current position  Store and collate this on a computer and you could
replay the movements on the screen  Interesting

 May we interpret this as an offer to volunteer as editor for a
 Copy protection FAQ  I am quite sure that I am not alone welcoming such
 an initiative I will volunteer to ask some of the questions if you will
 provide the answers 
 
Hey now will you stop encouraging him Copy protection only serves one pur
pose to keep the honest buyer from making legal backup copies It will
definitely not stop any pirates If you want to protect you soft supply a
good documentation and support This is IMHO the only way of effectively 
protecting software

There are several types of copy protection and the point is to make sure the
user is using a legitimate copy  The simplest and virtually foolproof way is
for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on
some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a different
machine NOT installed from original disks will not work  

The program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine depends
on the programmer  don't use a disk drive characteristic  If the user 
did an upgrade to the machine heshe should reinstall all programs any way
No document lookup no disk wearandtear

I did not say that the originals would allow only one install  The user's 
conscience should do that

I know I'll get flamed for this  But with the increasing number of casual
users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights
It's the truth  I have friends who ask me for copies of my latest games
all the time and when I refused they went after somebody else casual
pirating is becoming more of a problem  Some sort of copy protection will
discourage the casual copying  I've seen what some of my friends dug up
somewhere  Latest and the greatest games all cracked WITHIN days of actual
release  You know how many bytes you need to change in Xwing to disable
the quiz  TWO  Yes TWO  And don't ask me which ones they are  Determined
pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not spread 
that far since pirate boards are not that wellknown and easily tracked once
found by authorities  It is the casual pirates that the copy protection is
determined to discourage

What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
REGISTERED TO XXXXX  address city state zip and disables the above
Two benefits  encourages registration  cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable because if the patch's registration message is
encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus
violated their license agreement

This way the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal 
discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as only
problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer

The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore
gains full rights and can restore to different machines  On the other hand
the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is 
supposed to be  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not 
supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement  Of course
a hacker can break that eventually but that's not the point is it

	Uh oh
	Umm there are a number of copy protection schemes  Some involve
modifying the physical media and some involve encryption schemes c
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time  I recall however near monthly releases of new
ways to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest releases  The fact
is none of them are completely secure or anywhere near it  Some are more or
less difficult to crack and some have already been cracked
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult if not
impossible to answer  What exactly do you want to know  Do you need a good

Matt

I have written a program and I want to market it  I would like certain degree
of protection since my main custmers are individuals and not the 
cooperations   I know laser hole burning method and hardware key method
however my  software is going to cost only  so I can not afford that
Also at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my
software Well I guess say upto  illigal copying is ok by me

However I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software  
Off course I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying since they
can develope a better program anyway

                      With highest regards
                           Babak   Sehari


 

One of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask
you for a word from page x line y and word z but this is pitifully simple to
remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program and
some selfrewriting code to confuse some people  Also make sure that your
program can not be run out a debugger

Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk
just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector   To help you here
you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph
Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with
garbage as well or they wanna be crackers can just look for the junk in
some random sector

Like you mentioned there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys but they
are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the enduser which you is the
opposite of what you want

Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the
machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can
think of  If the program does not find that this is the same system it
requests being installed by the original disk again  The original disk should
be encrypted compacted have many sectors that should be checked and anything
else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied  Once
again you MUST put codeencryption selfrewriting code and multiple CRC
checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed  Among other
things this also protects your program from virii  If the program detects a
change in its code tell the user that a virus has been detected in the
program  Tell them the program is VIRUS SECURE and remember you have
helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses  Feel good

I hope that I have helped  Have fun  Knock some cracking out well you can't
do it everything that can be written can be cracked but you'll piss'em off in
the process Goodbye

What is the program that will be sold

 Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
 and determine distance This would be for short distances  ft
 and I would need to have accuracy of  inches or so
 
You might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems They
work best for close work  mile and under

RF is used for much longer distances in two major modes Transponder and
phase measurment Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station
and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the
receiver time

Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the
same frequency signal multiplexed in time A receiver can pick them up and
measure the phase shift between signals Maps can be drawn that plot the
Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two
stations

I think that they are avaliable in the states and even in England but
alas I live in Australia  Could someone please inform me if I can get
these things over here and if so where and how much

Also are they really commonly avaliable in the states and if so then
how much are they and who sells them maybe if I cant get one here I'll
write to one of the companies over seas

Anyway Thanks in advance

Sab



	I got mine for about  bucks at Radio Shack  The instructions
DO say to expose it to light for a while but mine doesn't seem to require 
very much to make it work

	I just wish I could get a big sheet of the stuff abouit  x 
for a reasonable priceit isn't cheap from what I've seen

Oh yeah  This is a fine place  We haven't had the why does concrete
kill leadacid batteries thread in at least six months

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
when stored on a concrete floor  

The concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains
them into the ground

Another explanation implausible as it is  is that the leadacid battery
needs to be periodically charged toppedoff otherwise the battery
selfdischarges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction

Naawwwww the concrete sucks the life out

You should be clear in your mind what your goal is Two possible goals
are  maximizing you income from your program and  minimizing
the number of illegal copies which get created Accomplishing 
doesn't usually accomplish 

Most vendors have concluded that copy protection reduces the number of
normal legitimate sales by far more than it increase sales by virtue
of changing 'copiers' to 'purchasers' and hence merely reduces
revenue  Most legitimate buyers nowadays including me have had bad
experiences with copy protected products eg hard to make a
legitimate backup incompatabilties when new system on system upgrade
etc and they won't touch them with a ten foot pole

 I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the
 distance between a transmitters and receiver

Yes It's called RADAR
Well actually not quite Both Radar and RadioAltimeters measure distances
by measuring the time required to transmit a signal then receive its
reflection from a target Radar generally uses pulses while Radio Altimeters
use either pulses or a modulated continuouswave transmission In the case of
the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be made As an example
the original Bendix ALA Radio Altimeter was accurate to  foot at 
feet altitude

Note however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster
originally asked about The problem with gaining accurate measurements between
a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate
time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter
triggers This cannot be wire connected since radio waves will actually
travel faster in freespace air in this case than wire the difference
is called the velocity factor of the cable So you need to resort to a
common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance etc Something
like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick triggering both
the transmitter and receiver simultaneously Sound expensive Not too bad
but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort

Why not go to a different method Surveyors use a laserlight system where again
the reflection time is measured Why not try this Sounds like something a PE
should know about anyway 

 Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
 and determine distance This would be for short distances  ft
 and I would need to have accuracy of  inches or so

This is actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter
varies from unit to unit there are variances in the antenna and transmission
line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit
over time You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system With
the radio altimeter this is also done but since everything is located at
one place it is much easier to do Note especially that the time base for
the RA receiver and transmitter is one unit also

Depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in
a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this
concept

Nope FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins That is unless
the two interfering signals are seperated by more than  db in signal strength
This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes
Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong

 What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter

As high as possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance
attenuation of multipath signals Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies
around  GHz

Hope this helps

 There are several types of copy protection and the point is to make  
sure the
 user is using a legitimate copy  The simplest and virtually foolproof  
way is
 for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed  
on
 some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a  
different
 machine NOT installed from original disks will not work  
 

Okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part  
on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself  
upon goes bad you replace that part and now your program won't run  
because it's on a different computer

This is of course assuming that the program uses something in ROM like  
the BIOS serial number maybe and not a diskbased code number   
Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway

I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system   
We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred  
machines both PC and Macintosh as well as administering a network of  
over  NeXT machines  I personally am concerned only with a small lab  
with ten PC's and ten Mac's  I'm not the manager but help him with  
admin often  IMHO copyprotection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  
than a major headache for the legitimate user  Anyone who wants a copy of  
your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy  Period   
Pirate board or no pirate board  I too have friends who blatantly and  
quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their  
sleep

Let's consider what goes on in our lab  Almost daily we have at least one  
machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screwing up some  
setting or other on a piece of software  Admittedly we being students  
mostly are not the world's most efficient and effective network  
administrators but we try  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  
partly my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to  
the average user and maintaining behindthescenes consistency is a  
real headache but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  
different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  
disk

Often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do  
some partsswapping to get stuff working temporarily   

Well I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all   

The point is often we have to reinstall software and copy configuration  
files etc from machine to machine  By far the easiest way we have found  
to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to then  
COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that  
machine's type  This ensures us that for at least ten minutes we have  
ten IDENTICAL machines to work with  Having them networked simplifies  
this considerably as our major packages WordPerfect Windows etc are  
all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with

Often however we need to install a package requested by some instructor  
to one some or all of the machines for a special project  This is  
usually a handwritten or sharewareetc program similar to what I believe  
the original poster was asking about  The few we have had with copy  
protection schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  
  

In short don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme  It's sort  
of like outlawing guns  The criminals will get your program anyway and  
you will only be hurting the legitimate honest user  Write a good user's  
guide and tech manual whatever else for your program PLEASE do this  
REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute  
the manual to LICENSED users  Jack the price to cut your losses but  
please take a cue from the major companies who can admittedly afford the  
costs of illegal copies far better than you and don't burden the  
legitimate user with a copy protection scheme

 The program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine  
depends
 on the programmer  don't use a disk drive characteristic  If the  
user 
 did an upgrade to the machine heshe should reinstall all programs any  
way
 No document lookup no disk wearandtear
 
 I did not say that the originals would allow only one install  The  
user's 
 conscience should do that
 
 I know I'll get flamed for this  But with the increasing number of  
casual
 users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights
 It's the truth  I have friends who ask me for copies of my latest  
games
 all the time and when I refused they went after somebody else  
casual
 pirating is becoming more of a problem  Some sort of copy protection  
will
 discourage the casual copying  I've seen what some of my friends dug  
up
 somewhere  Latest and the greatest games all cracked WITHIN days of  
actual
 release  You know how many bytes you need to change in Xwing to  
disable
 the quiz  TWO  Yes TWO  And don't ask me which ones they are   
Determined
 pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not  
spread 
 that far since pirate boards are not that wellknown and easily  
tracked once
 found by authorities  It is the casual pirates that the copy  
protection is
 determined to discourage
 
 What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
 a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
 REGISTERED TO XXXXX  address city state zip and disables the  
above
 Two benefits  encourages registration  cuts down on pirating and
 makes it more traceable because if the patch's registration message is
 encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a
 stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus
 violated their license agreement
 
 This way the legitimate users who does not register will experience  
minimal 
 discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as  
only
 problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer
 
 The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and  
therefore
 gains full rights and can restore to different machines  On the other  
hand
 the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is 
 supposed to be  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was  
not 
 supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement  Of  
course
 a hacker can break that eventually but that's not the point is it

Hello

Can somebody tell me what kind of MOV's are most useful for a computer
surge protector  Radio Shack have  types both rated V one for
a A current and the other for A  On the other hand commercial surge
protectors I have seen claim a clamping voltage of VV which SEEMS to
me in imply a rated voltage of about V V  SQRT

What is the right kind

While at it ow important is really the EMIRFI module  Is there really any
noticable level of such noise in the power line

Please  EMAIL to me as this group has too much volume for me to be able
to follow

Thanks

Hey now will you stop encouraging him Copy protection only serves one pur
pose to keep the honest buyer from making legal backup copies It will
definitely not stop any pirates If you want to protect you soft supply a
good documentation and support This is IMHO the only way of effectively pro
tecting software
Best Regards
Arno

I strongly disagree I think most pirating is done by amateurs who won't
copy the program if diskcopy can't do it
If you're talking a  max goal of pirated copies I bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy and can't be easily copied from a hard drive will
suffice
I hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not
because I want to copy the program but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find

Off deeper end Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
backup copy Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk
so you are left with the originals as your backups I think its a waste
of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
out the backups 


No flames intended  just my thoughts

   Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
 when stored on a concrete floor  

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals

The same thing happens to my car Citroen CV  damp gets under the
bonnet US hood and shorts the sparkplugs to earth so it won't start

The solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with
WD moisture repellant  If damp is the problem then storing the 
battery off the ground may help  I'm not sure if spraying with WD
would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum

Just a thought

   I was just wondering one thing actually two  I hope that this is the
proper place to post this subject

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
when stored on a concrete floor  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that 'cause it ruins them
but he couldn't tell me why

thanks
camterastroocistempleedu

I am not a battery expert but from recent reading a lead acid battery
will self discharge at a relatively high rate and if stored in a discharged
state will develop a condition I think is called sulfation  In storage
either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use fat chance
I'd ever do that at home or the battery should be stored on a trickle
charge  I have also I think read that the condition may be reversable
if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time
The refernce I remember is to use C where C is the amp hours as the
charging circuit and leave it hooked up for weeks  Some of this may
only apply to Gel type cells but I suspect the same applies to the liquid
type

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a character containing
all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt  This

True enough but

means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
time slot which basically indicates a BREAK  There is no special way to
detect BREAK that I have found other than this  there's no magic signal
generated by UARTs etc

Zilog SCC

	RR  Break Detect

This is a very popular part but it has a number of quirks especially
in HDLC mode

Signetics  DUSCC

	RSR  Break Start Detect
	RSR  Break End Detect

Two of the bits in the Receiver Status Register  You can enable an interrupt
on either of these bits going high too  Also only one NULL will be put
in the FIFO per break detected

This is simply the best serial chip I've ever worked with  Many less
quirks than the SCC which is IMHO secondbest  Death to  devices

The Atari  used a  CPU just like their entire bit line
   xe xe computers as well as the 
game machine 

Wrong it has a 

The  had some extra ASIC chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks 

It had one custome chip not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood
the TIA sometimes known as the  although most other manufacturers list
that as the CIA complex interface adapter  TIA stands for Television
Interface Adapter and it handles sound paddles and the minimal video hardware
the  possessed

There was also a standard  RAM IO Timer RIOT plus a voltage
regulator and if memory serves a  timer  That's all

Later model 
might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years

Not according to the servicing documentation I have here  The  did not
change intenally very much at all

Additionally I think the  used K K and up to K of ROM for
their games 

ROMS were mapped into the upper K of the 's address space  K and K
games were fine but later K and K games needed bank switching  Atari
and others made much of these huge cartridges

I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with but I
would hazard a guess of  or K RAM 

Wrong it had  bytes of RAM from the RIOT  This was multiply mapped into
both page  pseudoregisters and page  stack and also throughout the
bottom K of memory  TIA registers also sat in this address space

As  bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting some later cartridges also carried
RAM themselves which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line
to the cart  This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address
range and the writes into another but all the time this scheme ate into
the very scarce ROM address space

I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection

I would expect that CDROM software would not even need copy protection
As the program on a CDROM would not fit onto a harddrive and it is
impossible for the average and even notsoaverage user to write to a
CDROM copies of the software that still work could never be made

Hmmm now that I think about it with a creative TSR maybe
diskswapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk You
would need a tonne of disks though

   Hams can legally run up to  watts  It is very unlikely however
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  Ham rigs

Not possible either  You'd need about a  amp alternator for
just the amplifier  I can just see it  You need to slow
down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button

Now that indeed is possible  A good friend of mine is running about  KW
PeP from his car  Yes he does have a second alternator  Yes he calls
the rig an electronic brake since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio but I seem
to remember that PeP is actually x the real power  Which makes KW PeP
actually around W  Or was it x  I disremember

Effective transmitted power is also odd in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry  Which is why a TV station with a KW Klystron
might advertise a megawatt if their antenna is on the top of the
CN tower 

This is like Sears HP 

Though  real watts still isn't impossible  About A with
a V alternator less if the alternator produces higher voltages

It's only three horsepower taking into account inefficiencies  You'll
feel it when you hit the key  But not too much

 I hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not
 because I want to copy the program but because its usually faster and
 and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find

Just MHO but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  
of them open spread across the bed next to the desk in my dorm and  
reference them while using the program fullscreen  The Windows Help  
things come closest to good online documentation I've seen but they  
generally aren't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  
space even compressed which is at a premium on my system     In  
fact the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borland's C compiler  
instead of using the one the lab licensed in the lab of course  I've  
got a SHELF full of books to help me out when I'm stuck     To each  
his own    

 
 Off deeper end Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
 backup copy Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk
 so you are left with the originals as your backups I think its a waste
 of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
 out the backups 

We've destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac  and  
Word for Windows may have been a bad batch of disks  Don't have the  
faintest idea what happened to them they just went bad  Weren't stored  
near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated indeed they were only  
used once  Given this and the massive headaches finding a working set of  
disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down I'd say  
having working backups is a godsend  I sure wish we'd had them Sometimes  
I think Murphy's Law holds true more often than Newton's when we needed  
them  I think it's sortof like snake antivenin   of the time you  
have absolutely no use for it but when you need it BOY do you ever need  
it

I don't have backups of my originals at home but then my machine doesn't  
see anywhere NEAR the useabuse of these here at the lab and so I  
consider it less of a risk  Still I usually make working copies of  
them when I install them and then eventually reuse these working copies  
for something else  


 
 
 No flames intended  just my thoughts

Just mine too  

BTW before anyone notices my mentioning copying programs from machine  
to machine when we do installs here and wonders about the licensing the  
uppermanagement nonstudent staff of course are METICULOUS in checking  
with providers of the software and making SURE we are sticking to the  
license agreements

I have numerous  series scopes which are surplus to requirements
These devices range from fully functional to having a fault which
remained unrepaired since they weren't needed any longer

My query is is there anybody in Australia interested in buying them

I think the shipping costs would make it impractical to send them OS
Certainly the mainframes but if you're willing to pay shipping I'll
consider offers for individual plugins

For those who are in the know anywhere in the world what are these 
bits worth second hand in your area

I have
		 Mainframes
		A Vertical Amp
		AA Vertical Amp
		A Vertical Amp
		A Differential Amp uV  Div  MHz  CMRR
		B Timebase
		BA Timebase
		B Timebase

in addition I have the following which have been smoke damaged in a fire
and although washed are probably a little more prone to failure than
the others

		 Mainframes
		N Mainframes
		A Vertical Amp
		AA Vertical Amp
		B Timebase

Overall I suspect that the A's are worth as much as all the rest
put together All bar one of these are operational  that one failed
and has never been repaired because it was no longer needed

The A has an onboard voltage offset as well as switchable high
and low pass filters There is nothing on the market to my
knowledge that comes close to the specs of this plugin

All of the above have service manuals

I would expect that CDROM software would not even need copy protection
As the program on a CDROM would not fit onto a harddrive and it is
impossible for the average and even notsoaverage user to write to a

Hmmm now that I think about it with a creative TSR maybe
diskswapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk You
would need a tonne of disks though

There are many programs on CDROM that fit on a harddisk not all software

What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
REGISTERED TO XXXXX  address city state zip and disables the above
Two benefits  encourages registration  cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable because if the patch's registration message is
encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus
violated their license agreement

You take two copies with a different registration id compare them byte for

When constructing active filters  odd values of resistor are often required 
ie something like a  K Ohm resistorIt seems best to choose common 
capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded

Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such
a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard  values per decade
 etc   It is a common enough problem  yet I cant 
recall seing a program that tells that RxRyRz gives Rq  starting with 
q and finding prefered values xy and z

I once wrote such a program in BBC basic It was very crude and took
around  seconds to do an exhaustive search with a small amount of 
intelligence and told you the best combination Rq and the best below Rq

If you want to write one just store the prefered values in an array and
then search the solution space using three nested loops I'm sure you
could knock this up in an hour

    Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable

I think it's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is
not being charged or discharged I remember some advice from an ancient car
manual guide my father had which was to use car batteries to power a garage
clock or something similar when they're not in a car This is supposed to 
prevent the oxidation but I've no idea if it really works The concrete floor
connection is a red herring

 
 It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
 by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals

This may contribute to discharging but would be reversible
 
 
 The same thing happens to my car Citroen CV  damp gets under the
 bonnet US hood and shorts the sparkplugs to earth so it won't start
 
 The solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with
 WD moisture repellant  If damp is the problem then storing the 

Well this is offtopic but back in the days when I used to drive bangers
I never found WD to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did'nt do
I think the effectiveness of WD is a myth invented by the guy who owns
the company

 battery off the ground may help  I'm not sure if spraying with WD
 would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum
 
 Just a thought

Hi
I am looking an integrated circuits for my Zbased 
computer
The circuit is called ZSTI Serial Timer Interrupt 
MK and
made by Mostek Mostek is called SGS Thompson today
 
I have been in contact with SGS Thompson unfortunately 
they me told that ZSTI is obsolete
 
So my question is if anyone know if I can get hold of that 
circuits Are there any companies that specialize in selling 
circuits that are no longer in production I have contacted 
several electronic brokers in
Sweden but without any success I would appreciate if you 
could give me hint where I should continue looking Even 
companies in the United States would be fine since this 
circuit is pretty crucial to me
 
 
Thanks in advance

 I hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not
 because I want to copy the program but because its usually faster and

Just MHO but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  
of them open spread across the bed next to the desk in my dorm and  
reference them while using the program fullscreen  The Windows Help  
things come closest to good online documentation I've seen but they  
generally aren't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  
space even compressed which is at a premium on my system     In  
fact the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borland's C compiler  
instead of using the one the lab licensed in the lab of course  I've  
got a SHELF full of books to help me out when I'm stuck     To each  
his own    


Agree  personally I cannot flip from page to page on a screen and
retain information as easily as in the written page

 
 Off deeper end Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
 backup copy Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk
 so you are left with the originals as your backups I think its a waste
 of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
 out the backups 

We've destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac  and  
Word for Windows may have been a bad batch of disks  Don't have the  
faintest idea what happened to them they just went bad  Weren't stored  
near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated indeed they were only  
used once  Given this and the massive headaches finding a working set of  
disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down I'd say  
having working backups is a godsend  I sure wish we'd had them Sometimes  
I think Murphy's Law holds true more often than Newton's when we needed  
them  I think it's sortof like snake antivenin   of the time you  
have absolutely no use for it but when you need it BOY do you ever need  
it


Ditto's  in fact  at work where things are dead if the backup
is no good I insist on having at least a  level backup system  
It seems that whenever you have  good backups you never need them 
but if you don't have them Murphy guarantees that you'll suffer for it

I don't have backups of my originals at home but then my machine doesn't  
see anywhere NEAR the useabuse of these here at the lab and so I  
consider it less of a risk  Still I usually make working copies of  
them when I install them and then eventually reuse these working copies  
for something else  


 
 
 No flames intended  just my thoughts

Just mine too

	Greetings I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators
	and learn the black magic art of switching power supplies
	before anyone flames me I KNOW both have their place 

	Anyways I've built the basic up  down converters with pretty
	good results  efficiency but I'm running into problems
	when I try to design  build anything that puts out serious
	amps I know it can be done I have some VA guts on my
	bench but something puzzles me I'm using a simple choke as 
	the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding
	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings
	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
	the usual errorfeedback but some of the others seem to loose
	me What are they for Better than that anyone have a full
	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of I'd
	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
	low volume 

	My other problems in getting high amps  good efficiency are
	 Lack of sources of ideal components calculated and 
	Limited knowledge of the whole topic I'm doing this on my
	own not school mind you in fact I have yet to take any
	course that covers transistors 

	So is the answer to  the accumulation of dead commercial
	models and truning into a scavanger not that it's not what
	I'm doing now and  getting  understanding schematics
	and a bit more of the mindboggling theory 

	Take care

	PS My goal is V  A in car battery  VAC out and
	on the other end V  VDC  A V  A VDC A
	and VDC A the distance between the two will be
	more than  feet of  gauge but less than  feet
	Would like to have a working model in a year or so  
	Do I have a chance to make it

 The concrete is not the problem 

 Leadacid batteries often fail from disuse not being charged for a long
 time but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
 problem

ground was REAL cold  F the battery might freeze an split But then
it would probably freeze anyway

    I was just wondering one thing actually two  I hope that this is  
the
 proper place to post this subject
 
   Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally  
unuseable
 when stored on a concrete floor  
   I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the  
motorcycle
 from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just
 went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but 
 they act like the two terminals are shorted  I asked a friend
 and he said that you should never do that 'cause it ruins them
 but he couldn't tell me why
 
 thanks
 camterastroocistempleedu


What happens is that I heard this discussed on Northern Exposure there  
is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the  
molecules in the concrete  This acts as an attractant to UFOs actually  
their crew members and they arrive at the scene of the batteryconcrete  
combination

Then they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES

Remedy  Set the battery on a nonconcrete floor

Much deleted about assembly in USA vs other 
I wish to focus on the subject of warmrunning amplifiers

    Sure the amp runs very fairly
    hot  but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good
 
  An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound
  The amp you have probably is running ClassA the whole day
 
  because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
  to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  Hmmmmm
 

There is a correclation between warmrunning amps and good sound
or in your words it DOES have a bearing on

Now I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination
stoveamplifiers that will degrade lifespan
but a coldrunning circuit is much more suceptible to temperature
variation with varrying current than is a warmrunning one  And since
junction resistance is a function of temperature this has a detrimental
effect on linearity  

a few facts
bias points vary with temperature
junction resist varrie with temp
Adcom products do NOT run classA

If you still don't beleive this assertion consider the warmup requirements
for most good test equipment or better yet just listen to an amplifier
warmup  On many designs its quite audible on mine about  minutes for
the output stage many hours for the drivers  Fortunately the drivers
are not switched

In any experiment or when drawing conclusions from listening
betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias
idle current level  Both have a positive correlation with low
distortion and good sound quality and high bias results in
warmer operation all other factors being equal

 I built a little project using the radio shack vdc relays to switch
 audio  I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched  I was doing
 most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and
 nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks
 
 My question is
 
 	Is there a good relayrelay circuit that I can use for switching
 audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio lines
 
 I will appreciate any advice or references to advice  Also exact part
 numberscompany names etc for the relays will help

The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component intentional
or not on the audio lines to be switched If neither the output or
input presents an unintentional DC level let's say they're capacitively
coupled then putting a  K resistor from each input to ground and
from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any
coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click

If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than
just coupling capacitor leakage then you need to remove the DC before
switching with coupling capacitors of your own

If you have more than one relay each relay switching one input
through to a common output you can use makebeforebreak switching
where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch
change This may mask the switch click

An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and
making your own ersatz optoisolator with a lightdependent resistor LDR
sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink Many broadcast consoles
use this older but timehonored technique Claro actually makes
a complete optisolator like this but I don't have a part number handy
Radio Shack has a LDR grabbag  you might want to try

For a simple solid state clickless switch that is cheap you might try 
looking at the CD analog switch that is commonly available or its
older predecessor the  Again the DC component must be removed
prior to switching Other alternatives include JFET switches both discrete
and IC and diode switching which works relatively well surprisingly
All the above with their pitfalls and application tips could easily
make a subject for a multipage article

Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on
due to charge being injected into the audio line through device
capacitance when the control signal changes state Techniques to
minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through
the switch differential switching and slowing the risetime of the
control pulse With the  cutting the click can be as simple as
putting K  K resistors in series with the control pins

Hope this helps at least get you started

	Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum  Are you
going to require that a user reinstall all their software if they add Mb

BIOS and if software had told me this isn't the machine you installed me
on I would never have used that software again  Really bad idea

 I did not say that the originals would allow only one install  The user's 
 conscience should do that

	This is silly  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk and then give
them that  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone

 You know how many bytes you need to change in Xwing to disable

	Do you know any assembly language at all  All anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a JMP instruction
to just completely skip it  Not that difficult really  And there is very
little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing  Using PKLITE or
some similar utility would help but only if the resulting compressed EXE
were tagged as uncompressable

 What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
 a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup

	This is by far the best idea you presented in your post  Making it
plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates But the
determined ones are just going to answer Joe Blow to the question of
what's your name so this won't stop them in the long run

time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme

Two benefits  encourages registration  cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable because if the patch's registration message is
encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus
violated their license agreement

You take two copies with a different registration id compare them byte for 
byte and you know where they are located Usually you will be able to 
find out what is what after that 

Probably but the point is THE COMPANY make the registration patch NOT
YOU  Sure you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes
but WHY  It's not hindering you in any way unless you are just hacking
Problem about people who cut TOO MUCH from quoting

And what keeps me form registering as John Doe from the company Public 
Domain Yellow Brick Road  Tinseltown or something

Nothing but if you read my WHOLE suggestion I'm saying that you register
via MAIL by mailing in your registration card THEN the company send you
the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card

 I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video Vs
 a blank screen by monitoring the RG and B outputs of a graphics
 card  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
  MHz which would mean detecting a  NS pulse  It should also be
 able to tell the difference between a blank screen about  mv
 and a dim screen say around  mv  Oh yes it also needs to be
 cheap  
 
 My first circuit was a dismal failure  I used  compariators each
 compariator had the  input going to one of the guns the  input
 went to a reference created by a voltage dividera potentiometer
 
 The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow I
 needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
 compariators so I could have a whole screen full of text but my
 
 The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
 the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen  In
 fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
 only  mv  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
 video signals to make this work  
 
 There are faster compariators but they are expensive and require 
 split supplies   I would need to replace my  quad compariator
 with three  compariators and create a whole new power supply
 circuit  
 
 At this point I think what I need is some sort of transistor
 circuit  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick
 
 Unfortunately I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
 transistor circuits so I am appealing to the net for help  Any
 ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly
 appreciated  
 
 Oh yes I only sample the output of this thing every second or so so
 I don't need a fast response time at all however I haven't found a
 way to take advantage of that fact
 
 Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give Of course
 you will have my undying gratitude

IN ORDER to get the  nS response time you need you are better off 
going to an ECL slicer which can run off a single  or  V supply 
you just need to bias or do some level shifting perhaps to get it in the 
range Check out the ECL K books for a simple cheap solution

 One notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys
 
 For our class project we need to design and build a power supply
 to the following specs
 
 Voltatge  adjustable from V
 Current   limited at A
 
 Voltage must stay within  of designated value for I from A
 AC ripple less than  mV rms
 
 Of course we can't just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting
 regulator chip 
 
 Our problem is with the current limiting ie we've found stuff to
 do the rest of the parts of the circuit  What the supply must do
 if presented with a load which would draw more than A given the
 supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
 one amp  Thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we
 should read one amp  If we measure the current through a  ohm 
 resistor at V we should read one amp and the output voltage by
 necessity must be V
 
 The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
 a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output 
 power transistor and therefore reduce the output
 
 So does anybody have any ideas we could work from
 
 Thanks in advance

 ps If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project I agree fully
     but I still have to do it its graded 
 

You can design for ramp shutoff brickwall current limit or even 
foldback cutoffsounds like you want BRICKWALL current limit

Your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base 
drive In order to get the brick wall you need enough voltage gain on 
the current sensor  Normally a darlington on the current sensing 
resistor will be adequate but for infinite gain use an op amp to sense 
the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to 
turn off the base bias on the seriespass transistor  Phase compensation 
may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more 
than  degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK

 When constructing active filters  odd values of resistor are often required 
 ie something like a  K Ohm resistorIt seems best to choose common 
 capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded
 
 Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such
 a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard  values per decade
  etc   It is a common enough problem  yet I cant 
 recall seing a program that tells that RxRyRz gives Rq  starting with 
 q and finding prefered values xy and z

WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than  you 
need a trimmer or to screen devices it can't be made from adding  
resitors of  value in parallel since the smaller device will have the 
error of  to cope with 
You have  choices
a live with the error of  tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low 
sensitivity designs
b buy resistors with better than  tolerance VishayDale
c use trimmers or SOT's SelectOnTest

 Not that the question is anything important but I am still curious
 Why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green I have seen
 a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc Is there a
 technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have
 not tought about it yet
 
 Juha
The color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it

Original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown
Phenolic spelling was a tan
Most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green
Filled fiberglass is blue
Teflon is white

As boards evolved more and more demands were made of them  First boards were
used mainly in audio circuitry  Couldn't be used in high voltage or RF because
it would arc and burn  Most boards today are fiberglass the type being chosen
by its use and cost  

Boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon and ceramic as the
fiberglass and other boards are conductive they actually work more as a 
capacitive dialectric but the word conductive simplifies explaination at the
high frequencies

Another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections
is a thin flexible mostly mylar material and is used to connect the front of
the vehicle etc to the back instead of wiring harnesses  Camcorders use this
to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance

Am working on a generator made by Hewlet Packard right now and the entire board
is gold plated boy it looks expensive

Hope I got most of my facts right as I am working from memory of material read

My education was pretransister

    Hello I'm looking for information on Alphanumeric pagers 
and how the data is sent from the paging transmitter and how 
I would go about building a device to decode the paging data 
like my pager does and feed it though an RS port
    I'm planning on seperating different paging messages and 
different pagers in software to keep amount of hardware I need 
down  Does anyone know what chips Motorola are good for 
decoding Numeric and Alphanumeric paging data and then stuffing
it down an RS port basically any baud rate is fine  
    I already have a radio reciever with headphone level 
output for the audio signal from the paging tower but I'd be 
interested in anything you know about pagers including the 
type of radio recievers they use
    Thanks in advance

What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
REGISTERED TO XXXXX  address city state zip and disables the above
Two benefits  encourages registration  cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable because if the patch's registration message is
encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus
violated their license agreement

You take two copies with a different registration id compare them byte for 
byte and you know where they are located Usually you will be able to 
find out what is what after that 

Probably but the point is THE COMPANY make the registration patch NOT
YOU  Sure you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes
but WHY  It's not hindering you in any way unless you are just hacking
Problem about people who cut TOO MUCH from quoting

And what keeps me form registering as John Doe from the company Public 
Domain Yellow Brick Road  Tinseltown or something

Nothing but if you read my WHOLE suggestion I'm saying that you register
via MAIL by mailing in your registration card THEN the company send you
the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card

Kasey Chang

I'm glad to see this idea come up because I've had something similar in mind
What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address 
data  When the user registers you don't even need to send executable code 
just compute hisher key and send himher instructions to enter in the 
appropriate place the following

NameJoe Doe
Address Main Street
CityAnytown CA
keyldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd

Every user needs a unique key  The executable can propagate as much as you 
like the author can respond to the registration by email post card 
whatever  Unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else's name 
showing up maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message  
Authorized users can make as many copies as they like upgrade their 
machines whatever  The main motivation here is guilt and irritation at 
seeing someone other than yourself as the registered owner

It's not the temperature it's the karma  You see dirt has good karma
since it's all organic and full of living things but cement is all squared
off and artificial looking and has lost its karma in the process  Being
a karma sink it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no
longer able to keep a charge  Because wood is also good and organic putting
a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems

The Buddhanature is in the acid but it is also in the lead plate  The
novice asked the master whether the spongy lead had more of the karma or
whether the solid lead had it  The master handed the novice a V B battery
terminals downward and thus the novice was enlightened

Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available
via anonymous ftp at 'csusedu'

Since you've chosen the C you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'
To do this simply
 Load the game images into the EEPROM at   etc Your EEPROM
burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into
one file yourself with suitable gaps
 Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game
console and the high bits going to switches to choose between games

To directly answer your question above the pin that 'kicks up the address'
is simply another address line

For a concrete example with the C and K games images you would
wire AA to the cartridge and AA to  switches  The  switches
would allow you to pick from the  games on the EEPROM

	Hello again
 I asked this a year ago but i am still looking
 I am getting sick of having to use a HC 

If you are just getting sick of the real estate used by the HCT you could
always use the approach I have seen one designer take  he stuck the chip in
the middle of the EPROM socket under the EPROM  Naturally you have to use
an IC socket with the right dimensions but layout is really easy

A little correction on my previous post about an hour ago
Please replace the term 'EEPROM' with the term 'EPROM' wherever it appears
Don't not why I added that extra 'E' every time

Assuming you are refering to standard POTS or ground start lines

If you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions the RING
conductor is the one with approximately  to  vDC with respect to
ground while the TIP conductor is at or very near ground potential be sure
to reference the telco ground when taking your measurements  

If you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions the RING
conductor will be the one with approximately  to  vDC while the TIP
conductor would look like it's floating you may see some potential from
line capacitance it will bleed off over time  Remember to use the telco
ground as your reference when making measurements

Hi
	I am looking for a very high speed 
DA converter at least bits and MHz for
a research application A paper in  the January
issue of IEEE SolidState Circuits mentions a 
GaAs GHz bit DAC  anyone know where I can find
such a thing Even a somewhat slower Si DAC would
do
	Needless to say I have looked in all the
conventional places Vitesse Motorola National
etc etc Any pointers would be appreciated

backupable if restored to the same machine depends on the
programmer  don't use a disk drive characteristic If the user  did
an upgrade to the machine heshe should reinstall all programs any way
 No document lookup no disk wearandtear  

 This is not a good idea I upgraded my motherboard last fall  I would
have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to
reinstall simply because I changed motherboards 

Opinion is understandable    I assume you have a tape drive  Not all
of us have about  floppies around for backup you know  

 Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum  Are you
going to require that a user reinstall all their software if they add
Mb of RAM to their computer  I did that a couple of weeks ago  It's in
the BIOS and if software had told me this isn't the machine you
installed me on I would never have used that software again  Really bad
idea 

RAM is something you add all the time so no  It's more like BIOS
manufacturer andor processor type etc  Data cannot be used
esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette

On the other hand to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as
Please Insert Original Disk XX as I need file YYYYYY for update   
It would be perfectly reasonable  Sort of

  I did not say that the originals would allow only one install  The
user's  conscience should do that 

  This is silly  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk and then
give them that  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone 

Of course it is easier  Are you saying then the originals SHOULD allow
only one install  What is your point

  You know how many bytes you need to change in Xwing to disable 
the quiz  TWO  Yes TWO  And don't ask me which ones they are

  Do you know any assembly language at all  All anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a JMP
instruction to just completely skip it  Not that difficult really  And
there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing 
Using PKLITE or some similar utility would help but only if the
resulting compressed EXE were tagged as uncompressable 

I know x and x assembly quite well thank you  I know exactly which
two bytes need to be changed I have the code to do them too  I just said
Don't ask me which ones  I didn't say I don't know what that means

Such hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding antipatching code which
does a selfcheck upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match
value stored encrypted of course in the program  It could be claimed
as a part of antivirus code and it would not be far from the truth 

  What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus 
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
 REGISTERED TO XXXXX  address city state zip and disables the
above 

  This is by far the best idea you presented in your post  Making it
plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates But the
determined ones are just going to answer Joe Blow to the question of
what's your name so this won't stop them in the long run 

Did ANYONE read what I wrote  That is NOT what I wrote or meant  

What I said was the program should have certain restriction such as the
restricttoonemachine UNTIL the program is registered with the
manufacturer  The manufacturer will then supply the
thenprovenlegitimateuser with a patch that will disable the restriction
and PROUDLY PROCLAIM the legal copy with the Registered to XXX screen

  Pirates are always going to win this fight  They simply have more
time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme 

Of course they will but that was NOT my point  The purpose of copy
protection is to discourage casual pirates Oh can I have a copy of
thatSure here and the less sophisticated pirates Let's look for
all those calls to INTH   Any one determined enough to break copy
protection can and will succeed  They can always backtrace the entire
loadsequence of the program  The point of copy protection is to make
such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses
or to minimize such intrusion of legitimate use  Pirates who see copy
protection as a challenge love breaking them and no amount of copy
protection will stop them but the rest of us WILL be stopped  How many
of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us  Not that many

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable

This topic was beaten to death a year or so ago

The concrete is not the problem 

Leadacid batteries often fail from disuse not being charged for a long
time but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
problem

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a
colder leadacid battery selfdischarges at a slightly faster rate That's
why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works
to help keep from killing the battery as fast  it insulates the battery
thermally It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will
selfdischarge even slower The best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly but also tricklecharge it every couple days too to shallow
cycle the charge in the battery Such mild exercising of a leadacid
battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for
storage If you do remove the electrolyte may sure you keep separate storage
containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells
when you refill the battery This isn't so critical for a brandnew battery
in a fully charged state but will maximize the restored output of an older
battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   
storage

proper place to post this subject

I don't see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the
battery

However you would have been better off leaving them outside Keeping
them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside
A warm battery will selfdischarge faster than a cold one

When you are storing a battery it's a good idea to charge it once a month
Letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it I suspect this is
what caused your problems

Hi folks

I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying
that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
original I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different
processes However I've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I don't 
want to take the chance even it's small

Anyone has experience in this kind of selfdestructing video tapes

Thanks in advance

a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool  I have the clues 
on type A B and AB already and stuff but these other ones are mentioned 
occasionally and I dont know what they do  I think type D is like a PWM scheme
or something  Thanx in advanced

  Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing
all over latenight TV recently I was wondering if they use forced air heat
or both If there's heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at
My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay  for a box a fan
and a heater Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks Heck the technology is only what  years old

There are a number of inaccuracies here
 In fact a colder battery will selfdischarge more slowly  This is why
   batteries should be stored in a COOL dry place
 An battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed
   on wood  The battery the wood and the concrete will all be at the
   same general temperature ignoring temperature fluctuations and thus
   none will effect the other

The best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly but also tricklecharge it every couple days too to shallow

There is no need to 'exercise' the battery  Just keep it charged  A trickle
charger will do the job

I'm working on an audio mixer project but I'm having trouble finding
parts  I want to use opamps for the gain control stages  The ones
I have found that are good for audio are LM and LM but I cannot
find either of these in the electronic parts places I've looked

Are there any good substitute opamps andor are there any parts
suppliers in the LA area that carry this kind of thing KOhm dual
audio taper slider pots would be nice too

Any info would be appreciated  Thanks in advance

 Off deeper end Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
 backup copy Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk
 so you are left with the originals as your backups I think its a waste
 of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
 out the backups 
 
My own practice with new software 

make a copy of the original floppies to a second set of floppies

install to hard drive from second set of floppies

put originals in a box in room number one

put copies in box in room number two

 Accidents DO happen to original floppies
 Accidents CAN happen to the installation floppy
 Sometimes software goes out on floppies that are JUST marginally good  Or
   gets too close to a magnet in shipping or storage

I've had experience with SOMETHING like the last  I purchased a compiler from
a reputable vendor  THe debugger in the package just would NOT install to the
hard drive NO WAY  Repeated floppytofloppy copies FINALLY got a clean read
of the disk  I DON'T recall if I used diskcopy copyb or xcopy

I made a second copy of the marginal floppy and installed from that  No problenms  except with my typing    since

I regard backup floppies as CHEAP insurance

Just my side of the question

I have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressed
individually by a microprocessor say x or so  Is there an LSI that
is designed to drive an LED array including RAM to hold the array state
or failing that some way of multiplexing the display so I don't have to
latch a bit for each LED using a discrete latch  I want to avoid having
a huge board covered with s if possible  Thanks in advance

    Hams can legally run up to  watts  It is very unlikely however

 Not possible either  You'd need about a  amp alternator for
 just the amplifier  I can just see it  You need to slow
 down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button
 
 Now that indeed is possible  A good friend of mine is running about  KW
 PeP from his car  Yes he does have a second alternator  Yes he calls
 the rig an electronic brake since the engine noticeably slows when the
 key is down
 
 It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio but I seem
 to remember that PeP is actually x the real power  Which makes KW PeP
 actually around W  Or was it x  I disremember
 
 Effective transmitted power is also odd in that it takes into account
 antenna height and geometry  Which is why a TV station with a KW Klystron
 might advertise a megawatt if their antenna is on the top of the
 CN tower 
 
 This is like Sears HP 
 
 Though  real watts still isn't impossible  About A with
 a V alternator less if the alternator produces higher voltages
 
 It's only three horsepower taking into account inefficiencies  You'll
 feel it when you hit the key  But not too much

I strongly disagree I think most pirating is done by amateurs who won't
copy the program if diskcopy can't do it

I hate to disagree but I will 
note I don't pirate software nor do I trade it I simply have met and
talked extensively with those who have that's it the FBI can tap someone
else's phone 
Most pirating is done by people who don't use the programs they pirate
A cracked program tends to get passed on resplendant in the various graphics
and animations that advertise whoever performed the modifications

I admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving'
copies of programs to one's fellow workers maybe taking it home for use
on one's own PC but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most
spread throughout the business as a whole how many times have you had
someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks

It's mostly a matter of convenience a person sees a program they want to
use and they feel justified in making a copy since someone's already paid
for it etc etc A note this is starting to change a bit not much
though

If you're talking a  max goal of pirated copies I bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy and can't be easily copied from a hard drive will
suffice

what about commercially available copy programs CopyII
how about programs like teledisk that can do things diskcopy can't
and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy
wouldn't know about this
  after working with people around computers one comes to realize that
the 'average' user doesn't know much Any computer enthusiast is at least
x better at preguessing commands and how to use them can you sit down
and use something without reading the manual and it is these people who
are doing the ' pirating' not Joe Windows User who can't remember a few
arguments to the dir command

I hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not
because I want to copy the program but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find

really I find it evens out the online stuff can be read through faster
but you're stuck reading it in linear flow start to finish unless you
jump ahead with a search or such A book though you can flip through
faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty
index too

But I partially agree I often wish I could grep something that was written
down

so you are left with the originals as your backups I think its a waste
of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend

what if they need to reinstall The idea of a backup still holds if
the original disk goes bad they're out of luck for about  weeks which
is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks
if they'll do it without a charge

Could make for some interesting choreography light and sound could be 
controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number
of dancers on stage Neat
 
You could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage
 
Can you tell us more about what you're doing Sounds like a very cool program

Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point  I have yet to chose a tracking 
method  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer
in one of eight zones across the stage  I did some experiments with 
pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite
zone transition  And dancers stand still alot so their IR signature goes
away  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional 
to the size of the warm body or body part and the velocity of said body
This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture

Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their 
bodies but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked

The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the
Amiga used with a LIVE video digitizer  This works with a video camera 
trained on the stage  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of
view and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event Events
can be MIDI objects or sequences Amiga sounds or graphic objects  It's been
fun to play with but the documentaion is arcane and the digitizer is noisy
Still it's very appealing the dancers don't have to wear any appliances
you can have ots of zones it speaks MIDI which can be used to control lights
and I don't have to build any electronics  It's all done with lighting and
video brightness and contrast adjustments  I have yet to do anything
particularly useful or artistic but I have hopes

 Your Professor if just plain wrong  Although blue LEDs are one heck of

narrow region of transmittence  Since the Fermi energy around either side
of the band gap falls off exponentially blah blah

You might want to check the copyright date on that 

Blue LEDs most certainly do exist I've got a bunch at work  Cree Research
makes them probably along with other companies  Cree is big in
materials science though they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today
etc  You can buy them from JameCo I think DigiKey definitely and
plenty of other distributors

Actually these days you can get a typical visible light LED  it's
called a rainbow LED and I've forgotten who makes it they advertise in
EDN and many of the other trade rags though  It combines a reg green
and blue LED all on one chip and has four leads  Nifty device although
it's probably fairly expensive

It isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather
which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer
than ground temperature battery  Call it a question of thermal
conductivity or of insulating ability or thermal mass  whatever you
like  Question  why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the 
surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it

 	Anyways I've built the basic up  down converters with pretty
 	good results  efficiency but I'm running into problems
 	when I try to design  build anything that puts out serious
 	amps I know it can be done I have some VA guts on my
 	bench but something puzzles me I'm using a simple choke as 
 	the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding
 	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings
 	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
 	the usual errorfeedback but some of the others seem to loose
 	me What are they for Better than that anyone have a full
 	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of I'd
 	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
 	low volume 

Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage
that's handled by the big caps on the primary side those which in a 
linearlyregulated power supply would be considered the filter caps
coming right after the bridge  The transformer is just that  a 
transformer  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down  Although
the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT
negligible as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to
get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a
snubber diode across it would tell you  Actually many transistors intended
for switcher use today have the diode built in

The basic switchedmode power supply operates something like this in
a somewhat simplified manner  The AC line is rectified to produce a
high voltage moreorless unregulated DC rail  The energy storage or
filter caps appear across this rail as does the switching transistor
The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer
resulting in steppedup or steppeddown pulses out the secondary which 
are then rectified and filtered  At least one of the transformer's outputs
is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor
which acts in a pulsewidth modulation PWM fashion to control by varying
the pulse width the amount of energy being dumped into the primary and
therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary  The remaining outputs
may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will moreorless
tracking the regulated output or they may have some additional linear
regulation added  You may also note that the feedback between the 
regulated output and the PWM control which is most typically an IC
is not done via a direct electrical connection this is due to various
safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be
electrically isolated  Often the feedback path involves an optoisolator
to meet this requirement

While the transformer isn't the primary energystorage device in these
designs this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can
be ignored besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a
bad time as noted above you also need to worry about getting all the
energy that went in to the transformer back out again one way or another
In some designs this happens more or less automatically  but in others
you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't
saturate which again would have disastrous results best left to the 
imagination 

I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a powersupply designer 
hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors
in the above

I'm doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU
I have the Motorola MCUMAD Rev  but I fear it is out of date as it
does not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi

What I need is the Theta JC Thermal Characteristic the Junction to Case
thermal resistance for the PLASTIC FE style package

If you have this info I would appreciate your sending it by email as postings
suffer a few days delay here

If you are keen on this stuff I am also interested in a more accurate value
for the typical power dissipation I'm assuming  Watts using the  W
maximum at  C decreased the way the Pd drops in the x as Ta increases
If your manual has a chart of power dissipation I'd like to know what it
reads at  C and  C

Thanks for reading

   I was just wondering one thing actually two  I hope that this is the
proper place to post this subject

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
when stored on a concrete floor  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that 'cause it ruins them
but he couldn't tell me why


It's NOT the concrete floor that does it The problem is that leadacid
cells self discharge over time Even high quality cells Gates for instance
will discharge  over a  month period of time Nonsealed cells
self discharge even faster If the battery was not completly charged
when left sitting it probably discharged past the the point where cell
sulfiding occurs which in many cases means a ruined battery

Here is a different viewpoint

 FYI  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
 deskjet is th inch  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
 cartridge however limit you to generating dots at  per inch
 On almost any paper the ink wicks more than th inch anyway
 
 The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
 results in much less spread than ink drop technology

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed 
with inkjet because smudges etc can happen

 It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
 electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
 inexpensive ink jet printers  Recall also that laser printers
 offer a much higher throughput   ppm for a laser versus about 
 ppm for an ink jet printer

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of 
that how long does the first sheet take to print Inkjets are faster than 
you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the 
printer I have a  and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the 
printer

A sage said to me Do you want one copy or lots of copies One 
Inkjet
 
 Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
 life of the printer  A  page yield toner cartridge is about
 US  at discount while HP high capacity  page yield
 cartridges are about US  at discount  It could be that over the
 life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
 less than ink jet printers  It is getting progressively closer
 between the two technologies  Laser printers are usually desinged
 for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
 replacement cycles

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills Long term the laserprinter 
will need some expensive replacement parts consumables and on top of that 
are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer

HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the 
software package has no inkjet driver 

There is one wild difference between the two printers a laserprinter is a 
page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer This means that a 
laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot Few drivers 
actually use this facility
there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on

   Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
 when stored on a concrete floor  

When will people learn

The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast 
resistors are used to discharge batteries Furthermore it is very silly to 
store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to 
contact the ballast 

Seriously self discharge the actual problem as stated by others does vary 
greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge I have in 
fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full 
charge for   years so it must be possible

If your garage is heated store the batteries somewhere cooler but above 
freezing flat batteries freeze more easily Occasionally charge it once a 
month or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently special charger 
DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing seriously dangerous

Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like 
electric mowers  they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep 
discharged and their life may be greatly shorted Some early zero maintenance 
automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure 
shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb yrs  miles and 
counting

     I'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response 
to the output from a walkman cassette player How could I do this
I don't want it just to turn on I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak
per every beep I put on a cassette tape 

     Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps
on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain
frequency Is there any easy way to do either of these I'm looking for 
the simplest circuit possible I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of
color organ but not quite Let me trt to explain again


     I'm going to have a pattern of beats or beeps on a cassette tape
So on the tape you'd hear   beep pause beep pause beep pauseetc 
 with speed increasing as time goes on I want to synchronize an LED 
probably two of them with the beeps on the cassette tape So the LED with
each beep would go on and off real quick generating a strobe light sort
of effect The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the
rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS And if there was no sound on the tape
except for background his the LEDs would remain off Please help


  Thanks

Does anyone know how the VGA video feature connector operates I

And I assume that pins    are outputs and   
are inputs Is this correct

The reason is this  I have a Rombo Media Pro video
digitising card It chroma keys its output into the vga
monitor signal However although it is supposed to work
with an ET with Hicolour RAMDAC the colours on screen
behave as if the top  bits of colour information are missing
and red green blue signals are swapped around
Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficient
buffering on the feature connector outputs and is happy to
sell me a buffer device for  pounds
I would rather save about  pounds and build my own I assume
it would require for example a F buffer IC or two

Can anyone help Any information on the feature connector would
be highly appreciated

Please could you reply by email

I think a few things are being missed overall here First of all anyone
with a DOS manual can copy a disk or copy anything hidden files dont
go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant off
of a hard disk 'Professional' crackers arent interested in copying disks
They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly
listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number
dialog boxes volume label checks and who knows what when it comes to
computer games 
    
Those people are in the minority however In my experience with the world of
people and software it seems that a good majority of people say  will
at some point copy a friend's program Gee you really oughta try this or
accept a copy These are people who normally would buy a software package
or do without but decided that just once it wouldn't matter

The last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one 
computer most people aren't going to spend   X of computers for the
same software package they will just install it x of times especially
things like DOS upgrades

Are the boards at all intelligent  Ie run by microcontrollers  The
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the PC  When this line was true the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data  This isn't a perfect solution
though since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't
decide to talk at the exact same time

Other than that I think you will need to hook up each board to something
that speaks RS  This actually isn't as hard or as expensive as it
used to be though  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly  BPS
or slower the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data  This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more
than th of the time of for very long since a PIC isn't going to be
able to buffer more than maybe some bytes

You might want to check into the prices of multiserial card for your PC
though  I recently bought a Boca Research x card  parallel ports 
RS ports for a very reasonable

Anyone has experience in this kind of selfdestructing video tapes


I have always thought that if I wanted to send the Police a tape with
a ransom demand on it or send CNN a video tape to see if they wanted
to buy it I would place a small magnet near the takeup spool so the
tape would be erased as it was played Who would think to check

Once upon a time long long ago in this news group someone
posted a schematic for a bit AD converter  Well I just found a use
for the little monster  Anyone out there still got this text file
It had a flipflop a resistor and a cap and a comparatoropamp I 
think  I would be extremely thankful to anyone who could mail me the 
schematic or post it to the newsgroup

That's why you
don't find blue LEDs or for that matter some other colour of LEDs That
is not to say that blue LEDs can't be found  I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering
They didn't emit very much light

Sorry Charlie

I have a dozen VERY blue LED's on my bench right now They have
a clear plastic case and when lit are absolutely BLUE The hue
is sort of a summer day cloudless sky blue but make no mistake
they are blue

You can buy them from Digikey Circuit Specialist Jameco I think
LEDTronics Stanley Optoelectronics and others The current price
is around  each for small quantities I will also be selling
them through my mailorder company in the near future  weeks
Write for details if interested

Hmmm
  A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the
distributor register the copy when the software was sold  The clerk sticks it
in the store PC and asks for the buyers ID Later if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser In addition copies which were
sent to distributorsstores would have a vendor reg  or serial  in order to
track in store piracy

Possible additional program security schemes would be
 having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in
   and registration inconvenient
 taking dire legal action on anyone caught expensive
 encryption crc check self modifying code limited effectiveness
 have an independent watchdog program in the installationsetup config or
   memory manager etc which would check the main program's crc 
   only as effective as above methods at best
 have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked 
   copies of the program andor the offenders hard drive risky and probably
   illegal certainly immoral

my new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented but I thought
if I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective
What is the problem with parallel port security keys I haven't used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes so I don't know what the
drawbacks are I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable
but I've seen cracks of AutoDesk dstudio floating around I don't have one
so don't ask and I had heard that it had parralel port keys

     I'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response 
to the output from a walkman cassette player How could I do this
I don't want it just to turn on I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak
per every beep I put on a cassette tape 

     Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps
on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain
frequency Is there any easy way to do either of these I'm looking for 
the simplest circuit possible I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of
color organ but not quite Let me trt to explain again


     I'm going to have a pattern of beats or beeps on a cassette tape
So on the tape you'd hear   beep pause beep pause beep pauseetc 
 with speed increasing as time goes on I want to synchronize an LED 
probably two of them with the beeps on the cassette tape So the LED with
each beep would go on and off real quick generating a strobe light sort
of effect The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the
rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS And if there was no sound on the tape
except for background his the LEDs would remain off Please help


  Thanks

During my studenttrainee project I discouvered a nice device it's a PSD  
from Waferscale Integration In one single  PLCC I think it was package
it contained ROM RAM IO lines and a programmable addressdecoder

As far as I can recall it can be hooked directly with a MCS series uP  
Neat huh  But it needs programming before assembly so it wasn't suitable
for my project Perhaps usefull for you future plans

To put it bluntly they are full of it

Paying a tape is playing a tape  There is no difference whether the 
output goes to a second VCR or to a TV  How the VCR or TV reacts to 
this signal is a different story  see messages pertaining to macrovision 
copy protection

In order for the tape to selfdestruct it would have to have circuitry 
of its own within the tape case  The circuit would have to somehow 
magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to  The 
circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything

It is a pretty lame scare tactic  I've seen something similar on a BBS
When the SYSOP wanted to he could have a message sent to the user's end 
saying that it is sending the code to format your HD

That's kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do
IMHO it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as
possible AND to sell the customers detail manuals for the braindeads
 quick reference books how to do books and videos paid support hot line
   For the registered purchasers these can be part of their package
I have seen many books to teach people how to use DOS WP and other software  I
I suspect either users can't read the manuals or they don't have manuals
Either way there is  to be made   BTW books are quite a bit more
expensive to reproduce than a  disk

What is the problem with parallel port security keys I haven't used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes so I don't know what the
drawbacks are I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable

With the popularity of Multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems
eg OS Windoze Mack System  it is pretty easy to run a debugger
and figure out the protection schemes by disassemblingtracingtrapping
the application during run time  Schemes like compressed software
special loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers

Hardware keys unless well designed and TOTALLY transparent is a
pain in the bt  We having using a piece of software under Windoze
that uses a hardware key  The key interfers with the printer stuff
with other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software
to work properly

but I've seen cracks of AutoDesk dstudio floating around I don't have one
so don't ask and I had heard that it had parralel port keys

All the hacker has to do is to removemodify code that communicate with
the port

 watt but I need a quite fan  I can use  volt as well but
found just about all  volt fans to be noisy  I also find that
the  v fans are not only quieter but the blade shape has a lot
to do with it  I have a dead fan that was quiet in it's day  It
has long blades like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is
the only way I can describe it  The dead fan is ETRI Model LH
Actually it's not dead it just makes a hideous rattle noise so
it's stealthy qualities are void  Thanks

I need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to
deliver  joules at  volts  the ubiquitous
camera flash circuit is what I want but I cant get mine apart without
breaking it

Charlie Brett's suggestion  buy one of the disposable flash cameras use
the film then take the thing apart  is a good one  Note though that
you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing and it
may be a singlepoint design that won't adapt well to offnominal operation

The things are easy to dismantle  The key piece of information is that
when you advance the film on one of them you are winding it into the
film cassette  it is unwound from the cassette in the factory when
the camera is made  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling  It's
standard film so just take the cassette in for processing

All the camerastore people do when you bring in one of the disposables
is rip it apart toss the film cassette into the tobeprocessed bin
and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in
another  If you take it apart yourself you get an AA alkaline battery
still with a fair bit of life in it and all kinds of little bits and
pieces from the camera

I expect you could even reload and reuse the camera if you were really
determined

   I thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post

Some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries

  One year I left the batteries in the garage  The garage is Unheated  
They were left in their places that they needed to be  One in the riding
lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle  The battery in the 
riding lawnmower was about  years old and one of the cycle batteries 
was new and one was around  years old  Upon spring time I discovered
that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged  They all
worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced 
about halfway through the summer  they had originally been stored
in the garage and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring
  Last year I decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts
one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete  I brought in all three and
discovered in the spring about  days ago that not only were the batteries
dead but when I put the charger on them the charger said HMMMMMMMM and 
the ampmeter read around   In other words it was pinned
the internal circut tripped and I went on to the other batteries  They
were the same  
   Realizing that we still had  GIGANTIC sailboat batteries also lead
acid I decided to put the charger on them  these had been sitting for around  and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only
needed a small charge around  hours or so on trickle  I tested them
by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they
worked fine for around  of 'em 
  This leads me to believe one of several things
      I bought really tty batteries last year sorta true
      the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the
        batteries
      There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the 
          room where the concrete is 
      The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air
         better than concrete

BTW I can almost waterski in the dirt room  

   Any other ideas
    could be the aliens anything is possible

It isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather
which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer
than ground temperature battery

Uh Bob why is the battery warmer than ground temperature  On the time
scales in question and with the considerably reduced temperature swings
several feet underground there isn't going to be any major temperature
difference between the battery and what it's sitting on

 Question  why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the 
surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it

Because the temperature of your hand unlike that of the battery is
determined by the balance between internal heat production and external
heat loss  You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object
your hand which is kept much warmer than its surroundings  In the case
of an object with no significant internal heat production this will
affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings if
it started out not in equilibrium with them but won't affect the final
temperature

For the same reason windchill affects whether you will freeze but not
whether water will freeze

 of them open spread across the bed next to the desk in my dorm and  
 reference them while using the program fullscreen  The Windows Help  
 things come closest to good online documentation I've seen but they  
 generally aren't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of

day here at Drexel while completely board  Most of these circuits are
pretty easy to constuct and can be done by a novice
	This is basically some stuff that could prove useful to you without
having to sit down and either design or buy the stuff not a good word but I'm
tired right now
	Hope you enjoy

	If you have any additions send them to me and I'll add them to the list

 In other words is there some sort of neural network circuit I could build
 after a visit to a local RShack
Marvin Minsky hi there writes of building perceptrons in the s using
motordriven potentiometers to vary the weights He reported that the circuits
worked even tho there were wiring errors Can you say ROBUST

Cadium Sulfide cells vary with light CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID
somewhatlinearyetsomewhatlimiter transfer function often used 
Low power Schottky gates and earlier gates has about a gain of X
LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells even at a
few mA And paper with dark and light regions controlled by pencil and
eraser could also control CdS resistance The very high input resistance of
CMOS gates may let you charge up uF papermylar caps to serve as memory

In article AAkeplerunhedu dmnkeplerunhedu There's a seeker born every minute writes

     Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps
on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain
frequency Is there any easy way to do either of these I'm looking for 
the simplest circuit possible I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of
color organ but not quite Let me trt to explain again

Look for information about  tone decoder chip It is an easy to use
chip for detecting sound of certain frequency You need only one
 and some other componets for each led you want to control
The chip can take the voltage levels which the casette gives
Radio Shack Archer Semiconductor Reference Guide gives good information
how to use that chip It should be simplest way to go The chip costs

  I have seen the existance of electronics solder with a  silver

  Can anyone tell me why it is not used silver is not such an expensive
metal

Hi folks out there 

I don't know whether I am in the right newsgroup but I have a question

If I am completely wrong here in this group could you mail me the right name  
of the correct newsgroup 

A friend of mine is studying electronics at the Technical University in  
KarlsruheGermany since one year

He wants to know whether there are possibilities to study audio control  
engineering in the USA 

Does anybody know how to get information about these studies in the USA 
Could you send me information like emailadresses of the universities  
quality of these studies and so on 

Is it possible to email the universities directly to get information 

Do the universities send information via email 

Please could you answer via email because I don't read this newsgroup  
regularly


Thanks in advance

 services we offered was an engine cleaning remove all that oil BEFORE you
 sell the car   Unfortunately we did not have a high pressure
 washer so we would use one several miles from the shop On more than one
 occasion after washing the engine it would not start as water would have
 gotten under the distributor I would put a plastic bag around it to try and
 minimize this around the spark plug wires etc and it would be nearly
 IMPOSSIBLE to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag The usual
 solution was to carry a can of WD and when the car wouldn't start to spray
 all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time
 
This definately gets the car going but WD is highly flammable Explosive
even in the right conditions like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for
eg And contact points tend to arc a tiny bit 

I once saw the alternatorpoints cover blow completely off a motorcycle after
it had been restored to life with WD fun to watch
It was a Honda MR minibike and the cover is only held on by large rubber 
grommet so it wasn't really a big blast

 Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies  This
is in most cases around the K Hz range  PinkWhite are used to
adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that  There are a few EQ's out
on the market that have Pink noise built in  Most all from Audio
Control have them I know the C does  

Wrong wrong completely wrong and a little misleading too

White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
constant bandwidth That is a  Hz wide band at  Hz will have precisely
the same amount of energy as a  Hz band at  kHz

Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
precentage bandwidth Thus a  wide band of noise at  Hz whose
bandwidth is  Hz will contain the same energy as a  wide band at 
kHz whose bandwidth is  Hz wide 

White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
bandwidths pink noise is used with audiotype realtime analyzers whose
bandwidths are centertfrequency dependent often described as 
octave or  octave or some such terminology

White noise relative to pink noise has more energy at high frequencies
at a rate equal to  dB per octave Pink noise relative to white noise
has more energy at low frequencies at a rate equl to again 
dboctave

 Hi folks
 
 I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining sayi
 that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
 original I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two differen
 processes However I've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I don't 
 want to take the chance even it's small

	Greetings There are  types of warnings on US tapes

	 A hologram is glued across the seam of the  halves of the
	   tape The message usually reads If seal is broken you must
	   buy this tape

	 The standard MacroVision warning Copies of this tape will
	   be unviewable

	 your case Extended message for the Average Consumer tm which
	   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the
	   original I don't believe you can sue them for misinformation
	   in cases like this 

	Take care

	PS Of course  is utter BS  but the Average Consumer tm
	     believes it Heck my mom once returned such a tape without
	     watching it she was afraid that something might just 
	     happen

  I gave up after a year of
  letters and phone calls  I got the impression the FCC was powerless and it 
  was up to the cable company to correct the situation
 
 Isn't there some formal action a citizen can take that requires the
 FCC to at least generate some paperwork
 
  
  Robert Withrow Tel     Fax     Net witrrwwaCOM
  RW Withrow Associates  Railroad Ave Swampscott MA  USA

For those who are interested the FCC does indeed care about cable
leakage particularly into the aviation nav band or leakage that
is causing interference to other services

Part  details specific limits to acceptable leakage and
measurement technique  If you will clearly document your problem
and measurement technique a signal level meter with dipole is the
normal approach remember to correct between measurement data and
microvolts per meter and fax or mail the details to Mr John Wong
Cable Branch FCC  M st NW Wash DC and a copy of your letter
to the local cable company you will get results  In fact the cable
company will probably start treating you much better when they realize
you have figured out how to get the FCCs attention

What is important is to document your case as it relates to the
applicable rules  However the cable company is required to
at least check out every complaint of leakage  They must file
with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement
report that details the results of leakage testing

But remember call the cable company first and give them a
chance to work to correct the problem before contacting
the commission

I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via
the airborne method

 Hi  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
 paper and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
 TV screen at ths of a second  Is that possible

 Might
even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyone's guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited

Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments they used vectortype displays with millisecond
refresh rates common

So your case of th sec is quite practical and the experimenters were
probably sure that it was  milliseconds not  or  either

This has been an interesting thread to follow and obviously this group
wasn't intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy Has anyone seen
any estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates  I was wondering if
piracy is more rampant in Home or Corporate computing environments  I would
tend to think that business environment piracy is the major contributor to
this form of lost revenue  So many companies will purchase a few copies of a
software package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they
owned a sitelicense  What do you guys think

seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late 's

in MTV promos  badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such but
maby that's just because the contrast between the single frame and the
surrounding material was significant  I never believed in the oneframe type
of SP being real

Having vainly looked for devices capable of dealing to the NEC P
DSP chip which dont require taking out a mortgage i decided to roll
my own Not a difficult task for an  given that all the timing
relationships are set out in the databook One thing bothers me that
is the accursed ms  volt Vpp pulse Sure a little buck stepup
converter can achieve this in what is otherwise an all  volt widget
but i know latterday eproms dont need nearly this pulse length
Q  has anyone come up with a more efficient programming algorithm
which is failsafe

 Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies  This
is in most cases around the K Hz range  PinkWhite are used to
adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that  There are a few EQ's out
on the market that have Pink noise built in  Most all from Audio
Control have them I know the C does  
 

With regards to what you wrote how does one adjust for room dynamics 
and stuff like that  I asked a professor that question just
last week and he didn't really know himself  Since pink noise is believed
to be due to surface states say the surface of the Silicon where there's
a lack of a covalent bond that act as traps to nearby elecrons and since
this happens at low frequencies because at high frequencies they aren't
able to trap electrons how do you compensate for that  It seems to me
that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise  I have seen the
pink noise feature however on many EQs and I was wondering
how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to
man made noise like power lines crosstalks coupling etc  If you have
any information about this it would be appreciated  Hope this didn't sound
too drawn out  Thanx

the insides in quite a few years I just saw the post lagging for
quite a few days and thought I'd toss in my  I assume the 
was functionally similar to the  was it also made by MOS
Technologies I really am more versed in the  based Atari
computers The  came later on


The  had some extra ASIC chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks 

It had one custome chip not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood
the TIA sometimes known as the  although most other manufacturers list
that as the CIA complex interface adapter  TIA stands for Television
Interface Adapter and it handles sound paddles and the minimal video hardware
the  possessed

In the Atari computers the CIA chip you refer to sounds an awful
lot like the CTIA Color Television Interface Adapter chip used in
the early models Later Atari upgraded this to the GTIA Graphics
 Other colorful literature stated that the GTIA might have stood
for George the developer of the chip


There was also a standard  RAM IO Timer RIOT plus a voltage
regulator and if memory serves a  timer  That's all

Later model 
might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years

Not according to the servicing documentation I have here  The  did not
change intenally very much at all

Funny I had an old and new model The old one was SIGNIFICANTLY heavier

Additionally I think the  used K K and up to K of ROM for
their games 

ROMS were mapped into the upper K of the 's address space  K and K
games were fine but later K and K games needed bank switching  Atari
and others made much of these huge cartridges

I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with but I
would hazard a guess of  or K RAM 

Sorry I am way out of line here My first microcontroller I built was
a MC based chipset with  bytes onboard That was not easy to
work with in addtion to a small K onboard EPROM

Wrong it had  bytes of RAM from the RIOT  This was multiply mapped into
both page  pseudoregisters and page  stack and also throughout the
bottom K of memory  TIA registers also sat in this address space

As  bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting some later cartridges also carried
RAM themselves which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line
to the cart  This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address
range and the writes into another but all the time this scheme ate into
the very scarce ROM address space

What is the problem with parallel port security keys I haven't used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes so I don't know what the
drawbacks are I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable
but I've seen cracks of AutoDesk dstudio floating around I don't have one
so don't ask and I had heard that it had parralel port keys

If you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack 
them by reading what happens So I've been told I've never seen this done 
but I think it's possible You'd need some hardware knowledge and some 
software to read the port

 What kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects
 The affected equipment is about  feet from the road
 
 Might be a couple of hundred watts from the sound of it  Kicking sound
 out of the TV and stereo speakers by direct RF rectification requires a
 mighty strong carrier  I've heard of linears so powerful that
 triggering them while the car was idling would stall the engine by
 pulling down the battery voltage

It would take a lot more than that It sounds like the radio equipment is
actually not shut completely off  but just goes to a standby situation

I suspect that the stories are just that stories  The voltage can only
be sucked down so far instantaneously When you try to jumpstart someones 
car when your vehicle is at idle does your car stall No the other car
just does not crank well  Now the engine might stall because the idle
was too low to start with When the extra current is drawn the idle speed
will drop  as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the
increased amperage requirement

 Is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company the fcc or both
 
 Ultimately it's likely to be your problem to resolve I'm afraid  The
 FCC is so understaffed that they don't pay much attention to citizen
 complains about RFI or so I've heard they'll just send you a
 pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures
 
 Talking to the power company might help  they might be able to install
 filtering devices at your service panel or recommend a type which you
 could have installed by a licensed electrician

A transmitter is not going to be affecting house power If surges are
occurring there it is due to another cause  not a transmitter

 Unfortunately there's a fair chance that enough signal is being picked
 up by your house wiring that a simple servicepanel filter won't
 suffice  You may need to install heavyduty RFI filters at the power
 connections of your affected equipment

It is probably not that much of a problem Often  toroid coils on the
power leads will solve that part of the interference problem It will
not solve internal equipment deficiencies

 If the problem occurs regularly you may need to stake out the street
 in question and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by
 at the time interference occurs  If you can identify the vehicle which
 is transmitting you may be able to contact its owner and complain

It is probably not the transmitter that is at fault If the person is an
amateur then heshe will probably be willing to help  if you explain
that the person is causing interference

 Not possible either  You'd need about a  amp alternator for

 down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button

Well   amps anyway Transmissions are generally for a short interval
The battery would supply the rest Of course if you transmitted too much
you would run the battery down

It really would not be that much of a brake  Even at  efficiency

 While it's possible that it's a ham radio transmitter that you're
 hearing it isn't likely  every bit of signal that doesn't go out the
 antenna is wasted as far as a ham is concerned and most hams are

It is the radiated signal that would cause the problem

 technically competent to ensure that they don't waste any signal if they
 can possibly avoid it  To get their ham license they had to pass a
 government exam that tests them on that point among others
 
 However you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure  there are
 lots of other services where the operators AREN'T required to be
 technically competent  Citizens Band CB for example

There is nothing in the Amateur Radio Tests that requires an technical
competence at all It is a simple matter to memorize all the questions
and answers  However that said most Hams that I know do spend quite
a bit of time gaining some technical skill

 Listen to the interference  If you hear voices clearly it almost
 certainly ISN'T ham radio and might well be CB  If you can record a

Don't count on that

 bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator's house
 and ask him for his opinion of what you're hearing  Most communities

You cannot do that legally However you can ask a ham over to listen
If the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would
be possible to do such scheduling  If nothing else you could invite
the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes
If he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to
make it immune to rf interference

 have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing
 to help you resolve interference complaints  Look in the phone book or
 ask at the local ham radio store or call the FCC for contact info

The FCC may or may not have such information They have enough to do
without getting calls for such information If nothing else call your
city offices or police department general business number They should
have the name of a local ham contact

 If it's a ham he's more than likely willing to help get rid of the
 problem  After all it would be his signal he's wasting  If it isn't
 the interference committee or the FCC may be able to suggest solutions

See above  your concept of wasted signal is erroneous If his rig is
transmitting properly then the chance of interference with the exception
of harmonic television interference is the greatest  since he is putting
out the strongest signal

 It is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is
 operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a
 piece of consumer audio or TV equipment just because the manufacturer of
 the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device
 that wouldn't affect one person in a thousand but which bites you
 Often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable
 person perhaps even the person operating the transmitter you're
 hearing

Unfortunately most consumer equipment is succeptable  it is all poorly
designed

 BTW hams are ALLOWED amplifiers CB isn't  illegal ham amplifier
 doesn't compute

It does but not for a mobile radio There are very few mobile rigs that
could power a  watt amplifier

	Just thought I would add  to DeskJet thread I got my
first one in college about  or so years ago

	I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for
past  years I got one just a few months after their release And I
got software revision a now I'm up to rev  Our family sister
and father have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go
for one year unscathed their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's
The original DW has gone for  years at moderate personal use I would
say that it has gone through at least  sheets and around one
small ink cartridge every  months or so

	My brother might take this DW now I'm probably gonna give it
to him and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW The chief
advantagesdisadvantages I've found over the years are

Advantages	Quick  ppm Quiet roomate can sleep while it's
printing AppleTalk Networkable unfortunately the original wasn't
so look out if you buy used I rewired our home with phonenet
AppleTalk connectors and while home we can all use my dad's one
DW and cheap now run  BTW you can upgrade older DW's to
color or for appletalk I dunno if HP still does the upgrades but I
received many offers I just didn't ned it however Also crisp
laserquality output is a wonder used to really impress those
ImageWriter DotMatrix people so much so that I had to charge 
per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all
hours of the night

Disadvantages	Ink used to be hard to find and wasn't cheap and
wasn't originally waterproof While HP has done wonders with the ink
I dunno if it's still toxic it is still subjet to smearing and
running if you run around in the damp Boston rain and get your
bookbag completely soaked Ink now runs about  for small carts
I get mine from ElekTek in Chicago I think they're now down to
 The ink carts used to say they're dated for only  months but
I don't think they say so anymore We stick to a  month supply of
about  carts We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper after
fooling for a long time LaserXerox paper is also good Smearing
doesn't happen unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the
paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine
Other disadvantages are  No Postscript this can be an advantage in
speed usually Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press
software solutions I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet but
they won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales

In the end the primary advantages of laser are true postscript
unless you go for cheap lasers and fused toner no smearing even
when soaking in water Lasers are slightly sharper but the only
instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board
Transparencies for PhotoEtching I found a Textronix color Phaser
Postscript Thermal Wax Transfer to work the best to make PCB
negatives directly onto a transparency

Well hope my babbling has helped

stuff about hardware keys

If you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack 
them by reading what happens So I've been told I've never seen this done 
but I think it's possible You'd need some hardware knowledge and some 
software to read the port

True which is why many of the newer keys ship out oh maybe  bits or
so have the key encrypt them and return them to the PC  Making a bunch
of these  bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure
things won't run without the key   Anyway then this scheme at least
defeats your approach  It's a little costly though

Personally I don't believe in copy protection and agree with the thought
that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs
the gains from what few pirates won't be able to copy the program

Which of the  wires that I see is the tip and which is the ring
Please reply to mlevinhuscharvardedu

Mike Levin

Mike Ring is the RED wire Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard
phone lines They two constitute the two wires most often used for
voice telephone the two live lines They are the two innermost
connectors of an RJ phone jack

Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to
GREEN ring to tip tipgreen being at ground potential of the
voltmeter it should read  volts in the onhook noring position
I am  sure it's  V and not  volts Doesn't hurt a phone too
much if they're reversed it's just bad if one happens to somehow get
grounded to earth ground elsewhere

Additionally when offhook the voltage drops to about  to  Volts
DC I think it is supposed to correspond to a  to  mA current
loop And lastly when ringing the two wires develop an AC potential
of about  V pp at  to  Hz across them where you get the
electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from

Hope that clears things

If you want slow LED flash rates adjustable by switches or by a
 digitally controlled switch I suggest looking at a 
oscillator chip They cost  at Radio Shack much cheaper in
quantity at quality places and you will be able to find good info
about simple circuits in a  oscialltor notebook I think Forest
Mims has one at Radio Shack You'll have to toy with
resistorcapacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math
to get the right frequencies Any engineer worth his salt can make a
 osciallator It's in the book and left up to you to see I hate
doing ASCII circuit graphics The  can accurately go from a few Hz
to about  KHz I think

About the Tape Recorder gizmo you could alter a stereo tape deck to
use one channel as a DATA line for flashing LED and one as audio
line for voice or music This would eliminate a lot of noise

The data line is probably most easily done
by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter using just an opamp The 
chip is a good PLL and not hard to work with However if you nothing
about how a PLL works I suggest you don't try this OpAmp
information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack
infobooklets and the popular  opamp is a snap to work with
Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy so I
would suggest the  method firstmost I have no idea what this is
going into so I am really generalizing

As for manufacturing techniques if you're only goofing with it I
suggest you breadboard the thing No need to solder Wirewrap would
be the next more permanent step And lastly solderingPCB making
Hope that clears things

    I thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post
 
 Some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries
 
   One year I left the batteries in the garage  The garage is Unheated  
 They were left in their places that they needed to be  One in the riding
 lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle  The battery in the 
 riding lawnmower was about  years old and one of the cycle batteries 
 was new and one was around  years old  Upon spring time I discovered
 that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged  They all
 worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced 
 about halfway through the summer  they had originally been stored
 in the garage and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring
   Last year I decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts
 one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete  I brought in all three and
 discovered in the spring about  days ago that not only were the batteries
 dead but when I put the charger on them the charger said HMMMMMMMM and 
 the ampmeter read around   In other words it was pinned
 the internal circut tripped and I went on to the other batteries  They
 were the same  
    Realizing that we still had  GIGANTIC sailboat batteries also lead
 acid I decided to put the charger on them  these had been sitting for around  and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only
 needed a small charge around  hours or so on trickle  I tested them
 by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they
 worked fine for around  of 'em 
   This leads me to believe one of several things
       I bought really tty batteries last year sorta true
       the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the
         batteries
       There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the 
           room where the concrete is 
       The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air
          better than concrete
 
 BTW I can almost waterski in the dirt room  
 
    Any other ideas
     could be the aliens anything is possible
  
 
The leadacid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following
chemical reaction
 
Pb  PbO  HSO  PbSO  H
 
Lead and Lead IV Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water
 
The standard heats of formation at  C  F of the various compounds are
 
              Heat of formation
Compound      at  C kcalmole
      
   Pb               
  PbO            
 HSO           
 PbSO           
  H             
 
The heat of reaction at  C is therefore  kcal per mole PbSO produced
Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble  grams per  grams water
at  C and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is
occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery  I am almost
sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but I may be
wrong  Oh well I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate and I don't feel
like thinking through it right now
 
What is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be
is exothermic or energy discharging  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes
acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminals
may form  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds
The reaction is reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery
charger is put back into the battery
 
Leadacid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge  Each
cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction  The nonreacting posts
terminals of the leadacid battery are there to remove or add electric
energy during a discharge or charge  Because the reaction is exothermic it
has a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstances  So
while keeping the battery dry is a good idea it is not a total solution
 
To understand why leadacid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on
concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall LeChatelier's
Principle which can be paraphrased as  anything subjected to some stress will
act to move to a more comfortable position  Here are the thermal conductivities
of a some selected materials
 
                                              thermal conductivity
       material           Temperature C F  BTUhrftftFft

diatomaceous natural                            
 parallel to strata                               
diatomaceous earth powder                       
  density  lbcuft                        
                                                
                                                
                                                
concrete cinder                                 
         stone                                  
          dry                                
pine across grain                                
   parallel to grain                             
oak across grain                                 
maple across grain                               
 
Note that the thermal conductivity for dirt diatomaceous earth goes down
with temperature  Also  C is about  K and the values for earth powder
are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth  The thermal conductivity
of concrete is around a factor of  greater than that of dirt and is 
times greater than wood
 
It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on
concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood  At any instant the
discharge reaction is occurring energy is being released either as electricity
or heat  Thermal conductivity of air is about  BTUhrftftFft
During storage except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on
the battery this energy is mostly released as heat  The higher conductivity
surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity
surface  Thus if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom
surface at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature
the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about  times faster
than that on dirt
 
This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play  Removing energy from
the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion  If the
reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that
temperature requires the removal of any heat produced  A concrete surface is
a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface  Store a battery in the corner
of a poured concrete basement and you have  surfaces removing energy which
pulls the reaction along
 
Also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric
acid to water  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction

This is just basicly right The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger
town there is none that cannot handle tone dialing
And regarding our swedish dialing system a rather screwd up system that does
just apply to pulsdialing Not to touchtone
Btw Norway is even more interesting They got both system So you need different phones depending on where in the country you live

 GA energy within the region of  to  electron Volts According to my

 GA That's why you don't find blue LEDs or for that matter some other
 GA colour of LEDs That is not to say that blue LEDs can't be found  I've
 GA seen 'blue' LEDs sold but they were just your typical visible light

Some phones have a little switch inside so you are able to use them
all over Norway or you can just renumber the numbers on your phone

I have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressed
individually by a microprocessor say x or so  Is there an LSI that
is designed to drive an LED array including RAM to hold the array state
or failing that some way of multiplexing the display so I don't have to
latch a bit for each LED using a discrete latch  I want to avoid having
a huge board covered with s if possible  Thanks in advance

Maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want The MAX drives 
 segment LED displays with full decode or drives  discrete LED's with
a  wire serial interface  The chips can also be cascaded to allow very
large arrays  I am working on a sign display using this part

I'll have to post the contact info for Maxim later it's at home  There was
a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of Circuit Cellar Ink's

Comments about who needs backup copies  and YOU do deleted

I'll toss in my  cents worth  I've begun to think that distribution
disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available
We've been especially plagued by Borland's distribution disks  I'm 
lucky if I can install from them as many as  times before they crap 
out on me  So definitely as a matter of course we ALWAYS make copies
to do our installations with

  This is not a good idea I upgraded my motherboard last fall  I would
 have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to

 Opinion is understandable    I assume you have a tape drive  Not all
 of us have about  floppies around for backup you know  

	Actually no I don't have a tape drive  In the event of a total
hard disk failure I reinstall the apps from originals and restore the data
from the backups I keep of that  With upwards of Mb of stuff on my hard
disk there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape
drive   Would be nice to have one though

 RAM is something you add all the time so no  It's more like BIOS
 manufacturer andor processor type etc  Data cannot be used
 esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette

	Maybe maybe not  Today it doesn't happen as often I would hope
but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade the BIOS
information is going to change at least the date anyway  Tagging the BIOS
manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the
motherboard  This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk
backuprestore

 On the other hand to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as
 Please Insert Original Disk XX as I need file YYYYYY for update   
 It would be perfectly reasonable  Sort of

	As long as it wasn't done too terribly often  Otherwise I think it
would get annoying and the user would go looking for other software

   This is silly  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
 them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk and then
 give them that  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone 

 Of course it is easier  Are you saying then the originals SHOULD allow
 only one install  What is your point

	Of course not  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be
reinstalled the worst thing I want that software telling me is this
software has already been registered to blank and it is against the law to
install it on other machines  Or something similar Access for Windows
does this and it only requires a click on OK to go away  Pretty
nonintrusive but it gets the point across

 What I said was the program should have certain restriction such as the
 restricttoonemachine UNTIL the program is registered with the
 manufacturer  The manufacturer will then supply the
 thenprovenlegitimateuser with a patch that will disable the restriction
 and PROUDLY PROCLAIM the legal copy with the Registered to XXX screen

	This is a great idea  I like the key system that some shareware
products use  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big
software companies to implement this without it getting very
costineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users

	Being in the visualization stage of a circuit design right now
I was wondering what the best way to scale an AC voltage using an bit
digital word is I am thinking of using the common method of sending the
word through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage converted
to a sawtooth wave to get a duty cycle However I am leary of this
method because it a requires a lot of parts and more importantly b
creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line I
realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference
but that would require more parts and boost the price further
	Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 
bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all onchip
Unfortunately he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer
if anyone else has heard of this chip please email me
	I am building this project as a dimmer box for a light
controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains
very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user
wishes to control well each channel at least Therefor if each box
costs  I doubt that an end user will want to dish out  x  
 for sixteen channels This is something I have noticed about
today's dimmer boxes they are so expensive
	Anyway any help which someone could offer on either a method of
easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me always
the preferred method  will be greatly appreciated

For the most part silversolder is not used for general soldering
tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth Silversolder when
exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field will actually
grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically
short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field For this 
reason silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies
Fortunatly tinlead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites
as fast as silversolder Therefore it is used extensively

There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers
available from hewlettpackard  Older original deskjet and
possibly deskjet  units may have a black plastic slide with
rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right
side viewed from front of the printer  Newer printers have a
gray or white plastic slide  The black plastic slide can allow
your cartridge to dry out  There was and may still be information
packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation  HP placed a
coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new
capping mechanism  I did this on my printer and did indeed find
that the cartidges now last longer

I don't have the information handy  I suggest contacting your
nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit

HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical
components that vary depending on the starting level printer and
the level to which you wish to upgrade  I upgraded my original
desket to a dekjet   The kit was fairly expensive  You are
likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new
deskjet  now that prices have declined so much  Upgrading an
original deskjet to  requires a fair amount of skill but no
soldering  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a  is involves swapping
the processor card and changing a few minor parts  Contact your HP
service center for further information

The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from
the PCL used by laser printers especially the newer laser
printers  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a
raster end command after each scan line  This makes no material
difference for lasers but causes the deskjet to print the
accumulated raster  As you might guess the result is hideously
slow printing  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are
still guilty of this particular behavior  From the way Wordperfect
works this would not be easy to change  Windows Wordperfect works
efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'

The PCL dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that
permits a full page  dpi image to be rendered with only one
megabyte of memory  An uncompressed image could be as large as
about  Kbytes but the printer needs about K of memory for
its internal housekeeping  Laserjet IV models support banded
printing that allows incrmental download of the image with
compression in limited memory situations  Deskjet downloadable
fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts

A single page from a laserjet only requires about  seconds  This
is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet
printer  The presumption of course being that the laser printer
has completed its warmup cyle

Until ink chemistry is changed wicking resulting in image
deterioration is unavoidable  I won't use the word impossible but
matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely
Chosing an appropriate paper type helps but does not eliminate the
problem

Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable
components  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges
mitigating the material waste problem to a degree  Energy waste
could use more work  Warmup times have decreased allowing
standby current consumption to be significantly reduced in the
laserjet IV

Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous
silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system  The image
drum is good for approximately K copies  It is a very nice
print engine  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine  Kyocera also has
a neat modular paper source and stacker system

The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower
than any of HP's laser printers  The pickup pressure rollers are
subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out  The
usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper
The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a
single part from HP service  Replacement cost for the transport is
almost   The feed rollers are not separately replacable
though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician
I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer

It depends upon the application which printer is best for you  If
you only print  or  pages a day and are satisfied with the
appearance of output the deskjet is a very good choice  As noted
the deskjet  is my choice for personal use

If your looking for LEDs in the  range forget it Blue LEDs just
recently became available and the materials they are made of are expensive
Maybe in the future they will become less expensive and brighter but
for now it's going to cost you and the output will be limited If they ever
do get as efficient and cost effective as red and green LEDs you're probably
going to see a whole new family of color displays

Abhin Singla
If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder the ideal comunications
would be over a multidrop system like RS  RS boards are available
for PC's probably cheaper than a bunch of RS channels and RS is
cheaper to build onto your satellite modules using only a single supply
pin DIP driver chip  Software at the PC end would be similarly complex
for either RS or RS in my opinion  The higher data rates possible
with RS would permit quasisimultaneous data transmission
Hope this helps

What are people's opinions about laser detectors  Escort makes a
laser detector the Passport  and claims it works fine  However
I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
are lucky  ie if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
detector  Otherwise it won't work  Regular radar of course travels
in all directions hence it is more detectable  Any comments

Escort has a deal till the end of April I think where if you buy
their wideband Passport   X K Ka and laser detectors you'll
save  off of buying them separately  In this case the addition of
the laser detector over the Passport  is only  ie Passport
 normally costs

Not that the question is anything important but I am still curious
Why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green I have seen
a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc Is there a
technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have
not tought about it yet

The green layer is a soldermask and is used to make a finished board
look neat and to avoid solder bridges especially when using wave
soldering or any other mechanized approach I've seen red mask
but most that I've seen are green

A bakelite board will look brown in colour and if the solder mask
is put on looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side
or just one side of the board
A fibreglass board will look green from the side because the green
soldermask makes the board appear that colour If you got a fibreglass
board with no mask it would be a whitishgrey colour
Teflon boards do exist as well but I'm not sure about that one

I'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green so they're
not about to change Also any change in any chemical probably requires
a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards A lot
of companies do not make their own boards they ship them to a real
boardhouse

anyone point me at a design article or whatever showing how to produce
the horizontal  vertical drive signals

Check the station's master sync generator  You'll probably find that
it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't
being used  A couple of cables and you're in business

Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VD
outputs  genlock it to station sync and then feed HD and VD to the
cameras

If neither of these is possible then you'll have to build a sync
separator  Look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators

Hello I'm curious what sort of neat features exist on highend
answering machines today In particular I'm interested in
features of digital answering machines Also what is the
typical amount of storagein minutes for these digital answering
machines

The reason I'm hacking together an answering machine program
for my ZyXEL modem and I'm wondering if I'm missing something
on my wish list

I know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet
Someone taped wires to the carpet and now it is time to move out

Is the solvent the same as what's used to clean up the goop in coax
whatever that is  but it just barely ties this query into 
scielectronics

Thanks for your help
Best regards

 generally  the corrosion is a signal that it's time to send them

Yes very coarse  This is for distance viewing but on a window
Any pointers of suggestions would be much appreciated

What pray tell are you putting together  And what about costs  And does it
have to be transparent as in totally transparent  Or just transparent enough
to allow light from the other side to shine through

Yes it has to be very clear like it wasn't there  And of course cost is

In an earlier article Kasey Chang wrote

 Nothing but if you read my WHOLE suggestion I'm saying that you register
 via MAIL by mailing in your registration card THEN the company send you
 the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card

The problem with this scheme is that when I buy a game I want to play it
THAT daymailing a card to and from California would probably take a week
or more

I didn't say the program is DISABLED did I  I HATE it when people
take my words out of context  I mean that once you have installed it
you cannot DEinstall it without registering it or transfer it to another
machine or SOME SORT OF LIMITATION the author will decide WHICH WILL
BE REMOVED WHEN THE PROGRAM IS REGISTERED  


WHAT

You can't remove it unless you register  
You gotta be joking right
What happens if I get a demoversion of that program install it and then
decide that I don't like it  Do I have to register to be able to get rid
of it  Hell no that is the last thing I would think of
If that is what you mean then you would better make pretty sure that a
statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package


A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is IMHO to allow
anyone to install the program but if they register they get some
additional features enabled  It could mean only one new EXE file needed
to be copied to have got the fullversion of the program
Of course anyone is free to delete or remove that program at whatever
time they like

Still we face the trouble of 'moving' the new EXE file around  That
could be solved by having the user registering him self and get back a
specially marked for him or her a new exe file


As for some sort of limitations here are some suggestions
Limit the size of data that the program can work with
Disable saving the data
Print it out with some defects in the output but be sure to mark them as
such
Let some popup screen appear for ca  secs when the program is started
andor exited

etc
but DON'T have it that you must register to be able to remove it

Hey can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers  Just
a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool  I have the clues 
on type A B and AB already and stuff but these other ones are mentioned 
occasionally and I dont know what they do  I think type D is like a PWM scheme
or something  Thanx in advanced


The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency

Class D amps are PWM pulse width modulation amps which work very much like
switching power supplies I think I've seen these things called class S
before as well They're capable of very high efficiencies and would be suitable
for very high power I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile
amp though  I've been trying to design a threekilowatter for the last year
to be used as an inverter for an UPS but have been having serious problems
with layout parasitics  IRF 's in parallel any help  with a  doable
isolated drive ckt would be appreciated   

I'm not absolutely positive about this but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that
operates off a variable or switched power supply rail voltage The Carver
amps do something like this They use some sort of phasecontrol circuit 
I do not fully understand its operation to reduce the transformer size and
I beleive that is patented I had an M apart trying to fix and found that
it had three rail voltages that it switched between I ran a simulation on
PSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation heat
under largesignal conditions or when driving reactive loads which draw high
current at the zerovoltage crossings

I recently took apart my color Sony TV to clean the volume pushbuttons and

Ahha  I'm not alone at last  Which Sony do you have  I have a
SXR preXBR series circa   That damn thing used to
make noise like a madman  I hadhave  separate problemsone being the
flyback the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke
came together 

First  I found by poking around the windings on that assembly
the thing would make noise  I guess that there was enough of a potential
in that assembly to leak so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation
sprayI think it was urethane or acyrilic  That fixed it

Second  Flybackfor the life of me I can't isolate this one  If I
leave the cover off the TV will be quiet  If I put the cover back on
and let it heat up it'll start to whinekinda hard to solve with the
cover on 

A friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pinhole
leak somewhere on the flyback  Usually it's surrounded by a bunch of
black dustdirt

I hope this is a startif you find something out let me know

 I'm wondering if I can tote my American touch tone phone around with me

 the same  I can buy a different wall plug and refit it I'm sure I'd
 have to but would that do the trick
 
Two things to watch for
In Germany and I think the same holds for Sweden only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing
In Sweden the '' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed down by one position this makes dialing and
in the process converting numbers an interesting task
Otherwise it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
phone to either the German or Swedish phone system
OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that as it is of course
illegal
 

I am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular American phone
on your home system I vaguely remember a few years ago when Deutsche
Bundespost split into Postdienst Postbank and Telekom there was some
discussion about a new regulation I know that cordless or cellular phones
still have to be approved by the Telekom but does that hold true for regular
phones In my areacode in Germany   Frechen near Koeln you can use
touchtone dialing I assume however that most areas are still exclusively
set to pulse dialing Last time I checked Jan ' the Cologne areacode 
was still solely pulse dialing

BTW touch tone does become more common in Germany bringin with it the
flourishing of  services in Germany  I just hope we'll all have
ISDN some time at an affordable price  idle wishes

Why are circuit boards green  The material used to make them goes by two
names  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR  The same
material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a
structural material and is called G  FR and G are both green  They
are not green because of a solder masking agent  The basic ingredients are
a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers  I am not sure what the specs are on
the resin but if you are really curious you can call NEMA National
Electronics Manufacturing Association or Ciba Geigy a major manufacturer
of epoxy resins to find out  As an aside I occasionally mix clear epoxy
and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments
The proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G  They are
the same green color

We use a CDROM based system here  There are about  CDROM disks and a
disk changer hooked to a dedicated MSDOS computer  It contains scanned
images of data book pages for several thousand parts  When you ask it for
something it knows about mostly active IC parts it works quite well
THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist
It is definately a start in the right direction but they need to expand
the data base to handle more types of stuff

These systems aren't cheap  We paid about  for the liscence and get
monthly updates of some of the CDROM disks  We send the old ones back to
them so that they will keep sending us the updates  I think we pay a
yearly maintainence fee of about  to get the updates

If you find the part you want you can look at the data sheet on a
pagesized monitor it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems  You can
also print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer  Page
printing takes a couple of minutes per page  It can take a while to dump
the  or  pages you usually need

I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available
to all Internet users

    I have a mystery part labeled NEC AC  It's from the low voltage
supply of an NEC Multisync I monitor  It's a three lead part in a
square package like a volate regulator or power transistor  The board
is labeled CR where the part goes  Possibly an SCR  The pin
labeled G on the board goes to a zener diode reference voltage the
pin labeled T goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power
supply and the pin labeled T goes to the negative side of the bridge
rectifier in the supply

    If anyone can tell me what this is or better yet where I can buy
one just like it please email me at ckiandrewcmuedu  I've called
NEC's monitor repair number and not only do they not know what the
part is but they don't think that they can find one to sell to me 
It makes no sense to me

Hello

  The last issue of Electronics world describes Ranger  a PCB CAD program
According to the article there is a crippled version available as shareware
does anybody know of any FTP sitesBBSes where this program may be found

Thanks in advance

Just saw an article in New Scientist ATT videophones won't talk to BTI 
videophones The ATT ones use a kb modem BTI uses kb ATT models 
have to communicate using all ATT exchanges whereas the BTI can route 
via most current exchanges Suggestions include building standards converters 
into telephone exchanges  the mind boggles   The BTI design is a bit 
more conservative and is better able to cope with current data compression 
hardware on longdistance lines

not having the magazine to hand I may have misremembered BTI I think it
is a British one made by GECMarconi and currently selling to other
countries

The leadacid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following
chemical reaction
 
Pb  PbO  HSO  PbSO  H
 
Lead and Lead IV Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water
heats of formation deleted
The heat of reaction at  C is therefore  kcal per mole PbSO produced
Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble  grams per  grams water
at  C and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is
occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery  I am almost
sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but I may be
wrong  Oh well I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate and I don't feel
like thinking through it right now

The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution
PbSO is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out  Also HSO
is in a water solution as H and SO  Thus the heats of formation of
PbSO and HSO are for the most part irrelevant

What is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be
is exothermic or energy discharging

As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic heat producing
More about this later

What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this
we're talking leadacid batteries of course
The battery slowly self discharges  As this discharge takes place two things
happen The level of Pb ions in the acid solution increases ie the lead
           and lead oxide plates are dissolved
        The level of H ions in the acid solution decreases ie the solution
           becomes less acidic or more like water if you like
Now as the post to which I am responding correctly stated PbSO will precipitate
in a WATER nonacid solution  When the battery dies ie is fully discharged
we end up with a high concentration of Pb and SO in water  So PbSO
forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY of course this
happens in varying degrees the more discharged the more precipitate forms

The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery  If
there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate
more common in a newer battery a dead short results

I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition but they
are for the most part useless  They can dissolve the PbSO but cannot restore
the lead and lead oxide plates properly  You may have some success with
these products for a newer battery

stuff deleted
To understand why leadacid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on
concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall LeChatelier's
Principle which can be paraphrased as  anything subjected to some stress will
act to move to a more comfortable position  Here are the thermal conductivities
of a some selected materials
stuff deleted
This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play  Removing energy from
the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion  If the
reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that
temperature requires the removal of any heat produced  A concrete surface is
a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface  Store a battery in the corner
of a poured concrete basement and you have  surfaces removing energy which
pulls the reaction along

This stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid
In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher
temperatures  A logical consequence of the above argument is this
If you really want your car to start lower the battery temperature to
  to 'pull' the reaction along  We all know from experience at
 least those of us in Canada do it gets cold up here that this is
not true  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm
the battery

Besides which there is not enough energy released through self discharge
 to appreciably raise the temperature  The air would amply dissipate any
 such heat whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not  This
 is of course irrelevant since you would WANT the battery to be cool
 during storage

Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged

What kind of CSAULFCC approval do  mailorder PC computer
cases and power supplies have  

Can I assume that the certification process for smallscale custom hardware
ie digitalanalog circuitry is reduced or even eliminated if I use
such a case and certified power supply

Also assuming that I use a certified power supply have I satisfied the
requirements of CSAUL approval and possibly FCC approval as well
Do mailorder PC cases satisfy FCC certification  Is FCC certification
even necessary for scientific noncommercialnonresidential use

 What are people's opinions about laser detectors  Escort makes a
 laser detector the Passport  and claims it works fine  However
 I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
 are lucky  ie if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
 front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
 detector  Otherwise it won't work  Regular radar of course travels
 in all directions hence it is more detectable  Any comments
 
 Escort has a deal till the end of April I think where if you buy
 their wideband Passport   X K Ka and laser detectors you'll
 save  off of buying them separately  In this case the addition of
 the laser detector over the Passport  is only  ie Passport
  normally costs 

Uniden makes an all in one unit X K Ka Laser for about 
Colorado Radar sells passive radar jammers the passive supposedly being legal
for about  wont help you with Laser however

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office and I notice that

The data is only ever read once barring mistracks and such of course

Oversampling takes two discrete data points and interpolates n points
between them for n times oversampling  When I asked people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation but significantly more
complicated

You are quite correct in your understanding

In case you care the filtering method uses an FIR finite impulse response
filter  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method  Anybody out
there know the real answer 

	Typical in the old xoversampling units was a thirteentap
FIR implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit  At this kind
of speed slow by digital standards such an adder is much less
expensive than analog components of comparable precision

	I gleaned this information from a hardware manual for
an old CD player design where one would find similar info for
a particular CD the digital filter IS an interesting component
from my point of view I have no idea  The digital filter
is a kind of interpolation scheme read a book on numerical 
analysis to see just how BROAD the term 'interpolation' is

BTW touch tone does become more common in Germany bringin with it the

  I have seen the existance of electronics solder with a  silver

From Management of Electronics Assembly Ian Oakes
After talking about  tin lead alloy and the eutectic point
Occasionally impurities may be added to solder to vary charactersitics 
within the soldering process in an attempt to improve performance  For
example addition of small quantities of antimony and copper can reduce
the amount solder moves under stress when solid  For particular
applications additions of impurities may be warranted but in general it
is best to keep the solder used in a soldering process as pure as possible

I guess this is the good oil for commercial operations but it doesn't
mention anything esoteric

  bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator's house
  and ask him for his opinion of what you're hearing  Most communities
 
 You cannot do that legally However you can ask a ham over to listen
 If the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would
 be possible to do such scheduling  If nothing else you could invite
 the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes
 If he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to
 make it immune to rf interference

As a coupld of people have pointed out  this is wrong It is not illegal
to record or disclose what you heard on the Ham bands

Hello there  The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought
about constructing an oldtime crytal radio set  I figured on
substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal and winding the
antenna coil etc myself

The only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning
capacitor  you know the old meshedplate variable condensers which
used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits  Well these things seem to
be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats  Trimmer
capacitors are relatively abundant but are not really suitable for this
application

So can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 
 pF range

Manythanks

 The color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it
 
 Original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown
 Phenolic spelling was a tan
 Most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green
 Filled fiberglass is blue
 Teflon is white
 

Rubbish The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
mask that is used Older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used
a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them These days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments The light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced The blue and red
or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist
formulation and are applied in a different manner There's a lot of info

        Yes it is possible  I'm making a  stepper controller board 
with  digital inputs and up to  digital outputs from the  port
   One main thing that will tell you whether the  port is 
bidirectional or not is the bus tranceiver on it  Look for a chip 
numbered LS  If you don't have this then it's probably a LS 
which will do you NO good for reading in
  
          Now if you do have the ' then do the following
  First find the address of the port decimal either  or 
  In pascal you would WritePortxxx where xxx is the address in 
either hex or decimal  The status lines pins    as well as the 
strobe pin  are bidirectional lines and are read by base address  
so for  to read from status then read from   You can also output 
to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines  In pascal 
do Portxxxvalue

 
                Hope this helps

NAIL POLISH REMOVER  YOUR WIFE'S PROBABLY GOT SOME HANGIN' AROUND

Oh dear time for me to try to remember my chemistry  Let's see if I
can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind
sounds of gears  fumes of overheated oil  unmistakable stench of
the Nasal Chromatograph   Ha  I knew there was a double bond  Now
how shall I show that in ASCII

          C  C  C  C                        C  C  C
                                                  
              O                                    O

The hydrogens are not shown and  represents double bond  MEK has a
methyl CH on one side and an ethyl CH on the other  Acetone
has two methyls  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone but instead
is dimethyl ketone  Both solvents have similar properties  I think
that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe
It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was  Use acetone

Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone  If you buy
some for your workshop get the very cheapest because the more
expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you don't need

 On benzene and acetone
Not only is benzene a carcinogen it is adsorbed through the skin and cause
cumulative damage to the bone marrow which is essential to the production of
your blood cells  It is highly toxic One exposure is unlikely to kill you
but it will likely do hidden damage  Benzene is one compound that chemists
try like hell to avoid using
Acetone is much less toxic but is highly flammable and volatile 
It also dissolves lots of things so handle with great care

Acetone will likely damage the carpet First solvent to try is denatured
alcohol Do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol You can use methyl
alcohol instead of denatured alcohol If you want to have a cocktail while
you are removing the goo use pure grain alcohol  If the alcohol does
not work try carbon tetrachloride If neither of these work you may need to
try a stronger solvent but the alcohol works for most adhesives Good luck

  Well Bertil you might laugh but in many places here in Austria there are
no wall jacks yet either  just wires sticking out of the wall and put into
a closed often sealed box 
  As far as I remember from Germany it is a nicely mixed situation  somebody
had wires sticking somebody had jacks
  On the other hand everywhere in Bohemia I have seen wall jacks and never
seen just wires sticking out of the wall And I thought Slovakia was the
same case Well

  I have seen the existance of electronics solder with a  silver
content that seems to have good wetting and fatique reatings
  Can anyone tell me why it is not used silver is not such an expensive
metal

   This is called silver bearing solder   It is used to solder to
devices that have silvered contacts   One application is soldering
to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes   These
were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches
If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver
off of the ceramic   The silver was quite thin   The  is a saturated
solution of silver in tin and lead    Thus no more silver can be
disolved in the solder solution   Other devices that use silver contacts
are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers

Subject Re How to the disks copy protected
	I wrote a commercial program called GAMEMAKER can you guess what
it does  What we do is have a document protect answer Question on page x 
line y which is a real pain  We also allow the user to register by sending
in a card and computing a  based on their name  The system works in that
we've gotten lots of registration cards
	I hear that the program has been cracked though  Someone two people 
actually called up my supportone with a question the other wanting to
buy our graphics libraries right  Anyway if anyone wants to help me
catch a cracker and has the cracked version mail me  I won't accuse
you unless you're the cracker of course


I know of at least one ftpsite from which you can download the cracks of
about any commercial game in existence The names of the companies yes
companies are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes According to
them it is not illegal at least in the USA according to a statute or 
something to remove the copy protection from any program The only condition
is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own
convenience

If there is any interest I will download the advertisement of one such 
company I will not give the name of this ftpsite to anyone even if only
to protect the companies which wrote the original games

DISCLAIMER I do not condone the use or cracking of any programs I believe 
it hurts the industry and individuals in the long run

On the subject of copy protection Most pirates don't give a damn about 
using software on which the name of the registered owner came up on starting 
the program They just don't have a conscience

Yes and no I would use the FM transmitter chip from Motorola Linear and  
Interface Databook a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer eg SBL from  
mini circuits lab Everything is done in the FM chip and then mixed up with  
the oscillator frequency Just have a look at the ARRL Handbook There are lots

I know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet

Yet another suggestion but this one is nontoxic although I would handle
it like any other cleaner and it smells nice  The chemical is called
dLimonene and it smells like lemon peels I think it is a lemon extract
of some kind  You might find it in a hardware store sold as a
generalpurpose solvent but your best bet would be any bike store 
it is used as a chaincleaning fluid  It works on sticker glue crayons
grease oil etc

It's clear yellow in the bottle and you can use it straight if you add
water it changes to a creamy consistency which is good for some jobs

Gee how about an ahem accelerometer Such devices are available from
a variety of sources one that comes to mind is Bruel  Kjaer if you have
a lot of money to spend MOst of these sorts of devices output a voltage
proportional to acceleration You need to know what range you're talking
about though

The CD is one of three oscillators that HP made many years ago 
The others were the Low Frequency Oscillator and the Wide Range 
Oscillator These are the ones with the  diameter chrome dial
a Wein Bridge circuit that used pilot lights as the feedback loop
and firebottles that produced many volts of output

I've just acquired a pair of these venerable old beasts 
The nonworking one SN  owned by Crosley Radio at one point
needs help I know I can likely buy a microfiche copy of the book 
from HP but that costs and considering I paid a dollar for
the pair in the rain at the Dayton Hamvention

Does anyone have such a book they could copy parts of for me
Thank you

Rubbish The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder

The May  cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without
any solder mask you can tell from the copper colored traces The box
labeled  transverter has the brown teflonglass board while the one
in the center has the grayish board exposed  On the left is some 
fiberglass board that looks green to me  I see no reason
for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers 

I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
low noise microwave preamps  Often microwave circuits have odd
bits of wirefoilmetal attached to whereverwhatever is necessary
to make the unit work properly this is a commercial product  A
solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher never mind 
the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits  Q dope
for coils does not improve the Qit just holds things together with
minimal loss

mask that is used Older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used
a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them These days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments The light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced The blue and red
or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist
formulation and are applied in a different manner There's a lot of info

         Yes it is possible  I'm making a  stepper controller board 
 with  digital inputs and up to  digital outputs from the  port
    One main thing that will tell you whether the  port is 
 bidirectional or not is the bus tranceiver on it  Look for a chip 
 numbered LS  If you don't have this then it's probably a LS 
 which will do you NO good for reading in
   
           Now if you do have the ' then do the following
   First find the address of the port decimal either  or 
   In pascal you would WritePortxxx where xxx is the address in 
 either hex or decimal  The status lines pins    as well as the 
 strobe pin  are bidirectional lines and are read by base address  
 so for  to read from status then read from   You can also output 
 to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines  In pascal 
 do Portxxxvalue
 
  
                 Hope this helps
         Let me know if you need more help

         A while ago I saw some translucent pads about x or so that 
could be plugged into something and they would glow  One was red 
another green another blue  Interresting  I was wondering if anyone 
would have a feed on anything of this nature and of the price
   oh the pads were rubberlike and were floppy like about cm thick or 
so

The curiosities that you speak of are EL ElectroLuminescent pads  They
are mostly used as backlights for LCD's and as you pointed out comes
in several different colors  Many of them emit whiteish colors true
white and bluewhiteisblue are the ones that I've personally encountered
the most often

They vary in their input requirements however they tend to operate at 
about  Vrms and at much higher than  Hz   Hz to  kHz if I 
recall correctly   You can get them to work at  Vrms  Hz ie
line but they don't glow as brightly and they will degrade much faster
Oh yes almost forgot EL's have this tendency to wear out over time

I know for sure that the Everex Magic IO EVA can be jumpered
for a printer mode or for a general purpose bidirectional IO mode

Also I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following
about the Monochrome Display  Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer
Adapter

    It is essential that the external device not try to pull these
    lines referring to the data lines to ground

And later

    If an external device should be driving data on these pins in
    violation of usage ground rules at the time of an input this
    data will be or'ed with the latch contents

I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind
as a result of my saying I DO NOT know for sure but I think
you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input
port by writing x to the data lines and then reading from the
data lines while an external device drives them''  The input
data will not be latched so noise could make this infeasible

Sorry Geoff

Agree solder mask is green but in the old days we didn't have wave soldering
machines which are another topic again  I had a crew of a dozen ladies which
could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning

Board under the mask was the original query

BTW cheap inport electronic devices mainly from rd world countries are done
with brown pheonolic boards  Is seems the electronics industry has discovered
the cheap labor pools  Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at
home  They are very obviously hand soldered  Quite a few tape recorders are
being brought into Canada from Red China  In China there is no warranty for
the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's yours  One of my
coworkers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was
almost 

Also the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular
printing press  An old lithographer friend had a press for this  After the
etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors

For some time I've been thinking about the possiblity of starting a group
where scientific articles can be published or perhaps just summaries
Possible advantages would be
 Free disribution
 Fast acceptance
 Online discussion between authers and readers

This would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the
articles and one perhaps without for discussion

The best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which
would make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready Perhaps
Postscript or Rich Text Format

But how do you start a new group Anyone interrested

	Just a quick question  What standard lab solvents can be used to
clean electronic equipment and components safely ie not corrode dissolve
shortout etc the equipment
	water	
	methanol
	CCl

You don't say what kind of electronic equipment you mean  It's hard
to give a generic answer  There is essentially no solvent that won't
do things like washing lubricant out of switches

When we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things we've just
used distilled water  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear
is completely dry before powering it up again  We let it dry for
several days to be damn sure

I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water  I would
be very wary of CCl not least because it is dangerous to you even
if it's not going to harm the equipment  not only is it poisonous
but I believe it's now known to be carcinogenic

Not that the question is anything important but I am still curious
Why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green I have seen
a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc Is there a
technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have
not tought about it yet

       It's possible to make boards in other colors and I have an ad
for laser lightshow equipment which offers the circuit boards in your
choice of DayGlo tm colors

       The usual light green color is just the natural color of Fiberglas
The dark green or blue is the solder mask layer and I suspect that color
is a dye

Don't mount it on the side  Call up Crown the company that has the
patent on the PZM and ask them for information on construction and
use of the things  You may have to determine the correct spacing
emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the
design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of
the electret element to increase the high frequency response and you
are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance

Crown has a nice book on the subject though it's unfortunately rather
short on mathematics  There's a JAES article from many years back too

Still for your application you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap
Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a
clean balanced output  Phil's mods seem to get reposted here on a regular

 Regarding pointing an antenna at a leaky CATV cable
 
 Wow what a concept  Does anybody want to speculate on how this
 nonconnection would fit into the theft of cable services laws
 It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
 the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
 stand upon in court
 
 Well the CATV company in the US is accountable to the FCC for how
 much transmission their cables make  In fact I've heard first hand
 about how the CATV company asked to inspect the wiring in a
 homebusiness to find the source of RF leaks  I've heard many of their
 vans have RF detectors and they keep one eye on them as they drive down
 the street
 
 If the cable is leaky enough to have usable signal I would GUESS that
 they're probably in violation of FCC transmission laws
 
 In England they do did require permits to OPERATE A TV
 Supposedly the TV police drove around with RF detectors looking for
 the IF or whatever produced by a receiver that wasn't registered  I'm
 guessing the purpose was just something else they could get away with
 taxing  I don't know if the TV police wereare just urban legend or
 an actuality

The TV Police are still with us I'm afraid A  pound fine goes out to

In England they do did require permits to OPERATE A TV
Supposedly the TV police drove around with RF detectors looking for
the IF or whatever produced by a receiver that wasn't registered  I'm
guessing the purpose was just something else they could get away with
taxing  I don't know if the TV police wereare just urban legend or
an actuality

They are real and we still pay licence fees to receive TV
The detector vans pick up the IF true This tells them what channel you
are watching The can also pick up the line time base freq and frame rate
Try it with a LWMW radio near telly it picks up a sharp hum

From this they can even watch poor quality though what you have on the
screen by picking up re radiating junk

Does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data IO print spooler
digital sampling etc would be better implemented with a DMA chip or a
dedicated microcontroller  Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best
way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a
memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use
by the smart data IO
 
Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use  Fast cheap and easy
to obtain would be nice but I won't limit my choices to only those that fit
those characteristics  Even an  under  would do what I want
but I am sure there is a better alternative  like a microcontroller with
onchip EEPROM
 
So I essentially want to hear about all DMA and microcontrollers that are simple
to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a
few IO lines

For some time I've been thinking about the possiblity of starting a group
where scientific articles can be published or perhaps just summaries
Possible advantages would be
 Free disribution
 Fast acceptance
 Online discussion between authers and readers

This would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the
articles and one perhaps without for discussion

The best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which
would make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready Perhaps
Postscript or Rich Text Format

But how do you start a new group Anyone interrested

comments from Phototransistor experts

We intended to use this atop a stepper motor to provide headings to the
beacons The plan was to have  or  beacons of different frequencies in 
each room and tell the  what frequency to phaselock to We did not do so
One challenge was that the available stepper had  degree steps
Knowing the headings to each beacon we would have used the surveyor 
technique of RESECTION to determine robot location No I ain't going to
explain resection over the net

Given hindsight I would digitize the amplified output of the selfnulling
phototransistor circuit and correlate inphase  quadrature squarewaves at
the several expected frequencies to extract AMPLITUDE of each beacon
By doing this at the numerous steps even with   degree steps with knowledge
of the angular response of the phototransistor you SHOULD be able to
rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon

    I'm wondering if I can tote my American touch tone phone around with me
    to Sweden and Germany  It's DC powered and I can buy a special adapter
    for that in Europe  The question is if the general electronics work
    the same  I can buy a different wall plug and refit it I'm sure I'd
    have to but would that do the trick

   Two things to watch for
   In Germany and I think the same holds for Sweden only some
   of the connections can handle tone dialing so make sure the
   phone can be set to pulse dialing
   In Sweden the '' is the first digit and all other digits
   are pushed down by one position this makes dialing and
   in the process converting numbers an interesting task
   Otherwise it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
   phone to either the German or Swedish phone system
   OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that as it is of course
   illegal

As the phone uses DTMF dialing which by some magic all telecom
operators seems to have agreed on this is a complete nonissue

I don't think there are any switches in Sweden that can't handle DTMF
dialing Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have
been retrofitted with magic fingers that converts from DTMF to pulse
dialing

 I am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular American phone
 on your home system I vaguely remember a few years ago when Deutsche

 discussion about a new regulation I know that cordless or cellular phones
 still have to be approved by the Telekom but does that hold true for regular
 phones In my areacode in Germany   Frechen near Koeln you can use

Yes it does
All the equipment has to have that Telekom approval number to be
legal
What has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else
I'm pretty sure the same holds true in Sweden at least when I read
some information on it about tweo years ago
And BTW I do know that most of the lines in Sweden can handle tonedialing
just don't be sure that all can

 RE Ultrasonic pest repelling devices The ones I've seen use piezoelectric

 insects are actually repelled by these devices Can anybody cite gov't

 I saw another device that supposedly repels pests by altering the
 electromagnetic field of your house wiring I suppose they capacitively
 couple a hi freq signal to the AC wiring And this is supposed to repel
 pests How By magnestriction of the wiring I DONT THINK SO 
 

I've been wondering about this myself  The house wiring thing is really
hokey  There is no doubt that high pressure ultrasound is annoying but to
whom  Given that these devices have been advertised to be effective against
everything from insects to rodents to nasty dogs what is to say that my
insect repeller won't just annnoy my dog and give me headaches  Could there
be that much selectivity in frequencies  Have there been ANY studies
on the effects of various pressure levels bands and sweep patterns on
various life forms

And how effective could they be  I certainly would not want to tell anyone
that they are safe from nasty dogs because they were carrying a piezoelectric
buzzer

I'm trying to build a mixer for a friend of mine to run several things into
a single boom box  I have a circuit that uses an opamp powered by either a
couple of V batteries or using some kind of power supply  But in a catalog
I was looking at recently a passive mixer for guitar was advertised taht
doesn't appear to use any power at all  Does anyone know what the circuit for
this would be because then I could just adapt it for RCA jacks and save my
friend and I alot of messing with batteries and plugs  Thanks

Well the fastest crudest mixer aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly is to run each signal through a 
resistor to a common output  The resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources aren't driving directly into each other 

Taking a wild seatofthepants guess I'd say that if you are mixing
highimpedance sources like some dynamic mikes electric guitar pickups
etc your resistors ought to be maybe K  K or so  If you are mixing
linelevel stuff or the outputs of a Walkman or such I'd go with K

lots of stuff deleted

The leadacid secondary cell discharge reaction is EXOTHERMIC  I am glad
you do not dispute this point  If you don't want the lead storage battery
to discharge it should be stored such that its charged state is the
equilibrium state  During winter the ground be it covered with
concrete dirt or wood maintains a cooler temperature on average than
the surrounding air or the battery  The heat capacity of air is less than
that of concrete dirt or wood so it heats faster  Conversely air cools
faster too

The normal storage procedure for a battery is to leave it in an unheated
garage or basement  The storage surface is often cooler than the
surrounding air with the battery temperature somewhere inbetween  Eg
the basement air temperature may be  F the floor temperature  F and
the battery temperature  F

The air temperature is HIGHER than the battery temperature  The heat of
reaction is not going to move up the gradient  The floor temperature is
LOWER than the battery temperature and heat is going to move to it  The
floor is an incredible heat sink


Might depend on where you live  I know locally for most of the winter
the ground and concrete floor within sheds and garages unheated is
signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature  The air does get
warmer during the day but during the night the ground and concrete
is definitely warmer especially when protected by the walls from the
albedo effect  And the nights are longer by several hours than the
days

Does this imply the German tone dialing is compatible with the American

Bzzzzzt Wrong answer  The UK tone dialling is identical to the US system 
The different settings on your modem are so that it uses CCITT V  V 
tones for data transmission rather than Bell   Bell  tones which are 
used only in the USA and canada AFAIK  As most people now use at least 
Vbis this is largely irrelevant

I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke multimeter
suggests applying WD to the test lead sockets especially the
current range socket  The intention is to prevent the
testleadisinthewrongscocket beeper from going off when there
is no test lead in that socket

The manual is a bit vague but I think I'd apply the WD to a
swab then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly
from the can

Speaking of said meters  I compared the  against the A that
I've had on my bench for almost  years  It has been five years
since the A has been calibrated  On the DC scale they agree
within  mV  AC scale is within about  mV  The  would be
just about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale I
didn't feel it was worth the extra  for a second  since I
don't use dB all that much in my work

I've bothered the rental shops and audio shops about the problem but most of
them have precious little experience in dealing with generated power  My
suspicion is that I don't really need anything larger than KW and this could
all be resolved with a transformer of some sort

Nope  Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the
long cable from the generator or just plain not having enough power  I
would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short
peaks

You can try using larger and shorter cables to the generator or try
strapping the amps for V service and running V mains cables out
which will minimize the line drop  If these don't work though you're
going to need a bigger generator

I assume that you're using wellmaintained generators and have watched the
voltage output on the generator properly  If you don't have V coming out
of the unloaded generator you'll never get V at the other end

Can anyone offer any advice  I want to do a lot of outdoor events this
summer and it would be nice if this power problem could be resolved easily
I've been looking into buying a powerpack so I could tap into junction boxes
directly but have no idea where to start  One that would resolve my
generator problems as well would be of high value to me

I recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of
work and not with the proaudio people  Also I recommend that you don't
try to tap into junction boxes at all but hire a licensed electrician if
you don't really know what you are doing  I've had to clean up after two
people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot A boxes and it wasn't
much fun

Basically I am looking for something to operate in the
ranges of accelerations found in an automobile environment
I would like the device to operate as a trigger for other
systems when the car's deceleration reaches a threshold value
which is how I assume some seat belt lock mechanisms and air
bag deployment systems work

Open up one of the airbag control boxes  They have inexpensive piezoelectric
accelerometers in them  I know that the GM cars use the Setra units  The
cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing
automotive unit

Incidentally these things aren't very linear but for the application they
would do a fine job

While I have gotten  years out of this digital receiver it
has been acting VERRY strange of late  I hope that  the following	
symptoms may help someone diagnose the error

 i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had  has long died
thus if i unplug it  it won't remember the presets

 it has given up listening to the remote  i tried changing the remote's
batteries when i try a remote function  the receiver registers that it
received it a green remote light flashes but the right function
doesn't happen  if any

I just recently realized that I am bisexual and also just recently returned to
religion and have a good friend who has pointed out to me that homosexuality
is a sin in the bible  Well I don't see how it could be considered a sin

First of all as far as I know only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles so you're off the hook there I think In
any event there are plenty of people in many denominations who
do not consider a person's sexual identification of gaylesbianbisexual
as an immoral lifestyle choice

Also I have always been a somewhat liberal feminist and am prochoice and it
seems that being prochoice and being religious don't mix either  I am told

This is another misconception You are not being told the whole story

My former minister is a lesbian and I know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers I am
a UnitarianUniversalist and like most others in my denomination
am prochoice You needn't go looking to the Unitarian Universalists
which is a liberal religion for acceptance of your sexual
identification and prochoice views however there are many of us
who believe in spirituality AND freedom of conscience

Good Luck on your journey

   Not to be too snide about it but I think this Christianity must
   be a very convenient religion very maliable and suitable for
   any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants
   to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and
   reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires  It
   is in fact so convenient that were I capable of believing
   in a god I might consider going for some brand of Christianity
   The only difficulty left then of course is picking which sect
   to join  There are just so many
    
   Dean Kaflowitz

Yes Christianity is convenient  Following the teachings of Jesus
Christ and the Ten Commandments is convenient  Trying to love in a
hateful world is convenient  Turning the other cheek is convenient  So
convenient that it is burdensome at times

 it is patently untrue as has been demonstrated ad
nauseum that the complexity of life is a contradiction of the second
law
My point is that order does not come from disorder

It does not or it can not  When you freze water you've created an
ordered crystal from a disordered liquid  Overall the entropy is
increased but locally order is increased

 the creation od DNA by random processes is incalculably remote

And you find the idea of a god more likely

Besides we can apply the anthropic principle to circumvent any
probablilty problems

Funny there's absolutely nothing in these numbers supporting Jack's
implication that the probability of one protean molecule forming is
less than 

As I recall the figure for just one of the molecules forming is   

lists  steps for determining probability of abiogenesis

Its going to take a little time for me to do this Andy  Hope you'll be
patient 

Just so you understand where I am coming from even though I am a theist
I don't totally reject the possibility that this complex creation could have
just come together on its own  Can I assume you are equally as objective

Most of my discussions on this net which has been very little in recent
years have been with other theists over doctrinal issues  I have rarely
ventured into the origins arena because there is so much speculation 
involved  What hard data there is eg DNA program that in proper sequences
tells the cells how to divide and form tells me that there must have
been a Designer behind it all  

Nonetheless I remain open minded  I wonder how many can claim that on
this net

This is exactly the type of thing I was talking about before A creationist
appears on to makes a completely unsupported statement the facts of
which heshe is completely ignorant is taken to task and finally replies
with a subtle insult actually two insults

Just to make sure I am being fair let's check a few details Jack you don't
know anything about abiogenesis do you this is no sin I know next to
nothing about it either I mean anything other than this  
probability thing which you got wrong in the first post

The speculation involved is really your own isn't it How much biology
do you know even apart from abiogenesis Any classes past high school
Read Chris Colby's FAQ How much paleontology geology etc do you know
Or are you speculating that its all speculative Do you have any basis
upon which to imply that to keep an open mind one must allow that
the earth universe and all the creatures in it could have been created
 years ago None of this is intended as a flame To say that
you don't know a subject is not the same as calling you an idiot I
don't know much about these areas but then I am not the one
calling into question all of mainstream science In other words where
do you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean that
all of physics chemistry etc are also speculative in some sense

You may have in fact not been implying that the rejection of creationism
is a sign of closemindedness or that the theory of evolution is especially
speculative in which case I have merely misinterpreted
you In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclear

Someone writes
I found a list of Biblical contradictions and cleaned it up a bit but
now I'd like some help with it  

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve
Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality an argument
from article length  And the list you have here is of poorer
quality than most  Since the quotes seem to be taken from an
online bible I doubt that there will be much problem with
verses quoted inaccurately  But that isn't the problem here

I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life but none who
denied that there were errors in transmission etc  And many of
the contradictions here  Solomon having  horse stalls in
one verse and  in another  are just the sort of
contradiction that fundies don't have a problem with in my
experience  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount to
anything more than attacking a straw man

Some of the others are just silly or rely on taking quotes out
of context or have reasonable explanations  But even the ones
that are genuine contradictions need to have more said about
them than what is given here  At the very least some effort
should be made to understand and respond to the common replies
given by fundies  Look for example at the research that Dave
Butler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre
That would be an excellent start for an antiinerrancy list that
would have some teeth  One wellresearched and documented
contradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken out
of context and thrown together in a list

Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to
make a bible verse salad just don't cut it  Those of us who
want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing
as embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell

dj

PS You can find some good material at ftprutgersedu in
pubsocreligionchristianotherscontradictions  The quality
is very uneven on both sides of the argument it is just a
compilation of things many people have written but some of
it would be useful in an antiinerrancy FAQ  After exams I
might be willing to help put it together

For a while I was puzzled by the the concept of Adam and Eve coming to
know good and evil  This is how I resolved it  Within God's universe
each action evokes an equal and opposite reaction  There can be no good
without evil as an opposite  So the issue is not what you do but to whom
you give your allegiance  That is why even in this sinful state when we
perform an evil act while we are submitted to God He does not place that
sinful act to our account Rom  In the same vein you can perform all 
the good deeds in the book if your life is not under God's control you are 
still sinning see Rom 

Now take a good look at at an tell me man there is no Christian
Devil There is is real is a virus a meme infecting and possessing
the good people and keep 'em from becoming human beings with emphasis on
the being Is not a matter of good people an evil people is all good
people see but some good people vexed of the Christian Devil An it
can't be burn out or lynch out or rape out Only wise up let I rise up
Christian Devil is real man how else can you explain five hundred years
of history even more Can only be explained by Christians invoke
Christian Devil

 Actually cannibalism is quite widespread  My favorite examples are sand
 sharks and mackerel sharks  The fetuses begin cannibalizing each other and
 the one that is eventually born enters the sea with a full stomache  Would
 you like some more gruesome examples

Fair enough  I'm pretty well aware of the examples used  and mine were very
rapidly and thoughtlessly pulled out of thin air but the point I'm making is
that our noncannibalism doesn't imply any value' over other animals

Did something happen while I wasn't looking  When did Homo sapiens become
noncannibalistic

While mark claims that his honor would demand that he apologize it seems
that he would apologieze if he were wrong which takes seeing that he
would be wrong in some situation or other

Woolfie lupus would be a cool name for a child points out that his
brother would see himself as honorable and not see his mother's point of 
view

My sister has played go between twixt me and my mother since I can't
seem to find words that my mother understands on some issues of boundaries
and such personal things  Not that we dont talk or anything quite so
drastic but that it can be hard to reconsile two points of view

thanks wolfie i see some of your point and mark i may see yours
but it doesnt quite follow the same path to me as wolfe's

Someone posted a list of x number of alleged Bible contradictions  As Joslin
said most people do value quantity over quality  Dave Butler posted some good
quality alleged contradictions that are taking a long time to properly exegete

If you want a good list quantity  When Critics Ask A Popular Handbook On

Do you have any examples of ritual cannibalism particulary amongst the
primates
Why the ritual qualifier

I was thinking of instances were a particular food or foods or drinks
are used to symbolize or ritualize cannibalism Do you know of any human
cultures that have this type of mythology For example where one might
eat a food as representative of the body of a god thus ritualized
cannibalism in the absence of the original

I know of ritual cannibalism among tribes in PapuaNeuguinea 
They used to eat the brain of killed opponents Sometimes these brains
contained infectious agents which lead to a disease called Kuru
Since cannibalism was banished by the government the number of Kuru
cases has dropped sharply

Oh yeah  WellI know of 

Anyways cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong
and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is
PROOF positive that we are more advanced would have us believe  Cannibalism
is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one
alive  Many other cultures including many American Indian cultures eatate
the flesh of slain enemies often as a way of showing respect for the valor of
the departed  Hearts are often favored for this as it contains the spirit

Have you ever read or seen Alive which is the story of the Argentinian boys
soccer team that crashed in the Andes and then ate the bodies of those who died
in order to survive  Finger lickin good  How about the Twighlight Zone
episode To Serve Man

If you want more info on this a good place to start is on scianthropology

Now send me  and eat my flesh

           'Assimilation in US threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'

By Jeanne Huber Mercury News Staff Writer

   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose flames leap up  hours a day from a
gleaming brass urn in a temple  one of only four in the United States 
dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions

   With the flames go the prayers of about  Bay Area Zoroastrians that
their faith will survive this land

   There is a fear  a real fear too said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette
We have one generation to do it or to die

   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land
But for Zoroastrians it is an especially poignant concern

   Their religion has been around for perhaps  years a heritage so deep
it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where historical sites are
sometimes less than  years old  It was the religion of the great Persian
Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius  And tradition says that when Christ
was born about  years later he was honored by a visit from three
Zoroastrian priests the Magi  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians
Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster the
Zoroastrian prophet

   Yet with only about  Zoroastrians in the entire world they are 
a miniscule minority in every country in which they live  Survival as a
people is very much on their minds

   Ironically local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance
of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed
by nearly  years of benign religious segregation could not do cause
their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians

   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion and they
actually shun the notion of trying to win converts  So if their children
become totally assimilated they say it's their children  rather than
the world at large  who will be the losers

   It's important to have an identity said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose
a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India  It's important
for everybody  Irish Scottish Americans  It gives meaning to life
You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect
You can fall back on your own identity

   For Zoroastrians there's much to be proud of

   Their prophet Zoroaster seeking to make sense of a culture in which
animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common preached that there was
only one god a good one  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda which
translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light

Good vs evil

   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil with
the good eventually winning  Men and women could join in the battle for
good he said and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences
such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong  He preached honesty charity
kindness to animals respect for the environment hard work equality of
men and women  basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions

   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to
follow him blindly  He demanded they think for themselves  In fact
Joseph Campbell the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths
traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians

   Zoroastrians have many words for thought  Their motto leaded into a
stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of
Mount Hamilton is Good thoughts good words good deeds

   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly  In India
where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape
persecution by Muslims in Iran Zoroastrians claim  percent literacy
the overall statistic in India is just  percent

   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India
and Pakistan mostly to study at universities  The other half fled from
Iran after the  revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state
where others had no rights

   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on good
deeds has improved life in every country they inhabit  In San Jose
the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because
Manou Mobedshahi a San Franciscobased hotelier passed the boardedup
downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple  At the temple's
dedication the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta the
Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra

   The temple exists because of another good deed the decision by an
Iranian emigre the late Arbab Rustom Guiv to buy land for six temples
in North America  Besides the acre site off Crothers Road on Mount
Hamilton he paid for land in Los Angeles Chicago New York Toronto
and Vancouver  Until his gifts there were no Zoroastrian temples on
this continent

   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple and the
property already had a large house that they have converted to a
community center

   The temple dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet 
Zoroaster is a simple structure with gleaming white walls vaulted 
ceilings and oak floors partially covered with huge Oriental carpets

   Its central feature is the fire set in the middle of a partlyglassed
in area at the center of the building  Although Zoroastrians are 
sometimes called fire worshippers they actually consider fire just 
a symbol of God  It helps us concentrate just like Christians use the 
cross and Muslims use the Holy Book Bhujwala said

   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring  For all
Iranians including Zoroastrians the New Year begins on the first day of
the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life  With
Zoroaster's birthday just six days later the combination of religious
and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the
United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan 

  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday about  people
came to worship and revel

   The good things in life are not forbidden Esfandiar Anoushiravani
a leader of the Iranian members had said beforehand and what followed
proved him right

   Inside the temple worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood
around the edges of the room as about a halfdozen priests chanted
thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking
sandalwood glasses of milk and water and a tray heaped with dried fruit
and nuts

   Kids crowded around grabbing handfuls of the treats  People eat the
fruit Tarapore said  It's a way to participate in the ceremony

Santa Claus sort of

   The gathering even had a Santa Claus Iranian style  With flowing white
hair and a bag of gifts for the children this Amownaroz wore green
symbolic of spring and red

   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown Hajefyrouz who danced and
played a tambourine

   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed  This is all new for us too
one told a visitor who asked what was going on

   A visitor John A Sabanovich of Folsom said he became intrigued with
the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran  Zoroastrians have
no procedure for accepting converts  a result some say of their
centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu
king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his
people's religion

   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the
San Jose temple whenever he can

   When I first heard about this religion he said I thought my God
this is what a religion should be  They think for themselves and do good

   People who don't have a tradition something to lean on what's the
difference with the lower animals

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve
Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality an argument
from article length  And the list you have here is of poorer
quality than most

I agree which is why I've asked for help with it

The reason I'm working on this list is because I've recently had one
too many Christians tell me the Bible contains no contradictions
whatsoever  They believe that it's true and that it describes
reality perfectly and even predicts history before it happens

Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these
people I've got to SHOW them with concrete evidence that the Bible
is not nearly as airtight as they thought  I hope to do that with
this list

Specifically when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two
contradictory creation stories I usually get blank stares or flat
denials  I've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
indeed two different accounts of creation

Kalki Dasa writes

These topics are all discussed in the Vedas In fact the original
knowledge of all these topics comes from the Vedas Therefore they are
not newage at all They are rather old by any standards Nor is the
popularity they are currently experiencing something new One would
think that the Vedas would be very popular among newagers since all
the things you mention above are thoroughly described in them

Isn't that interesting  In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly
wrong  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors
specifically the Patriarch Abraham zl  That knowledge was sent East
to India and China when Abraham gave gifts the commentators to Jewish
scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts to all the rest
of his children when he sent them away to the East  This assured that
Isaac only who remained with Abraham would inherit his most important
spiritual gifts what eventually became Judaism

So you see other religions can have very parochial views too  By the
Jewish view you are very mistaken your scripture are not scripture
your gods are not gods your practices a jumble of errors that lead
people to idol worship and away from God  That doesn't stop us from
respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize
you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner  We're content
to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be  We
are happy to coexist as long as you give us the same right

But your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that
Too bad  Is this typical of your religion

However there is one difference between the newage practitioner and
the actual follower of the Vedic teachings the typical newager
desires to acquire all the material powers and opulences mentioned in
the Vedas without referring to their source the Lord He wants the
kingdom of God without God He wants personal power without the
responsibility of acknowledging its source without the Person from Whom
that power comes In other words he is just plain selfish 

You are a most presumptuous fellow  How dare you presume that the
typical New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish  What trite
selfrighteous egoful garbage  There are Buddhists Christians Jews
and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your
words are simple slander

 The Vedic
follower on the other hand knows that no matter what one desires one
must worship God And the Vedas give a complete description of exactly
who is God so that there can be no mistake in His identification For
this reason the parts of the Vedas that deal directly with the
Personality of Godhead are not very popular among newagers and anyone
who presents the complete Vedas as they are is branded as an
evangelist as if there is something wrong with that even though he
is simply presenting the unadulterated Vedic teachings

Of course from the Jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong  We'd
say that there is no godhead  just created beings who may be
enjoying a good laugh at your expense

A thief takes from others and says this is mine A newager takes
from God and says this is mine Such a false mystic must be careful to
avoid coming in contact with the real owner of the things he has stolen
Consequently he invents an explanation for these things that
conveniently omits the identity of their owner the Lord In other
words he lies about where he got them

So not only are we selfish we are also thieves and liars  And you
expect any of us to pay attention to you and your religion  Why not
call us more name   Maybe then we'll all convert in gratefullness

However the Lord is very merciful and He sends His servants to remind
the newager of his own identity as spirit soul the eternal servant of
God Hence although unwanted the evangelist continues to broadcast
the complete truth

You delude yourself

is getting sick of people bitching about taxes   to  is nothing
compared to the  income tax in a certain country Sweeden  something
like that  My income is small because I'm still a student so my tax
               
percentages could be a little off but  You can afford  or even 
of a  per year income leaving you with guess you can't
afford that new sterio system along with everyone else in the country
so that everyone can have access to decent health care including you
when you lose your job and couldn't afford it if you had to pay for it
all yourself since you can't get as much money back for that  sterio
system as you paid for it
NOTE I don't have any exact figures on the proposed healthcare package
so please don't assume that it would be  of your income as that was not
my point  That was approximate total tax not tax for one thing


Boy is this guy in for a shock when he hits the real world  Our tax rate 
is incredibly high higher than many European countries  it is just
packaged differently income Social inSecurity Medicare payroll taxes
property taxes sales taxes fees mandatory disability insurance state 
federal local etc etc etc  Other countries just haven't found as
many ways to hide revenue enhancers as our clever American politicians

I hope you enjoy the K you actually get to spend from your first K

understand what the words mean  Someone who inflicts pain on themselves
because they enjoy it is a masochist

And no  there is nothing wrong with it  You may think it's gross or
bizarre and I might agree with you here but myyour disgust is not equal 
to it being morally wrong

hudson
If someone inflicts pain on themselves whether they enjoy it or not they
are hurting themselves  They may be permanently damaging their body

That is true  It is also none of your business  

Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian
you are permanently damaging your brain  By your logic it would be OK
for them to come into your home take away your bible and send you off
to reeducation camps to save your mind from ruin  Are you ready for
that  





hudson
And why is there nothing wrong with it  Because you say so  Who gave you
the authority to say that and set the standard for morality

Why

Because 
I am a living thinking person able to make choices for myself
I do not need you to show me what you think is the way I have observed
too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the
rules for me

Because
I set the standard for my own morality and I permit you to do 
the same for yourself  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules

Because
Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you
the right to stop it Hudson  We are all aware that you would like for 
everyone to be like you  However it is obnoxious arrogant thinking like 
yours the IknowI'mmorallyrightsoIcanforceitonyou bullshit 
that has brought us religious wars pogroms against Jews gaybashing
and other atrocities by other people who like you knew they were
morally right





me
What is it with you Hudson  You think you know better than other people
so you want to be able to tell them what they can and cannot do to 
themselves  Who died and made you God  How come I can't do the same
thing  

hudson
Aren't you  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what
to do  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that 

It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with Hudson  It is
a key to getting along in life with other people  It is also a point of
respect  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their
own choices and I expect the same to be returned  You on the other
hand do not trust them and want to make the choice for themwhether
they like it or not

It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency  if you believe that you have 
the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives 
then you must by logic admit that other people have the same right of 
interference in your life  
Yes I know you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that
only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference
However other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of
God and that they are the actual true believers and that you are
acting on your own authority  And so it goes





hudson
Who gave
you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I 
cannot set a moral standard for others


You can set all the standards that you want actually  But don't be surprised
if people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper  

At the most basic form I am not going to LET you tell me what to do
and if necessary I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually
interfere in my life

Now at a more humane level than that I recognize that all people are
sentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason  I also
recognize that they like I appreciate being treated with respect and
allowed to make their own decisions

hudson
These people hurt their own bodies  Why can't they hurt other peoples bodies
too  

me
Because other people might not want to be hurt Hudson  And hurting
them against their will is a violation of choice

hudson
So Why is someone elses will such a big deal if morality is all relative


I don't believe I ever said that morality was all relative

What I said was that I can make my mind up on my own thank you and that 
you don't have the right to tell others what to think

I think that you will find that in most moral systems there is 
a respect for human life and the dignity of the person  It is all the
stuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between 
primitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us



hudson
Maybe the insane lover of pain might reason if other people experienced
enough pain they might learn to enjoy it too  

Fine  There is still the clinical definition of crazy  And this also
involves a violation of free will because the insane lover of your
little example would be inflicting pain on a nonwilling subject

Try again




hudson
You have to have other premises to derive this  

me
No you don't  That is a patently false statement

hudson
You have to have some sort of premise about choice or selfawareness


No you do not  I demonstrated to you the example of the football
team which doesn't require premises about freedom of choice or 
sentienceselfawareness  

As I said you are wrong and you don't seem to know much about moral 
systems  If I were you I would take David Bold's suggestion and do some 
reading on the subject before you try preaching about it

hudson
Yes you do  Who is to say that it is immoral for onesself to experience
pain or to be hurt in some other way  Maybe unpleasant but that doesn't
say anything about morality

It violates free will Hudson



me
You can derive the immorality of hurting someone else entirely from selfish
motives  I can say for example that it is wrong to hurt other people
because that makes them less productive members of society

hudson
Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral

Hudson you are screwing up again  Morality does not I say again DOES
NOT define only right and wrong  It also defines acceptable social
behavior without any overtones of good and evil  Picking up your trash
is not really a rightwrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good
and Evil  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social
behavior  

Your definition of the word morality is what is causing you to trip over 
yourself here




me
And since
I selfish being that I am want to maximize my gains from society I will
not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down
on how much benefit I can derive from society

hudson
Why is your benefit somehow related to morality

Again your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot





hudson
What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced
more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society
Maybe something might hurt society but it would help him immensly

That is irrational thinking  

There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic 
destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing I am not going to let them
execute that idea just because they want to do it 

Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they
have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see
one Hudson  And even then I will only stop him when he interferes 
with me and my life  That is the difference between me and you  you
want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting
you  





hudson
The central character in Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment 
R something or other reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and
stole her money to educate and establish himself financially he could
make a great contribution to society  He reasoned that she was not of 
much profit to society  She just collected rents and hoarded money


One of the central points of any that's ANY moral system is that is
has to be internally consistent  

By killing her the character had to accept the premise that the ends
justify the means  If he accepted that premise then in order to be
consistent he must accept the idea that some day another person may
apply the same standard to HIS life  Now if he is unwilling to accept
this premise which he will not be willing to accept then he has
behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard





me
football example deleted

hudson
Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the
players in the fieldon the court is injured or killed  This freshman
wants to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him  If he hurts
a player on the team it might slightly lessen the chances of the team to
win but he might gain great personal benefit  So operating on purely
selfish immorally selfish motives he arranges for a sniper to shoot a
team player in the leg  He gets to play in front of the talent scout

Did that freshman behave morally

Selfish intentions may sometimes generate apparently moral actions but
not always



Two problems right off the bat

  The problem with your analogy is that it doesn't address the goal
that I started with  winning the game  Playing in front of the talent
scout  winning the game  Try creating the same analogy and keep the
ultimate goal the same will you

  The internal consistency question is also not addressed  if the freshman
wants to do this to other people then he has to accept the fact that
it may happen to him one day  If he is unwilling then he has violated
his own moral standard

hudson
And from a materialistic point of view it could be said that the nervous
system is just matter  What is wrong with producing chemical reactions in
matter  

Because this matter is different  It is alive and selfaware  And it
feels pain  

hudson
If all morality were relative big hairy deal

As I said you appear to be the only person saying that all morality
is relative  Most people I know do hold some absolutes in their
moral system

I personally believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
of free will are absolutes  I recognize that there are some moral
systems around which don't accept this I reject them as dangerous
and antisocial nazism some forms of communism fundamentalist
xtianityno that's not a slam  But for the most part almost
every moral system agrees on these two points




me
and the sky and everything in it everything that was created came out
of God  Everything including this matter is part of God  Therefore is 
it wrong to put parts of God in a test tube and make It go through 
reactions  Isn't that a form of blasphemy


hudson
Generally Christians believe in a CreatorCreation distinction  Other
religions believe in one big whole   I don't accept yor premises

Too bad  I know I'm right so I get to enforce my view upon you whether
you like my premise or not  And since you can't prove otherwise there
isn't even an intellectual basis for your resistance to accepting my
viewpoint





hudson
How long will it be before the as long as it doesn't hurt someone else 
becomes more and more relative until the only rule that is left is 
I will do what I want to do no matter who it hurts

There's a big jump between those two positions and you know it very 
well  Don't play stupid  I realize that you're trying to dispute
what you call popular morality by using what you think is logic
but you're stretching this a bit too thin

hudson
I don't think so  once morality becomes relative it degenerates  I am
saying that reasoning that it is generally evil to hurt other people is bad
though I don't think it is sufficient  


Well then answer me this   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism
as you call it because it has the capacity to degenerate  Obviously
then you would advocate a nonrelative absolute moral system

Whose absolutist moral system do we choose  

How do we come to this decision

What about people who disagree with the chosen moral system





hudson
But if morality is considered to
be relative and this rule isn't based on anything but is just an arbitrary
rule people might abandon it

Fine  I can agree with most of what you typed here  However just because
morality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have to
pick your xtianity as its base

We can start a morality based on dignity of humans freedom of choice
tolerance etc and NEVER EVER rely on xtianity for anything  Just because
someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not
mean that they have to involve xtianity in it  Xtianity certainly does not
have a monopoly on principles of behavior indeed fewer religions are
guiltier of violating their own principles

Why would it be immoral to hurt someone else  

me
Because you wouldn't want it to happen to you

hudson
Why does that make something immoral



Because you are not being consistent  Moral systems must be consistent

A person who thinks they can inflict pain on others but doesn't want it 
inflicted upon themselves has a double standard  And double standards are
a violation of any moral system





me
Morality defines how we interact with other people the rules that we
use to guide our daily affairs  Our conduct towards our fellow man  By
realizing that we don't like pain we can also realize that other people
don't like it either  

hudson
Of course we don't like pain  I don't like brussel sprouts  Are brussel
sprouts immoral

Pain isn't immoral stupid  Pain itself is just a physiological
reaction  

What is immoral is subjecting unwilling individuals to pain

Or brussel sprouts for that matter






hudson
Is it immoral to produce these same chemical reactions in a test tube

me
It isn't the chemical reaction that is wrong bozo  It's making the human
being UNDERGO THE EFFECTS of the chemical reaction  Sorry your cute
little analogy didn't survive for very long under scrutiny

hudson
Why would it be wrong to make humans undergo the effects of the reactions
if humans are composed only of matter  

What humans are composed of isn't the qualifying criteria of whether or
not something would be wrong  




hudson
Is it wrong to make matter undergo chemical reactions

Yes if it is sentient matter



me
Nature is not a sentient force there is no choice involved  Therefore
no question of morality


hudson
I actually heard a geologist entertain the notion that matter had a will
There is some sentient force out there  

Fine  I have also heard that the government is encoding the DNA for 
a new race of superhumans in ordinary drinking water  

What's your point



hudson
If humans are made only of matter then choices are also chemical reactions
so why is choice an important issue

And if that is the case then god is only an idea contained in the minds
of people formed of matter and on printed pages also formed of matter
and does not really exist  

I can do the argumentem ad absurdium just as well as you can but it 
won't prove any points for you or me  Got anything relevant you want to 
talk about or are you just playing cute little games

 lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the
  original basenote  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to
  take Mr Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive
  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine  Hopefully the LDS 
  netters will be amiable in their explanation

Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr Weiss has stated on the origin
of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired I say no good
because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not 
the authors of the Creed were inspired I leave you it will be some time 
before I post again with the following thought authored by Eugene England 
Professor of English at Brigham Young University  Mr England wrote the 
following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine Spring 
 edition

  I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon
  or humanfamily until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other 
  with terms like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative Christian 
  or nonChristian  Hal   When we are tempted to draw a circle around
  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American then exclude
  those who don't fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
  defining characteristic of a good American might be one who doesn't draw
  exclusive circles  that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the 
  central American ideal is by excluding others  And when we are tempted to
  draw a circle around Mormon or Christian to decide who is orthodox
  and who isn't by how much they agree with us it might be well to consider
  that the central pillar of Christ's orthodoxy is our ability to love
  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family

  I recently spent some time in a Christian bookstore in California The
  service was excellent the clerks and customers all smiling neat and
  wellscrubbed and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
  commentaries sentimental fiction and collections of evangelistic sermons
  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking 
  others often viciouslywhether the political left our modern American
  culture or other religions  A whole section was devoted to Cults and the
  Occult and as you might expect Mormonism was right there under the same
  rubric and indictment often by the same authors as Satanism  And I found
  I could either rent or buy in English or Spanish copies of The God Makers
  that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous
  antiMormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the s

  It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety Perfect
  love casteth out fear I John   I have always been pleased that the
  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths though I find a 
  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the
  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoatingand even threats of coercive
  actionas the religious right wing has launched this year against the
  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like
  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the
  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormonspeople who would
  if they had power forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of
  others they believe to be evil


The above sermon was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe
to This People's magazine but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His
arms  

Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles 
of the restored gospelas in the days of Christ the Church does not claim 
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do 
now lead the Church  I for one do not wish to be labelled Christian if 
those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are 
intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret Biblical 
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication 
than mainstream Christianity would give it  Once again being in the 
majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective 
voice is louder  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter 
the LDS Church' interpretation  Using someone elses biased research of truths 
and nontruths whose to say what the mixture is as an authoritative tool to 
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone least of all themselves 
Let us simply agree to disagree and share beliefs through adult discussion 
and conversation thereby uplifting everyone

    to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and
    reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires  It
    is in fact so convenient that were I capable of believing
    in a god I might consider going for some brand of Christianity
    The only difficulty left then of course is picking which sect

Dr England's story deleted it was a nice read the first time 
through

scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication

	It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts 
that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of 
fabrication

	About  years ago National Lampoon had some comic strips 
in them that were drawn by Neal Adams They were called Son o' God comics 
It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible In the comic there were a 
group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn and when one of them said 
the magic word he turned into Son o' God He went from a myopic 
curly headed yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied 
portraits of Jesus  with long flowing brown hair and gentile 
features	

	Now if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus 
and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this 
NatLamp Jesus we would have to say that this was fallacious since 
this Jesus was a fabrication and did not really exist

	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim 
that they are Christian They profess faith in Jesus but the Jesus 
that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the 
NatLamp Jesus was

Paul Hudson Jr hudsonathenacsugaedu writes

I was not directly going to come up with a moral argument for the  existence
of God  Rather I was trying to show the absurdity of atheistic materialist
relatavists trying to embrace some common moral system as though it were
absolute  Man knows in his heart that there is right and wrong  We have
all inherited this knowledge  

No matter how absurd it is to suggest that a common moral system created by
mankind is absolute it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible In fact for the Bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use

The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing
every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it The Children of
Israel were given a very strict set of Moral Civil Judicial and Ceremonial
Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their Society For a Christian the situation is no better

It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo
Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear There may well
be an absolute morality defined by the JudeoChristian God for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man

This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society If we take the
divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways as an example consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer Justice If we take an
agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society with all the danger that this implies Alternatively we could take
the basis of the JudeoChristian morality and interpretextend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live Righteously as many Christian and NonChristian philosophers
have done

Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society I
think the important aspect is the result

The primary problem in human nature is a fragmentation of being
Humans are in a state of tension a tension of opposites Good and
evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind

The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of
being The warring opposites within us are a product of man's
rebellion against God which is described so vividly in the pages of
the Scriptures

Man was created with the order to become a god Those were the words
of St  Basil in the fourth century What he was trying to say was
that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature In the
Eastern Orthodox Church this is called theosis or deification

One can also say that man was created to be whole ie spirit soul
and body operating in unison The story of Adam and Eve is a picture
of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness Theirs
was a harmonious relationship with each other the world and the
Creator That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God
their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable halves Immediately guilt and fear was manifested in
their lives They become bound to hardship toil and suffering  This
is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state

The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness If it
were to receive this selfawareness the knowledge of good and evil
its paradisiac state would also be destroyed

Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of
innocence all the days of his existence on earth Or was the gaining
of selfawareness carefully staged by God who did not desire that His
masterpiece mankind be a blissful idiot

God must have known that for mankind to achieve any kind of moral
value he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites There
is no other way to achieve union with God

Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities
He was the perfectly integrated individual reconciling the opposites
and making it possible for us to be integrated ie to become God
not in His essence but in His energies

The opposites is THE Christian problem The Apostle Paul describes it
with the utmost precision in Romans  And he follows with the
answer to his dilemma in vs

But since there is no honor between the two of them they hold to
their own thickheaded paths refusing to recognize each other as human

By the way Mr DeCenso you really should have looked in the index of your
BauerArndtGingrich Greek lexicon  You would have found that the word in
Acts for lot is kleros not CHORION as stated by Mr Archer and nowhere
in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to Theological Dictionary
of the New Testament by Bromley is the meaning burial plot discussed  It
discusses the forms of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc and the various
meanings of kleros eg plot of land and inheritance but mentions
nothing about CHORION or burial plot Why does this not surprise me Thus
it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference

I was wrong I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar and thus
confused kleros the second to last word in Acts  as being the plot of
land discussed  In actuality it is chorion which is the last word Acts
  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so I
cannot report as to the nuances of the word
 
I don't know if someone else would have caught this though I am sure that
someone would be able to do so but I have an aversion to disseminating
mistakes especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point

Bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of
actually believing Bullinger he replied that I misquoted him
 
 And you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing  Oh dear

 My Reply
 Your misquotes of me are astounding Dave  Read the beginning of this part
of  my response to see what I REALLY said in my posting of this article
 
 Actually Mr DeCenso you said that there was benefit to our argument in
  that it caused to to rediscover Bullinger's exegisis  I did not realize
  that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you were convinced by
  it
 
MY REPLY
Thank you for correcting your restating of my points
 
DB
and Mr DeCenso also replied
 
 Dave these are not necessarily my views they are Bullinger's  WE will
 discuss the land issue in later posts I'm sure  I'm only responding to
this one you have directed re Bullinger's views because it's enjoyable
 
Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such drek
convincinghe should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing
and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of This is what Bullinger
believed not necessarily what I believe So which is it Mr DeCenso Do you
find the exegisis convincing or not
 
MY REPLY
One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and
others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations
raised by various Bible scholars and students alike  When I present MY VIEWS
I will clearly distinguish them from now on
 
DB
Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented
no Greek exegisis at all and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not
referring back to the actual Greek  Thus we find this demand on his part for
quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement
 
MY REPLY
Good point  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory you
have produced only superficial reasonings and observations Nor have you dug
deeper  I'm glad you have begun in this post  I will begin Greek studies on
these passages in more depth than I thought necessary as well
 
DB
It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as
evidence  Now we know what he claims for a standard as he has stated it
often enough
 
 a the text itself
 b parallel passages
 c other pertinent Scriptures
 d historical context
 e historical content
 f other pertinent historical info
 g cultural context
 h cultural content
 i other pertinent cultural info
 j grammatical construction
 k Hebrew and Greek word studies
 l etc
 
But are these actual standards he has used or simply empty hyperbole  Let's
see he has used a and since he is trying to reconcile it to other
passages we see that he has also used b  On the other hand he has
presented no use of
 
d historical context                or
e historical content                or
f other pertinent historical info   or
g cultural context                  or
h cultural content                  or
i other pertinent cultural info     or
j grammatical construction          or even
k Hebrew and Greek word studies remember Archer and Bullinger don't count
 
Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings
 
MY REPLY
Question  Do you find such criteria important  If so do you plan on starting
to use them to the best of your ability or will you continue to present
shallow observations I don't mean this in a bad way
At this point in our debates I have not found it necessary to present a
total exegetical analysis of these passages since we seem to keep beating
around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses  I do not believe
it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re
Judas in Acts and Matthew but I will do my best from this point on to use
several of the above criteria since you desire me to  I hope you will also
It will greatly enhance our study of these passages
 
DB
The only thing he has actually used beyond the passage itself is any other
passage  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is
red herring and his only real criteria seems to be
 
 a the text itself
 b parallel passages
 
MY REPLY
The reason is simpleyou are mistating the passages  You claim that the
PASSAGES contradict one another I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one
another
 They may very well be complimentary as many scholarly sources mention
 Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death as you claim  But we'll look
at your defense of this later
 
Also the reward of iniquity in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the  pieces of
silver in Matthew's PASSAGES  Although you have a valiant attempt later at
stating why you believe it is
 
At this beginning stages in our debates we are laying some Scriptural
groundwork which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis
 
DB
Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage
as he has done with Judas' death is to make it agree with another passage so
that both could be considered correct
 
MY REPLY
One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is
that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these
passages are complimentary  However I see no problem in Tony Rose's
explanation of Judas' death
 

 
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING
HIMSELF IN MATTHEW  AND FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN

 
This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels Many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious irreconcilable error
Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts However this is not the case at
all
Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself while Peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact The two statements are indeed different but do
they necessarily contradict each other
Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall neither does Peter say that
Judas did not hang himself This is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white Both accounts can be
true and supplementary
A possible reconstruction would be this Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom After he hung there
for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process
The fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this
explanation This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined  From the bottom of the valley you can see
rocky terraces  to  feet in height and almost perpendicular
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom
Therefore it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down tearing his body open It is important to remember that we are
not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall
Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself
This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time
On the other hand a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building In this case both are true as both are true in the
case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas It is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event
 

 
Your only reason for rejecting this is I believe your attempt to discredit
inerrancy  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely
Here's what you said in an earlier post
 

DB quoting Tony Rose
 There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom
 Therefore it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks
 on this way down tearing his body open It is important to remember that we
                                          
 are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
 
 was the decomposition of his body before his fall
 
The added text in this version is so heavy that assuming you are truly so
opposed to such tactics you should find it not credible  But you seem to
find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory while clearly rejecting David
Joslin's
 

 
Here you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too heavy for
the passages  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way  You can say
it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that doesn't tell me it
didn't happen nor have you shown why you reject that possibility
 
Questions  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying  Or are they both lying  Or
are either or both of them misinformed  Why do you think there is such an
alleged contradiction  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe
in this respect
 
DB
At present though Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me
 
  You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas'
     death  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas
     died in the hanging
  You claim that the  pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down
     in the temple and the chief priests used is the reward of iniquity
     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with
     therefore there is a contradiction  Prove that the  pieces of silver
     and the reward of iniquity are one and the same
 
Actually I find question  to be a rather stupid request but I will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points  First I would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life  In fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging except in fantasy cowboy
movies and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging
 
MY REPLY
I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect  Today I got a
call re a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital  Hanging attempts are not always successful
 
To assume that because most hangings are successful this one was also is
begging the question if I may quote you
 
Last night listening to The Bible Answer Man broadcast The Christian
Research Institute's show one of the scholars on there used several of these
terms that you use  I am not all that familiar with them  The man on the BAM
show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic  It was interesting
 
DB
This is so prevalent that so that to say a man hung himself with no other
qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself
 
MY REPLY
Qualifiers are important at times as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention
below
Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome  Did Matthew who is the only source we
have re Judas hanging himself state that Judas died as a result  To say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as  A boy age  hung himself  But
he lived  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
discover
 
DB
Now I am not alone in this thought in fact since Mr DeCenso so respects
Christian scholarly including Greek scholars opinion I did some research
 
MY REPLY
Thank you Dave
 
DB
Interestingly not one of the Christian references I read interpreted the
hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide              
 
MY REPLY
 above mine
So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points  What about Tony's
position  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility
 
Also is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong or lying or
deceived in other parts of their books  If so should we do as we have done
with Archer toss them to the side and not value anything they say including
their interpretation of the hanging of Judas  I am sure you would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources
 
You also noted they interpreted the hanging as meaning he died  Although
that is very possibly true do you find that in the text itself  Remember
that's the first criteria we must examine

MY REPLY
I appreciate your doing this research Dave  Maybe we are getting somewhere
in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions  more in depth

DB
In each case these references specifically describe that the interpretation
of Matt  as successful suicide and thus I can only conclude that the
                                        
Greek word apagchwie hang oneself is translated as a successful hanging
 
MY REPLY
 above mine
No you can't only conclude this although as Tony says this was a highly
probable outcome  But Matthew does not state death as being a result
 
The Greek word is APAGCHO  Matthew  is it's only occurrence in the New
Testament
 
In the Septuagint the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus
it's only used in  Samuel   Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to his
city Then he put his household in order and hanged himself and died and he
was buried in his father's tomb             
 
Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel hanged himself Gr Sept
APAGCHO but it explicitly adds and died  Here we have no doubt of the
result
In Matthew we are not explicitly told Judas died
 
Also there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure  It simply
means hang oneself
 
DB
But Mr DeCenso you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable
                                                                     
Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful
 
MY REPLY
above mine
Reputable  You mean ones that have never erred
As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful that can't be done
even by me 
 
As I said in an earlier post
 

Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding Judas' death taking into account several criteria
I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew
 
MAT  Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed
and went and hanged himself But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said It is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the
price of blood And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field to bury strangers in Therefore that field has been called the Field of
Blood to this day
 
First of all notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of
hanging All it says is that he went and hanged himself Luke however in
Acts tells us that and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out This is a pretty clear indication along with the
other details given in Acts  Peter's speech the need to pick a new apostle
etc that at least after Judas' fall he was dead So the whole concept that
                                                    
Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable but not clear

cut


 
I also wrote
 

MY REPLY
 
Here we have a stickler Dave that I have to say I just recently noticed
Let's look at the passage in Matthew
 
MAT  saying I have sinned by betraying innocent blood And they said
What is that to us You see to it
 
MAT  Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed
and went and hanged himself
 
MAT  But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said It is not
lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood
 
MAT  And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field
to bury strangers in
 
MAT  Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day
 
Notice verse Then hewent and hanged himself
Matthew does not say Judas died does it  Should we assume he died as a
result of the hanging                     

What does Acts say
ACT  Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and
falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out
 
ACT  For it is written in the book of Psalms 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate And let no one live in it' and 'Let another take his office'
 
Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' deathSo my line of
reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth rethe two accounts of Judas'
death is thisMatthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died he does
                
say Judas hanged himself but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the
hanging incident               

However Acts seems to show us his graphic demise  Therefore there is no
contradiction between Matthew and Acts re Judas' death'
 

 
MY REPLY
we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
his death  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks thereby bursting open I can no longer assume that to be
the case  Therefore no contradiction  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                         
result of the hanging did he  Most scholars believe he probably did but


 
I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations but
in looking at the texts initially we can't assume Judas died  It is however
highly probable                            
 
DB
By the way while all agree that Judas died from the hanging the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing  One
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as
the correct version in both Matt and Acts  The Biblical Knowledge Commentary
suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted his belly
exploded which doesn't explain his headlong fall or that his branch or rope
broke and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out which doesn't explain
how a hanging man would fall headlong rather than feet first
 
MY REPLY
The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factorshow high the person
was suspended before the fall any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks etc  In a
superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics but Tony in the above quoted
post gave us some
 

A possible reconstruction would be this Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom After he hung there
for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process
The fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this
explanation This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined  From the bottom of the valley you can see
rocky terraces  to  feet in height and almost perpendicular
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom
Therefore it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down tearing his body open

 
DB
Now truthfully I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the
source of the Potter's field prophesy but on the other hand the author is
correct Matthew does make that confusion  Of course a Biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas ie where the
prophesy of the Potter's field came from
 
MY REPLY
Please when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discuss
this with you
 
DB
As to your second question Mr DeCenso you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which Judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal rather
than some other source  I would point out that in Acts where it specifically
mention the reward of iniquity Acts  it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about ie Acts  concerning
Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus  Now I would point out
that when the Bible describes an act of iniquity and then immediately
discusses the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed
 
MY REPLY
Dave we are getting somewhere aren't we
 
ACT  And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty and said
ACT  Men and brethren this Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus
ACT  for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry
ACT  Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and
falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out
ACT  And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem so that field
is called in their own language Akel Dama that is Field of Blood
ACT  For it is written in the book of Psalms 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate And let no one live in it' and 'Let another take his office'
 
Notice that in verse  the word iniquity is not used  Rather it states
that Judas became a guide to those who arrested Jesus
But the writer DID NOT stop therevs  for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry  What part did Judas play in their ministry
         
JOH  This he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a
thief and had the money box and he used to take what was put in it
JOH  For some thought because Judas had the money box that Jesus had
said to him Buy those things we need for the feast or that he should give
something to the poor
 
So now we know what part Judas played  he was a treasurer per se
Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry treasurer
according to John THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of wages of
iniquity  money that should have been put into the ministry but was stolen
by Judas to purchase a field  I believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the wages of iniquity are  What do you think Dave
 
DB
Now since I have given you clear answers and even references perhaps you
could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are instead of asking
me what type I think you are as you did to Mr Joslin

I produced an error last week about CHORION

 By the way Mr DeCenso you really should have looked in the index of your
 BauerArndtGingrich Greek lexicon  You would have found that the word in
 Acts for lot is kleros not CHORION as stated by Mr Archer and nowhere
 in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to Theological Dictionary
 of the New Testament by Bromley is the meaning burial plot discussed  It
 discusses the forms of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc and the various
 meanings of kleros eg plot of land and inheritance but mentions
 nothing about CHORION or burial plot Why does this not surprise me Thus
 it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference
 
 I was wrong I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar and thus
 confused kleros the second to last word in Acts  as being the plot of
 land discussed  In actuality it is chorion which is the last word Acts
   Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so I
 cannot report as to the nuances of the word

I abhor publishing trash I abhor it of myself even more than I do from
others but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject I do
not feel dishonest though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in
this example  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research
specifically on the word  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not
as tough as I first assumed it is not nontrivial by any means and I still am
not competent with it but it is not as opaque as I had thought  It turns
out that while the Index for the BauerArndtGingrich Greek Lexicon renders
each verse in order each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical
order  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable the syntax is
far from clear  On the other hand a GreekEnglish Intralinear Bible makes
things a lot more comprehendable  And yes the word for field in Acts  is
indeed chorion 

Now I've checked several GreekEnglish lexicons

	Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament Louw and Nida
	Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament
	Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament Grimm
	Word study Concordance Tynsdale
	A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings BauerArndtGingrich
	The New Analytical Greek Lexicon Perschbacher

In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as

	A space place region district field area country place 
	land farm estate a bit of tillage and similar meanings

Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about grave As some of these 
books go into great detail I would be very surprised to find that these books 
are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek  I 
think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into contradictions to 
be once again as your friend said it lacking in substance and thus Archer 
is again shown worthless as an expert witness By the way Mr DeCenso I would 
have honorably presented my results on this matter even if I had found them
to support Mr Archer's contentions 

By the way among these lexicons eg Robinson's is the definition of
agros the word used in Matthew  to describe the field bought  The word
agros is defined as a field in the country Chorion is specifically noted
as a synonym to agros  This is significant as it is evidence of how silly
Bullinger's exegisis was which stated that the word for field in Matthew
ie agros is different from the word for field in Acts ie chorion and
thus we must be talking about two different fields Of course you already
admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is but this was a small serendipity
which drives the point home 

So as of now unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise
eg a reputable scholar with reputable references I consider this 
particular issue closed  See Mr DeCenso now you can go on to answer
questions about the denials of Peter the day of the Crucifixion Tyre and 
the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in
discussing the Potter's Field

Mr DeCenso in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas
rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases
those scholars opinion on the subject

 we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
 his death  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
 and hit some rocks thereby bursting open I can no longer assume that to be
 the case  Therefore no contradiction  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                          
 result of the hanging did he  Most scholars believe he iprobably did but
 
 
 I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations but
 in looking at the texts initially we can't assume Judas died  It is 
 however highly probable                   

and 

 Also there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure  It simply
 means hang oneself

Actually if you do further research as to the Greek word apacgw you will
find that it does denote success  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful  As I pointed out I
recently checked several Lexicons

	Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament Louw and Nida
	Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament
	Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament Grimm
	Word study Concordance Tynsdale
	A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings BauerArndtGingrich
	The New Analytical Greek Lexicon Perschbacher

A couple simply stated hanged oneself and a couple were more explicit 
and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging A
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw is
strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down  One of the best
references though Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New
Testament not only stated the translation it gave both the root words the
literal translation related greek words which use the same roots and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature to give
further context  

The word apagchw has two root words gchw is the to strangle root and
the root word apo means literally away This root words is included in
words which denote a transition  It can mean a transition in place eg the
greek word apagello means to send a message  Apo can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death  Robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo which means to kill
In literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle strangle to put out
of the way and implicitly denotes a change in life state ie away from
life to death  So while the word apacgw does mean to hang it
specifically denotes a death as well  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means to hang oneself to end one's life by hanging He then
notes the the use of apacgw in Homers Odessy  to denote context  He
presents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide by
hanging Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling without the
added denotation of death and as you insist that the Bible was written by
God and every word is precicely correct you are stuck with the complete
meaning of apacgw ie Since the word apacgw was used then death is
denoted as the result 

By the way I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of apacgw

 In the Septuagint the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus
 it's only used in  Samuel   Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice 
 was not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house
 to his city Then he put his household in order and hanged himself and 
 died and he was buried in his father's tomb   
  
 Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel hanged himself Gr Sept
 APAGCHO but it explicitly adds and died  Here we have no doubt of the
 result
 In Matthew we are not explicitly told Judas died

Note Mr DeCenso as you say the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to
Greek and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew ie the the
Hebrew say and died and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek 
It should also be pointed out that regardless of the added and died the
correct translation would still be apacgw as the man did indeed die from
strangulation redundant but correct  Further we have evidence that the
Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited which included versions
which contradicted each other and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by Greeks  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it
now stands as a paragon of ancient greek  So what you really need to prove
your point Mr DeCenso is an example in ancient greek of someone committing
apacgw and surviving  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence 

Now I would note Mr DeCenso that everytime I go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis I pretty much find it false  Thus
I think that if you are going to add to the text something over and above
what the source clearly says then you had better have an explicit Greek or
historical source to justify it 

By the way as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field

 There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom

Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old or that
there are  year old stumps there or has a  thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago after all things change 

Now as to your other argument ie that the money Judas used is not the same
as the  silvers

 As to your second question Mr DeCenso you ask how we could be sure that the
 money with which Judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal rather
 than some other source  I would point out that in Acts where it specifically
 mention the reward of iniquity Acts  it also specifically mentions
 what act of iniquity they were talking about ie Acts  concerning
 Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus  Now I would point out
 that when the Bible describes an act of iniquity and then immediately
 discusses the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that
 it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed
 
  
 Notice that in verse  the word iniquity is not used  Rather it states
 that Judas became a guide to those who arrested Jesus
 But the writer DID NOT stop therevs  for he was numbered with us and
 obtained a part in this ministry  What part did Judas play in their ministry
          

True Peter or the author of Acts does not specifically call Judas' betrayal
an iniquity but for that matter neither does John specifically call Judas'
actions an iniquity either  Further John  did not say that Judas took
the money box but rather said

    Some thought that because Judas had the money box Jesus was telling
     him Buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something
     to the poor So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out and
     it was night

Note that it is said that Judas left it does not say that he took the money
box  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity mentioned by another author in a different
book written at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts  I find this forced and contrived 

Of course this particular argument becomes moot since we have have seen
evidence that apacgw means suicide  You see since Judas' hanging was
successful he could not have spent the money mentioned in John  because
Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day ie
Passover and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day  Thus the money which bought the Field of Blood would have to
have been the  pieces of silver Of course he got the  pieces of silver
that night as well and thus couldn't have spent that either  Oh dear I
believe that the house of cards is comming down 

Maybe we should at this point discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on
Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas

By the way as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from ie the
mention of it in Matthew you say

 Please when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discuss
 this with you

I am reminding you now to discuss it now It's all part of the same verse we
are discussing and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping 
these issues

    PS I would note again that you are not stating that that Bible
    is not possibly inerrant you are stating that it IS inerrant
    Since you have been by your own admission presenting merely possible
    reconciliations I of course don't rate them that highly then the 
    best you can do is say that the Bible is possibly inerrant not that 
    it is inerrant

 But Clinton's proposal now sounds like something out of Soylent

 form of hundreds of thousands of publicly providedfunded
 abortions  It's ridiculous  It's offensive  And it's an
 absolute insult to our collective intelligence

We already kill people death penalty and that costs even more
money so you could as well complain about this extremely barbaric
way of justice

But the death penalty is right

      The death penalty is usually administered at the state level
How many federal crimes get the death penalty

And how expensive can an execution be I mean I think rope cyanide
for the gas or the rifles and ammunition to arm firing squads are
affordable

Now perhaps lethal injection might be expensive in that case let's
return to the more efficient methods employed in the past

      Executions are cheap  Appeals are the expensive part

Then eliminate the appeals  Sounds simple enough to me

No doubt you base this on your assumption that a jury of attack puppies
would never find an innocent person guilty

 Seriously though Griffen didn't save the lives of children and he did
 destroy the life of a man so on the most superficial of levels he's scum
 

I almost agree but Griffen is not scum  Scum has no guilt or freedom to
choose anything  Griffen does  God did not make scum when he made Griffen
He made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong  The same goes
for Dr Gunn

 But if you are to examine it more closely Griffen would have preferred that
 these children were born  yet AFTER their birth did Griffen have any 
 assistance to offer them  Did Griffen intend to support them educate them
 raise them up to be useful citizens  Did he have any intent whatsoever
 to help these children after birth
 

Here's the real problem  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs
of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see
straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious
moral decisions based on reality

If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own he is not
considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone  This man has
fled his responsibility has behaved like a lazy coward and has turned
away from his responsibility to his wife and child

However if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden
she is not thought of in the same way  When the man abandons the woman
suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life
When the woman abandons the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed
out and the man has no choice and the man sometimes suffers so badly that
he wishes he could trade places with his child

Ths root of this whole problem is selfishnessthe arrogance that says My
feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung
And when you come down to it this is the substance of what hell is made of
It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his
demons for all of eternity  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven and
we'll ruin it the first chance we get

 Now I don't really know the answer to these questions but I've got a real
 good guess
 

And it's probably right

 And I wouldn't call that 'benevolent' either
 

It is a move in the right direction  As it is now we don't see our
responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight  The media
backs us completely  Real responsibility does not sell  The only
responsibility that sells in the marketplace is that which is just
enough to make us feel responsible without showing anything that
might show us our own true irresponsibility  We want to feel like
good people but we want nothing with being good people  Just give
me the freedom to say I'm good and the rest of the world can burn
Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where
poor old folks rot until they're dead  I'll hate my brother and sister
if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband  Screw the government
because it screws me and don't talk to me about giving to the church
because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites
But I'm a good person  At least I admit what I do  At least I love
myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the worldnot that
a man lay down his life for his brotherThat sounds too christian

At the root this is the substance of what hell is made of

We've become a self indulgant backslidden society no longer responsible
to our children to our parents to our families to our government or
to our God  This is the root behind justification of every evil of every
corruption in government of every slanderous remark of every lie and
of every murder  Society cannot continue to live like this long  it will
have to destroy itsself soon and perhaps in the end that will be the
biggest blessing this world can hope to see

Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around



	I deplore the horrible crime of child murder
	 We want prevention not merely punishment
	 We must reach the root of the evil
	 It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt
	 from the dreadful deed
	 No mater what the motive love of ease
		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent
		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed
	 but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her

RE Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly

                              Sincerely

To your state and national representatives





RE Abortion and health coverage

Dear 


It has recently come to my attention as a result of the current
abortion debate that my health insurance coverage provided by my
employer may include coverage paying for abortions  

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and am
disturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in this
manner  However I depend on my employers' provided health
coverage and fear that if I speak up about it that I may lose
not only my coverage but even my job

I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that health
insurance providers make abortion coverage noncompulsory in
their health insurance program so that it can be declined with
an appropriate reduction in premium

In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in the
health benefit packages between those who would choose to have
abortion coverage and those who would not I further ask that you
include a provision in which the reduction in premium resulting
from the declining of abortion coverage be paidout to the
employee rather than pocketed by the employer  

This second provision should serve to dissuade employers from
pressuring employees into taking one or the other stand with
regard to abortion services  Thank you very much  Your fellow
citizen

                                   Sincerely

is christ's word as quoted by Paul reconciled with current christian
beliefs

Almost one third of the world's population claim to be Christian  But
any similarity between their beliefs and lifestyle to the first century
model is purely coincidental  At Luke  it states nevertheless
when the son of man returns will he really find the faith on the earth

In article qjahhmrshorusapmchpsnide frankDSuucp Frank O'Dwyer writes

Science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round 
as you would wish it  

You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I
see it used normally

And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to
the real world

Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe
and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning
those perceptions

It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see
Values are  well they are what I value
They are what I would have rather than not have  what I would experience
rather than not and so on

Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are
applicable to everyone

If there is no such thing as objective value then science can not 
objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head

I don't agree
Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are
accurate  That is insofar as what I think will be the effect on
my perceptions of a time lapse with or without my input to the Universe
versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be

But values are about whether I like in the loosest sense of the word the 
perceptions 

Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said
to be more useful than a set of tarot cards  

I don't see why
'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy'  period
Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate  or
can't be shown to be accurate
Science is useful because it is apparently accurate

Values  objective or otherwise  are beside the point

No

Not exactly  The prophesy clearly implies that people would
still be living in the area but by the same token it would
never be rebuilt  Obviously  if people are still there they
would live in houses correct  Their nets implies a fishing
village  This is exactly what it has become  a far cry from
its original position of stature 

Looking at  we find that during Roman times Tyre vied with Sidon
for first place in the intellectual life of the period that Tyre was
the seat of a Christian bishop eventually with  dioceses under it
that the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia was the
basilica built in Tyre ca  that Tyre was well known for its
exports of glassware wine white marble and dyed cloth that Tyre
along with other seaports provided outlets for South Arabian Indian
and even Chinese trade that Tyre had to accomodate its growing
population by following a perpendicular rather than horizontal line
of growth because it was running out of land to build on that Tyre
established colonies of its own  None of this sounds like a small
fishing village by any stretch of the imagination

Centuries later under the Abbasids Tyre had opulent and flourishing
bazaars and buildings of  stories  During this period Tyre was
noted for its export of sugar beads and as of old glassware
During the Crusades Tyre was the secondmost flourishing city held
by Franks  There is a lot more but I got tired of writing

In  we read the following description of modern Lebanon other
major cities in Lebanon include Tripoli Sidon Tyre Baalbek and
Zahlah  my emphasis  This source also discusses the impact of
the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli military actions  
on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon  It notes that after Israel's
withdrawel in  Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local
economy

If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present
why is it always called a city or above a major city  Why
does it show up on all the maps   When population figures for cities
in Lebanon are given why is Tyre always one of the cities on the
list even if the list is only a dozen cities long

 Philip K Hitti Lebanon in History From the earliest times to
the present NY St Martins   

 Federal Research Division Library of Congress Lebanon a
country study edited by Thomas Collelo 

In the early 's Tyre had over  people

So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from  to 
Let's assume the latter one is correct  By modern standards
we are talking about a onehorse town

A onehorse town  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse
Anyway Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland  They
may even use cars these days  

The  Encyclopedia Britannica says Pop  est   
Most other references give figures in the  thousand range
One atlas gives the population of Tyre as  the same
source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut also
so I doubt that it is a typo  Perhaps these were figures for
the cities and their surrounding areas  I don't doubt that the
population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades  In
particular the  Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit   

 After Alex the G it fell once more in the 's I believe  What
other times did it fall that you were thinking of 

To Egypt  bce to the Seleucids  bce Rome  bce after
Rome it fell to various Arab contingents until  ce when it was
captured in the Crusades  it was then recaptured again by the Muslims
in  ce and subsequently pillaged then the French Turks British
and today Lebanon

I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed
Don't most if not all of these apply not just to Tyre but to 
the other cities in the area  Sidon for example  Can you make
a case for Tyre having been singled out

Well it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye
Tyrian purple in Roman times 

This is correct but they were under Roman domination and the 
majority of the created wealth was siphoned off  The prophesy
hold true

They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids From 
Tyre received the rights of autonomy from Antiochus Ephiphanes
and from  BC onward enjoyed complete autonomy She started a
large series of coins occasionally in gold 

The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit
your characterization either  And under the Abbasids it seems
to have been allowed to flourish  I still think you are stretching
when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small
fishing village

Who is Josh McDowell

A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low
He happens to quote the same source you quote Nina Jidejian
Tyre through the Ages Beirut Dar ElMashreq Publishers 
The same sentence in fact  He defends the fulfillment of the
prophecy using the same argument you are using an argument that
I haven't seen in print anywhere else which is why I jumped to
the conclusion that you were quoting Josh

I tried to find the Jidejian book but it isn't listed in Books
in Print  Can you tell me more about it Her descriptions are so
much at odds with everything else I've read I'm curious to know why

While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a good thing by posting
that piece of propaganda I believe the more people believe that the more they
will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people  I
have seen the film called The Gay Agenda and along with my church we found
it to be horrifying  Not because of what was actually shown cleaver use of
editting can create any image one wants to portray rather becaseu we are familia
familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people
are actually believing the garbage found within it  The truth is that neither
you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay but knowing as
many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life
I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report something
obviously claimed against gays as well  The truth is that unless YOU are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing  I speak as an
abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society  I do not
support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian
Fundamentalist extremists but I know people who are not the sexual deviants
your report paints them to be  It is no mistake that the APA removed
homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses it is also no mistake that
there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list
I do not feel threatened by gays I don't understand why others are

The following is an article concerning two of the more popular exgay min
istries  Exodus International  Homosexuals Anonymous

THE FOUNDER OF AN EXGAY SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO

by Robert Pela from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE

In December  David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa
awards the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation  As director of FREE
INDEED a national exgay ministry Caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians a way out of the homosexual deathstyle
through prayer  I'd like to give the award back Caligiuri now laughs I'm
no longer deserve it
  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national exgay movement peaked
with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous HA as well
as Free Indeed  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception  There's no reality
in it he says I was selling a product and my product was a lie
  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage the
organizations of the exgay movement rely on the tenents of bornagain
Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals  usually young gay men who
are just coming out  that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing Christianity  We offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality explains Bob Davies director of
Exodus  He ventures that about  of those seeking to abandon their homo
sexuality are men
  Anybody who is involved in the exgay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time says Lisa Seeley a former redeemed lesbian who worked with
Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show  These
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded
  It's possible to change your identity or your behavior says sex educator
Brian McNaught author of On Being Gay But it's really impossible to
change your orientation  These people are no longer calling themselves gay
but they continue to have samesex erotic feelings
  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in  when all
hell broke loose in his personal life  A few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership Caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar  I was really drunk he recalls and I
went home with this guy  He tied me up and raped me  He left me tied up all
night and the next morning he raped me again
  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker he returned home to the
home he shared with his exlover  He had another man there with him
Caligiuri recalls  I thought at this time 'If this is what being gay is
about I don't want to be this way anymore
  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out he would share his discovery
with others  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's
gay pride parade in June  and a few months later Free Indeed held its
first public protest  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance
Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell
  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages  We were listed
under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services Caligiuri says so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard  People would call to find out
where the local bars were and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo
sexuality  Ruses like this are typical of the movement Caligiuri says
adding They'll do anything to reach these people
  David used to go on radio and say really stupid things recalls Peter
Kelly a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors
  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
Raphael's syndicated talk show in   They were relieved he recalls
They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family better
that I should be a 'reformed' gay person
  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed  By the time I appeared on Sally's
show I'd started having sex with men again  Men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin sex with their pastor sex with their
father  I was horny all the time
  Unable to risk going to gay bars where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances Caligiuri says he used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs  When he wasn't working the bookstores he was sleeping
with other reformed homosexuals
  I didn't realize it at first but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex
with one another Caligiuri says  We'd go to conferences in other cities
and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms  Everybody was sleeping with everybody
else
  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 
Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week  When the show's
host asked him if he ever acted on temptation his answer was a lie
  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him however  He was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis a dibilitating
yeast infection and this led to his escape from the sect  I was too sick
to go to church he explains  The more time I spent away from those people
the more I began to feel like myself  I began to remember who I used to be
  Late in  Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry's doors  I'd convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for exgay people he says
  Today Caligiuri  is studying alternative spiritualities I'm interest
ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental considering romance But
not with a CHristian and searching for a new project to devote himself to
I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes he says  I want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I
may have brought to our community

end article

Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of 'exgay' ministries who have said very similar th
similar things  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity but have
come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others  Some
like Chris Glaser director of the Presbyterian Lazarus Project of West
Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay  I have also as I said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as Love In
Action and others who either once claimed to have been reformed or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie no matter who was disappointed
in them  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of sealing their
new heterosexuality only to eventually start hitting the bars bathhouses
and bookstores since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and onenightstands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous sin
through a committed relationship  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people and the very inno
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages  Yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people  heterosexuality or  celebacy  This is sad  What is also
mrtifying is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain
functions  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common
place  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive Christianity toward gays such as Sylvia Pennington's
ExGays  There Are None and others  There are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
Maury Johnston's Gays Under Grace and Chris Glaser's Come Hom  I
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
selfacceptance

I'm short of patience tonite but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  
than the BDs got

Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people

The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act but that was
an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started  War is bad
precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation  That principle
applies to all cases of warfare whether it's between nuclear superpowers
feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt  Why
was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
also have worked  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than
peoples' lives and religious beliefs  Perhaps the supposed professionals in
our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid

It was interesting to watch the  club today  Pat Robertson said that the
Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god He
also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it 
However I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
world had a similarly humble 'cultstatus' beginning even and perhaps
especially christianity  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled  Maybe David
Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
new major religion to me

in the th century about  people lived there so the norms
were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities

I would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the 
small fishing place of Tyre in Acts Again maybe he was a keen
fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre

	It can not be a light which cleanses

   now showing how Brian Kendig is in the dark of the 
most fundamental basic of the Old Testament  Concepts like
santification and Lev  must be foreign to you  Too bad
you are not interested in understanding  Too bad you prefer
blurting folly even to your own shame

  Lev  For the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given
  it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls for it is
  the blood that makes atonement for the soul

The Old Testament was very big on the eye for an eye business  It
makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to repay
moral wrongdoing

I know about sanctification  I've been taught all about it in Sunday
school catechism class and theology classes  But even after all
that I still can't accept it  Maybe I'm still not understanding it
or maybe I'm just understanding it all too well

From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent
man is wrong  I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years
to accept it but I just can't  If this means that I can't accept the
premise that a god who would allow this is 'perfectly good' then so
be it

     What ignorance you can show us next  I guess I'll wait
till tomorrow

If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a good thing
then I would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert me
Be warned however that I've heard all the most common arguments
before and they just don't convince me

Plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

Assuming for the moment that morals are relative then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results

Assuming that there is an absolute morality two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there
is no room for compromise  Once you beleive in absolute morals
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
I'd say that compromise seems to be better

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone

I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source Douglas C
Haldeman from his  book Homosexuality

THERAPY INEFFECTIVE

Recently the founders of yet another prominent exgay ministry Exodus
International denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective
Michael Busse and Gary Cooper cofounders of Exodus International and lovers
for  years were involved with the organization from  to   The
program was described by these men as ineffective    not one person was
healed  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent
feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees many were
driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed reparative therapy

The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE June
  called The ExExGay by Robert Pela

Some personal thoughts

It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major
portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among
its ranks  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition only all
they required was a confession of faith after much torture and then to
save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death  Even
later the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery oppression and
segragation of AfricanAmericans even to the justification of lynchings
Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach  The tool is
still coersion but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind
control convincing people that they should see themselves as less than
God sees them then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt
thier mindconditioning is complete  Sure no one is physically forced
to stay in this reparative therapy but sheer social pressure is enough for
many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of selfhate

As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution
against gays in all facets of civil life  A person should be judged by
the contibution or noncontribution to the society in which they live
not by some highbrow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven't
a clue what is in their heart

For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them
please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG Parents  Friends of Lesbians
And Gays who will be more than happy to assist you  This is a group of
people comprised of Gays Lesbians and Bisexuals their parents and friends
who have formed a support group for help and understanding  Try talking to
a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some firsthand real life and
loving understanding  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no
less abundant

Thank you
PAX

I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned
Tyre  Here's the outcome from the research condenced versions
copyright San Jose Mercury news


  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed  people
and 
wounded  others A car bomb blew up in Tyre killing  people and
wounding 
 A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in 
Nabatiye

  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off

southern Lebanon early today killing the two men aboard the army command 
said
  
     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the 
motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile The
army 
said no one on the Israeli boat was injured The affiliation of the slain 
guerrillas was not immediately known

  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal 
battled Sunday in Tyre Lebanon with machine guns and rocketpropelled 
grenades killing at least four people and wounding  police said

 Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had 
uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said
pro
Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages
  
     Officials of the militia Amal led local journalists through the
catacomb
like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village 
Kawthariyet al Siyad near Tyre the ancient port city about  miles
south of 
Beirut
  
     The officials said they were certain that US Marine Lt Col William
R 
Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road 
outside Tyre in February 

anyway I counted  articles during these  years of reporting I also
found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the
city is defined between  and  It seems that Tyre is one of the
places
where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings so
there's
a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre articles mentioned
thousands of people entering and leaving this place

I counted  articles for my home town Kristinestad so from now I will
consider this place to be a fishing village

A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMAD SAW       
SAW PEACE AND BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM

In His Name ALLAH  Be He ALLAH Glorified
There is Nothing But Glorifies His ALLAH's Praise

In The Name Of  Allah The Compassionate The Merciful

   He is who has sent His Messenger with
guidance and the religion of truth  to make it
supreme over all religion  and sufficient is Allah
as a Witness  Muhammad is the Messenger of
Allah and those who are with him are firm
against the unbelievers and merciful among
each other  You will see them bowing and
prostrating  themselves seeking Allah's grace
and His pleasure  Their mark is on their face
the sing of prostrafion this is their similitude in
the Torah and Indgil the Our'an 

   Since the Nineteenth and Thirhyfirst Words
concerning the mission of Muhammad SAW prove his
prophethood with decisive evidences we assign the
verification of that subject to those Words
   As a supplement to them we will merely show here
in Nineteen Signs some  of the flashes of that great
truth

   FIRST SIGN  The Owner and Master of this universe
does everything with knowledge disposes every affair
with wisdom directs everything allseeingly treats
everything allknowingly and arranges in everything with
His will and wisdom such causes purposes and uses that
are apparent to us  Since the One who creates knows
surely the One who knows will speak since He will
speak surely He will speak to those who have
consciousness thought and speech  Since He will speak
to those who have thought surely He will speak to
humankind whose makeup and awareness are more
comprehensive of all conscious beings  Since He will
speak to humankind surely He will speak to the most
perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and
highest in morality and who are qualified to guide
humanity then He will certainly speak to Muhammad SAW 
who as friend and foe alike testify is of the highest 
character and morality and who is obeyed by one fifth
of humanity to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has
submitted with the radiance of whose light has been
illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries to
whom the believers the luminous segment of humanity
renew their oath of allegiance five times a day for
whose happiness and peace they pray for whom they call
down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in
their hearts

   Certainly He will speak to Muhammad SAW
and Indeed He has done so  He will make him the
Messenger and Indeed He has done so He will make
him the guide for the rest of humanity and Indeed He
has done so

Moral Driver distinctions deleted

In this case the Driver does not evolve but simply Is There would
probably not be any manifestation in an infant  because the Moral
Code has not been learnt yet ie the object upon which the Driver
acts upon 

Without manifestation though how can the Driver be detected For
all purposes it seems not to exist until Moral Coding begins
Actually I agree with your notion of a Driver except that I think
it's not moral but pre and supermoral It is as I mentioned
earlier in this thread a primal sense of connection a pre and
postnatal umbilical the awareness of which is expressed in a
partial fragmented way that accomodates and forms in return the
language and customs of a given culture This halting pidginenglish
expression is I think what we come to call 'morality' 

Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy where there is an urge
and an object The jealousy does not technically exist until the object
is apparent However the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
even though it is not detectable

Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand  but
I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree I think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble though I haven't attempted to
define the reason behind the Moral Driver only hinted through the essence of
each Moral Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality  Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals Is this possible or have I
misunderstood


If my suggestion holds true then this is the area where work must be
carried out to prevent a moral deterioration of Society

What kind of work exactly

Well here you have asked the BIG question 
I have a slight suspicion that you were hoping I would say
something really contentious in this reply from your final question

No not at all I was just wondering if you subscribed to some
particular school of psychosocial thought and rehabilitation and if
perhaps you had a plan I'd have been interested to hear it 


My ps thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and
his writings on Utilitarianism I have no particular plan except to do
my bit  personal ethics AND social work My opinion for what it is worth
is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective I don't think that the
list of Morals has changed for Society significantly though  The Authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models see Eric Berne and his
transactional analysis work  Mavis Klein for references and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term

I've had some more thoughts on my definitions

I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature ie the interplay of
the Moral Code and associated Authorities A suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a HiFi system  the Moral Nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes' and the Moral Character being the
spectrum over time

Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature
because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one's Moral Nature My Conscience fits in more with
Freud's SuperEgo plus the Moral Driver with the stimulous being the
urges or Freud's Id The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego
I suppose If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why
Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained The question is what
provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver I think I need some
more time with this one

That's about it for now

In a previous article davidterminusericssonse David Bold says


I don't mean to be rude but I think that you've got hold of the wrong
end of a different stick

David

I had a look at your posting again and I see what you mean  I was so
intent on explaining how Jung thought we could be more moral than God that
I overlooked your main line of thought

You seem to be saying that God being unknowable His morality is unknowable

Yep that's pretty much it I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the
Jewish way of thinking However the Jews believe that the Covenant between
YHWH and the Patriarchs Abraham and Moses in this case establishes a Moral
Code to follow for mankind Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries
fall though

As I understand it the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was
required whereas the Pharisees the ancestors of modern Judaism believed that
the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of
the required Morality in all its nuances Talmud

The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between
Man and YHWH for a Jew or Christian and does not necessarily indicate
anything about YHWH outside of that relationship although one can speculate


The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created
in His image so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever
moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image  If we
are supposed to live by Christ's example you would be hard pressed to
argue that God is a do what I say not what I do kind of guy

The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the created
in His image means I've heard a number of different opinions on this and
have still not come to any conclusion This rather upsets the Apple Cart if
one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphors
unashamedly As to living by Christ's example we know very little about
Jesus as a person We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives
by his followers and some very small references from comtemporary historians
Revelation aside one can only know Christ secondhand or worse

This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity although it may seem that way
initially the point Im trying to make is that we only really have the Bible
to interpret and that interpretation is by humanity I guess this is where
Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness


Metaphysically if there are multiple moral codes then there is no
Absolute moral code and I think this is theologically questionable

No There may be an absolute moral code There are undoubtably multiple
moral codes The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code As an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is wrong Now the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar where there are no children The wrongness here is if
the child disobeys the parent The parent may feel that it is inappropriate
to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but
you get the gist of it Incidentally the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older see Piaget and learns a morality of his own

To answer your question above why should people who are

 Objective morality is morality built from objective values

But where do those objective values come from How can we measure them
What mediated thair interaction with the real world a moralon Or a scalar
valuino field

Science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round 
as you would wish it  If there is no such thing as objective value then 
science can not objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head
Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said
to be more useful than a set of tarot cards  You like those conclusions
I don't

I think that you are changing the meaning of values here Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word

value n  A fair equivalent or return for something such as goods
or service  Monetary or material worth  Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance merit  A principle standard or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable  Precise meaning as
of a word  An assigned or calculated numerical quantity  Mus 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest  The relative darkness or
lightness of a color  The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound 

In context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best In terms
of scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing

In my mind to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach Science has its basis in observable fact Even the usages of the
word value above do not denote observable fact but rather a standard
of measurement I would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values and so your statement above fails In fact if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements values are based on
systems derived from observation then it must follow that in a
scientific context there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
objective values

Back to the present This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow
Just because the word values is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts

If one is to argue for objective values in a moral sense then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective Considering
the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen

So back to the original question

And objective morality is

If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will
be a good beginning

Did I either ask or assert that  Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again

 Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who
 is next  The Mormons or Jews

Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get
                                 
You are making a ludicrous suggestion

As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

Please allow me to explain myself  In  the governor of Missouri
governor Boggs issued his socalled Mormon extermination order  The
only crime illegal activity the Latterday Saints had committed was
their religious affiliation their antislave stance Missouri still
allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in Missouri

I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow
to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience
brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements

In the s the socalled UtahWar was forced upon the early Mormon
settlers and their illegal activities consisted no less in living as
their conscience dictated and to be sovereignindependant in Utah's
or Deseret Territory as it was called at the time constitutional
daily affairs  In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of
the United States of America an entire army under the command of General
Johnson hence Johnson's Army invaded the territory to restore
Uncle Sam's law and order

History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events
that might appear unrelated but are very much the same in spirit and
intent  That same mob or persecutionprone attitude is to be found in
this usergroup when we tried to organize socreligionmormon andor
talkreligionmormon a whole bunch of charitable believers effectively
blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism
et al in an appropriate forum  We really must be a threat to various
establishments  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa
tion also belongs in the category of persecution  It is ironic that those
who oppose us point to all kinds of justifications to do so despite
their claims of adhering to a gospel of love

In any regard Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from
being trusted or righteous  Have things really changed for the better  I
may be a born cynic but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case In the early s I believe the late President Kimball lds church
leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MXPeace Keeper
missile maze from being built in Utah yet another inspired decision from
secular authorities  Fortunately his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off

Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government I do but NOT without
questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
resolves  The government's actions around the Mt Carmel compound in Waco
was NOT wise neither was it necessary  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with
John I too wonder who or what's next

 We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise
 of their rights to worship and bear arms  Now we don't

Does that include the right to murder little children  How about killing
ATF officers  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas but
Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades grenade launchers and rocket
launchers  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under
right to bear arms

Who killed who  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound
What REALLY caused the murder of the little children  Could it be that
the ATFFBI presence has any bearing upon the events  How would you
interpret the Mt Masada events  Blame the Jews  What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway  What business did the ATFFBI has in Waco
Texas  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

David Koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the
executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers
may have been regrettable but alas necessary to serve some dubious
publicnational interest I guess they are still figuring it out how to
sell this one to the nation

 Of course to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record  It has
 happened before

Please explain  I do not remember Jews or Mormons as a group overtly
breaking a judicious aka nonNazi law and being punished for it

ReadYourHistory  It HAS happened as explained above in some detail
and will undoubtedly happen again Indeed WHO IS NEXT  Socalled Illegal
activities can be twisted and bend to suit anyone's need including the
agendas of secular authorities

 I'll bet all you cult haters are happy now right  Just hope you're
not next

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expectsfears one might need
If one is opposed to abortion one should not be required to pay for
coverage of it because one will NEVER want to use that service and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder

Don't understand the concept of insurance do you Anthony

What is insurance for

To spread the cost of illnessaccidentetc that does occur in a small
percentage of cases over many  Those who do not face the accidentetc
have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did those
who do face the accidentetc are not devestated financially anyhow

Subject    Catholic Right  Pat Robertson
Lines 

The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line
up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition
Former Secretary of Education William Bennet a Roman Catholic stood
beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 
conference in Washington  The purpose of the conference was to
publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed
to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it
backed away from the Family Values positons of the ' convention

Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization
with political expertise legal assistance and high tech communications
support

The Catholic Campaign for  American designed as a Catholic version
of the Moral Majority was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes
Ms Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom
Council in  and worked for him in his presidential bid in 

Ms Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate Tom Monaghan in 
to manage Legatus a nonpolitical Catholic businessmen's group
Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least 
million in annual revenues  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts
at Legatus Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the
Catholic Campaign

The Campaign's list of national committee members includes US Rep
Robert K Dornan Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum the lovely
Pat Buchanan and Rev Richard J Neuhaus   Also on the national
committee is Keith Fournier a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's
American Center for Law and Justice  Another Catholic Thomas
Patrick Monaghan senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ is also an
active supporter of the Catholic Campaign

The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare broadcasting exec
and former US ambassador to the Pope Wall Street executive Frank
Lynch former Reagan official Richard V Allen Bishop Rene Gracida
of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork wife of unsuccessful Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork

In the Winter  issue of Campaign Update the organization's
quarterly newsletter Rocco L Martino a Philadelphia business
executive wrote Separation of church and state is a false premise
that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of
our constitution

Oh yes the organization's national ecclesisatical advisor is
Catholic politician Cardinal John J O'Connor of New York

 as I recall I first entered the fray on this matter in response to
 an assertion by Simon Clippingdale that morality was relative

Oops Quite right I got so busy that I saved Frank's last post back then
intending to respond when I could and I sort of forgot I'll try to do it
soon if anyone's still interested and probably even if they're not

 Is he therefore trying to sell something  I don't think so 

Well yes maybe I am I'm trying to have people buy and take on my opinions
thus causing said opinions to spread in timehonoured memetic virus mode until
the world is a veritable paradise So how about it folks As they say over

Hmmmm  Define objective morality  Well depends upon who you talk to
Some say it means you can't have your hair over your ears and others say
it means Stryper is acceptable  I would say that general principles
of objective morality would be listed in one or two places

Ten Commandments

Sayings of Jesus

the first depends on whether you trust the Bible 

the second depends on both whether you think Jesus is God and whether
  you think we have accurate copies of the NT

Gong

Take a moment and look at what you just wrote First you defined
an objective morality and then you qualified this objective morality
with subjective justifications Do you see the error in this

Sorry you have just disqualified yourself but please play again

 Objective morality is morality built from objective values

You now pushed down the defintion of objectivity into realm of
objective values So you need to explain that as well as well
as the objective subparts the objective atoms quarks
Firstly science has its basis in values not the other way round
You keep saying that I do not think it means what you think it
means
Perhaps you should explain what you think science has it's basis
in values means The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy

So you better explain what objective atoms are and how we get them
from subjective values before we go any further
See above

Did I either ask or assert that  Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again

  Stephen said you took a quote out of context
  You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other trm article
     call it A that took a quote out of context
  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the
     lack of X  a common creationist error
  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the
     conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A
  You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK
     or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite  
  Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned
     taking quotes out of context in A
  I assumed you were being logical and that the sentence that begins
     Could you please explain  was not a nonsequitur but was intended
     to follow from the sentence that preceded it
  Therefore I concluded that you believed that  implied that Stephen
     condoned taking quotes out of context in A
  But we've already seen that  does not imply this
 Therefore you were incorrect to believe that  implied that Stephen
     thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A and were 
     making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists

Is that better Jim   It's called an argument  If you disagree with it
explain why the argument is not sound  I admit that my assumption in 
may have been a bit hasty  If you agree with it just say yup

dj
Yup  Jim's emailed response when I pointed out in a posted article
that one of his arguments was a straw man argument reminiscent of a
frequent creationist ploy

 we can't we can never prove that violation of the Sabbath is not a sin
 any longer  Nor can we prove that violation of Sunday is a sin  We
 cannot use the Sabbath commandment for that purpose

My online Bible is on a CD but I don't own a CDROM system for the
time being so I can't search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly
states that he didn't want to break existing Jewish laws In other
words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday
as their holy day if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus

Cheers
Kent

This deserves framing  It really does  Atoms aren't even real

Tell me then those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are
atoms now so what are they  Figments of our imaginations  The
evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming but I won't bother with
most evidence at the moment

Just to follow up on Casper's posting I have been following this business
since it started  days ago  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt
Carmel location for some years and their neighbors you know the people
next door have said to a man that the BD folks were quiet and never
bothered anybody

There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within the
movement but how does this bring in the Feds In particular what interest
would ATF have in child abuse OK It was the allegation of possesing
illegal automatic weapons  A search warrant could have been obtained
properly only on probable cause This means that some evidence that an
illegal auto weapon was shipped in or an illegal kit for converting
semiauto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped

In either case how does this require an NOKNOCK warrent with a bunch of
macho hot dog assholes busting into the place without identifying
themselves Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway It is no
surprise they shot when invaded Hell I am not a religious extremist and I
might have done the same myself If the DEA busted into my house by
mistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand I would
shoot first and wonder later

So if it was illegal guns the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant
how can you flush a  calibre machine gun down the toilet and
presented it in a peaceful normal way David Koresh has had brushes with
the law even standing trial for attempted murder in which he was
acquitted In every prior brush with the law Koresh and his people acted
peacibly There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks to
indicate that they were any danger to society

NOTE The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists or
slight daft is totally irrelevant It is not against the law to be
looney or zany

Look and learn folks And be VERY afraid

     You say that

There are about  competing Rosicrucian orders existing today
                      
most of them are spinoffs from OTO and other competing organizations
from the th century FranceGermany Maybe I should write an article
                        Please don't  
about all this I spent some time investigating these organizations
and their conceptual world view systems

     Name just three really competing Rosicrucian Orders I have
probably spent more time than you doing the same 

     None of them are spinoffs from OTO The opposite may be the
case

 Just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing You refer to
 differing interpretations of create and say that many Christians may
 not agree So what That is really irrelevant We do not base our faith
 on how many people think one way or another do we The bottom line is
 truth regardless of popularity of opinions

It may be irrelevant to you and your personal beliefs or should I say
bias but it is relevant to me and many others  You're right the
bottom line IS truth independant from you or anyone else  Since you
proclaim truths as a selfproclaimed appointee may I ask you by what
authority you do this  Because it says so in the Bible  Does the
Bible say so or is it YOU or someone else who interprets whether a
scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapproval

Excuse moi but your line of truths haven't moved me one bit to persuade
me that my beliefs are erroneous  Of all the preachers of truth on
this net you have struck me as a selfrighteous member of the wrecking
crew with no positive message to me or other latterday saints whatsoever
BTW this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus
to the pharisees ye hypocrites    ye preach about me with your lips
but your hearts are far removed from me

 Also I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
 and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the Mormon
 belief You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
 have been addressed In order to reply to the issue you have to address
 and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the
 conclusion that you grant

Sophistry  Look who's talking jumping to conclusions  You wouldn't do
that yourself right  All YOU address is your own convictions regardless
whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points
of view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
whatsoever


 The Bible states that Lucifer was created  The Bible states that Jesus
 is the creator of all The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
 belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same

A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation
of lds doctrine  The former KGB would have loved to employ you
Jesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know it



 The Mormon belief is that all are children of God Literally There is
 nothing symbolic about it This however contradicts what the Bible
 says The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God

Correction it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says  The Bible
indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they
belong to or follow God in His footsteps  Satan and his followers have
rebelled against God and are not children followersredeemed of God
but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God but chose to
separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of
salvation


        The field is the world the good seed are the children of the
        kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one
        Matthew 

So  This illustrates nicely what I just said the children of the
kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus
and have shown works of repentance etc and the children of the
wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb  The issue
of satan's spiritoffspring and those who followed him has not been
addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible  You
purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non
related scriptures

lots of nice scriptures deleted NOT Robert W copyrighted though

ra  We are told that And this is life eternal that they might know
ra  thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent
ra  John  Life eternal is to know the only true God Yet the
ra  doctrines of the LDS that I have mentioned portray a vastly
ra  different Jesus a Jesus that cannot be reconciled with the Jesus of
ra  the Bible They are so far removed from each other that to proclaim

Correction my Jesus is indeed different than your Jesus and CAN be
reconciled with the Jesus in the Bible  Not your interpretation of Him
I concur but I honestly couldn't care less

ra  one as being true denies the other from being true According to the
ra  Bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true God and
ra  not the construct of imagination

In this single posting of yours I've seen more constructs of imagination
than in all of the prolds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group  First get your ldsfacts straight before you dare preaching to us
about the only true God whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself  I guess your grandiose selfimage does not allow for other
faiths believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ but in a different
way or fashion than your own  Not that it really matters the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited
every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear

  This is really a red herring It doesn't address any issue raised but
  rather it seeks to obfuscate The fact that some groups try to read
  something into the Bible doesn't change what the Bible teaches

Sigh  What the Bible teaches  Or what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co  I respect the former I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus  On the contrary  And by
the way I do respect your interpretations of the Bible I even grant you
being a Christian following your own image of Him as much as I am a
Christian following my own image of Him in my heart



  Most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of
  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine' I don't
  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon That is not the
  issue  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
  subject is the real issue The indication from Rick is that they may
  certainly be

The issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis
represent or ridicule the lds church  The issue of official doctrine
is obviously very important  McConkie's views have been controversial
eg The Seven Deadly Heresies has made me a heretic   at best
or erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations his book Mormon Doctrine is oftentimes referred to
as McConkie's Bible in mormon circles on mormon doctrine  I rather
look to official doctrinal sources and to Hugh Nibley's books
The last comment is an ldsinsider reference  Summarizing McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation  But having said this I find McConkie even in his most
biased and speculative moments far more thoughtprovoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting

How does one falsify any origin theory For example are a forever existing
universe or abiogenesis strictly falsifiable

The same way that any theory is proven false  You examine the predicitions
that the theory makes and try to observe them  If you don't or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen then you have some 
evidence against the theory  If the theory can't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations then you say that it is false

For example people used to believe that the earth had been created
 years ago  But as evidence showed that predictions from this 
theory were not true it was abandoned

 From article qcqfrfidoasdsgicom by liveseysolntzewpdsgicom 
 Jon Livesey
  If there is a Western ethic against infanticide why
  are so many children dying all over the world
 
 The majority of the world isn't Western

Superficially a good answer but it isn't that simple  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner  For instance some thirdworld countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce  so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US to make tender juicy steaks and burgers  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out  Fundraising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea instead we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World we couldn't give a shit  And that goes for the
supposed ProLife movement too  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion  Hell if they're only interested in fetuses they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China

And besides Suzanne's answer implies that nonWestern countries lack this
ethic against infanticide  Apart from China with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet I don't believe this to be the case

Precisely

There's no objective medicine some people get marvellous results from
alternative therapy others only respond to traditional medicine

There's no objective physics Einstein and Bohr have told us that

There's no objective reality  LSD should be sufficient to prove that

 One wonders just what people who ask such questions understand by the term 
 objective if anything

I consider it to be a useful fiction an abstract ideal we can strive
towards  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string it doesn't
actually exist but we can talk about things as if they were like it and not

Well there are two approaches we can take here  One is to ask you what this
objective morality is assuming it's not a secret

The other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism so that we
can correct your misconceptions

Actually they generally claim that b their particular interpretation of
scripturerevelation is this objective morality  That there are two
conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective

 This brings up another question I still have to ponder  why is there so 
 much antiSemitism  Why do people hate Jews  I don't hate Jews  I consider
 them to be like anyone else sinners we all are
I don't know I don't care about ethnical rights and wrongs myself
but it's evident that Christians consider Jews no longer to be the 
sole selected group of God's people  while Jews consider this to
be the case

Christian antiSemitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should
know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else yet they did not
convert to Christianity en mass thus rejecting Christian Love

No wonder this caused antiSemitism One might even
wonder that if Christianity didn't do this separation would antiSemitism
have even started

I don't see why not Where are the rest of the tribal people What
happened to the tribes of the Americas Culture is seen as different and
undesirable in the West particular in the US with its failed melting
pot concept Most tribes have been hunted to extinction the Hebrew
tribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic Of course it
becomes difficult at times to separate Christianity from the Western
experience so perhaps you are right perhaps it would have been a better 
world if the cultural experiment in Christianity never happened

Rhoemer was the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniforms 
and props used by the early Nazis in their rallies and such

The name is Roehm not Rhoemer  And Hitler does claim that he came up
with the Swastika business

But didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member  some dentist or
other I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf

He was killed in an early Nazi purge He and many of his associates
were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant orgies

I have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this
common assertion recently  Postings to such groups as sochistory and
socculturegerman has not uncovered any netexperts who could provide
any 

Well I'm no expert but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this They
make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the
long knives The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of
the SA was common knowledge Also a book by a homosexual author whose name
escapes me at the moment called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehm
and Heines were homosexuals as well as others in Roehm's SA circle

     Wrong NYC subway breath  Criminals are going to have guns regardless
of what legislative remedy you come up with  However it is the lawabiding
citizens who suffer when guns are harder to obtain  Case in point Washington
DC is the murder capital of the US but has banned handguns and has some
of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation

Overlooking entirely that there is nothing to prevent anyone from
taking the bus across the river to buy guns  An utterly worthless
statistic

  In the UK I read recently that some young women
have been killing even without guns which are nearly impossible to obtain
there and it is a cause of great concern to the Brits

As it should be  They have a homicide rate that is a couple of orders
of magnitude lower then this country's as does almost everyone else
in the world  But I suppose that it's too unreasonable to suppose
that a lower availability of handguns has anything to do with that fact

  Wellarmed citizens
mean that this country will never fear from the government criminals or
invasion

Right  Remember those riots a while back  Remember what they were
about  Nope we have nothing to fear from the US government unlike
those Canadians living under the terribly oppressive regime up north

Why should we want to compare our society which is extremely heterogeneous and
wealthy to one that is basically homogeneous and in dire straits

Britain basically homogeneous  In comparison to the US
Now I know you're an ignorant putz

You can worship every day of the week  The issue is not whether
Christians are at fault for going to church on Sunday or for not going to
church on Saturday  Attending a church service does not mean you have
recognized the holiness of that day my apologies to  Paul Hudson  The
question is On what authority do we proclaim that the requirements of the
              
fourth commandment are no longer relevant to modern Christians  Please

note that the commandment does not command you to go to church only to
keep it holy unto the Lord by refraining from doing on it what only serves
to give you pleasure and satisfaction

When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question 

In paraphrase 

On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they
are above the Law and above the Prophets  major and  minor and not 
accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion 
in Matthew  What is the source of this pseudodoctrine Who is

My online Bible is on a CD but I don't own a CDROM system for the

mucho deleteo concerning abortion not being a choice if lower class women
can't afford it 

     If all choices should have federal funding so poor people can afford them
then shouldn't firearms be federally subsidized  After all it is the people
in the ghettoes who are most affected by the proliferation of weapons among
criminals  Shouldn't they have federal funding so they can protect themselves
and their families from inner city criminals 

Hmmm give everyone a gun free  What a thought  Let's see where it would
lead  I have a gun I don't like your attitude I shoot you  Your friends
have guns they don't like me shooting your they shoot me  My friends have
guns they don't like your friends shooting me they shoot them    Does
this sound like a good thing  Sounds like it would set society back over a
hundred years

Rob

     C'mon Rob  If there is one argument that is ridiculous concerning
abortion it is that prochoice should imply federal funding for abortion 
It's very dishonest

Funding abortion for those women who can't afford it would save the
government money not cost it  The cost of delivery is much higher
and those women can't afford that either  Funding guns as you suggest
as an analogy would cost the government money and would lead to
effective anarchy  See the difference  Somehow I doubt you can

The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the
northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't
give enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared
to say the phototropism of vegetation  A much more likely explanation
is the classic one that the clockwise swastika is the Sunwheel because
the sun progresses across the sky that way  Although that's not the
historical way it happened clocks were first made as little imitation
images of the sun moving thru the heavens  So it's more valid to talk of
the clock going sunwise but do the engineers listen to me  Of course
not  Anyway there is still much uncertainty about whether the
antiswastika goes countersunwise because that represents Evil or
because it is the Sun's twinopposite the Moonwheel  The use of antiSun
to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visuallyoriented
but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now

The trouble with trying to find out the truth is that Roehm and his
buddies were ACCUSED OF being flaming faggots one of the pretexts for the
Night of Long Knives in which Roehm and most of the SA wing of the NSDAP
were purged  Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records
anything bearing on the subject  true or not  has to be considered
tainted evidence  The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law Honestly
The word of Sin is Restriction Would I kid you


Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands
of individuals  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the
Order  Taken out of context words can be interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines of
their original expression

I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta Frater Superior 
of the Order to which I belong  When he included that bit
from Merlinus X' he did us all a service  He showed us the extremes
to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor
I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background but surely
he was an unusual man and he was an important force in the Order 
for many years

Yet as people change so do Orders change and while we look back
so carefully at the dirty laundry of OTO remember that this is
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one individual  I hope to show that there
was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order
itself perhaps by testing the limits myself


Let us examine this issue a bit more closely

In  Karl Kellner  a wealthy Austrian industrialist
and paper chemist as well as a highgrade Mason founded the Ordo
Templi Orientis  Kellner had traveled widely in the East where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices  
Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz
Hartmann Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss who had worked together
prior to joining the OTO  The Order was first proclaimed in 
in Reuss's Masonic publication 'Oriflamme'  On Kellner's death
Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head OHO  The 'Jubilee' edition of
the 'Oriflamme' published in  announced that the Order taught
secret of sexual magic
 
Theodore Reuss was an interesting character  Born June   in
Augsburg he entered Masonry in   He was a singer journalist and
possibly a spy for the Prussian political police infiltrating the Socialist
League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband  Reuss was
later associated with William Wynn Westcott a leader of the Golden
Dawn who later introduced him to John Yarker  Yarker chartered Reuss to
found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany  After several
attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites Reuss settled on the
development of the OTO

The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership
For example he chartered Papus in France Rudolph Steiner in Berlin
and H Spencer Lewis in the USA  In  the historic meeting between
Reuss and Crowley occurred  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing Order secrets  When Crowley looked at it afresh
the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all
the English speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the Equinox

Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in  after suffering a
stroke and named Crowley his successor  All was well until  when
The Book of the Law was translated into German  There was a break
in the continuity of the Order  Manyk members split with the new OHO
over the book which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order
He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request deeply
infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation

An Introduction to the History of the OTO by Ad Veritatem IX'

Within Equinox III Edited by 
  Hymenaeus Beta Frater Superior Rex Summus Sanctissimus
    Caliph of the United States of America
      Published by Samuel Weiser 



There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this
material in Equinox III  And this is the real point is it not
Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of Thelema  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers  A picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations

It is quite easy for me to see for example that all of OTO derived
out of the dribble of faltering Masonry purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them  And I
can take that all the way down to our present Caliph whose feeble
support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best

Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way  
Will I  
I think not
Why  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective an interjection
I am using as an example  My illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first

So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'  Please look OTO more carefully
I do not support Reuss's words myself as I am not qualified to assess
them and I am critical of their pomposity  If I who am a member of
the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then
what can this say about the health of the Order  Does it mean that
the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles  Or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement  How shall we resolve these two possibilities


I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis
They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information  They are quite often artists and geniuses  
Having met some  longstanding members in the SF Bay Area many who are or
were very heavily involved with the Order I can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands

I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta  In these moments 
I followed my intuition and I've found little to stop me from requesting
a Second initiation from a different OTO body  I'm happily participating
in social groups Feasts or Initiations and have come to know the Gnostic
Mass well enough for my tastes
 

This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations however
I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my
limited contact with other members

I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far  There are many
ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with
the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision

I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response
to other posts in this thread


Invoke me under my stars  Love is the law love under will

I am I

  Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
  to questions of science  
 
 it  Did Jesus exist by G A Wells
 
      There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
      based on more than science alone  
 
 Nope no fallacy  Yep science is best in determining how religions handle
 why and who

        The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
        supernatural in the question of origins  Is this is a fair premise

Not entirely  Its not a premise its a conclusion  Second that scientists
for the most part exlude the possibility is not a problem its a necessity 
Scientists are empircists not theologians

        I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
        truth

So do scientists and long before you did  Clearly you have a deep and 
fundamental misunderstanding of science

 
      If you met a man who could walk on
      water raise people from the dead claimed to be the Son of God and
      then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect
      your belief in the origin of man  I can expand on this  
 
 Nope wouldn't affect my knowledge not belief of origins of anatomically
 modern humans  If that man could show me something better I'd change even if 
 it was the biblical story in exact detail  But then I would ask Why in the
 world did your father endow us with intellect and reason and then proceed to
 fool us  I mean the bible says nothing about the humanlike creatures that we
 know exist

        Some of these socalled humanlike creatures were apes  Some were
        humans  Some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments

Absolutely and utterly false except for some were AMHs Lucy Australopithecus
afarensis ca  to  mya is  complete and about  taking into 
consideration bilateral symmetry  Lucy walked upright and bipedally just 
like humans and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern  Her
cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes  There are hundreds of 
other specimens of this and other species of which only some are partially 
reconstructed  They exist Bill  You can touch them feel them hold them  
But forget hominids  The earth the universe the cultural record all look and 
test out as ancient indeed  They are not reconstructions  Has God has tricked
us here too  It won't go away Bill
  


 
 I doubt any of us will meet a man like this  But Bill if your version of all
 this is absolutely correct I'm still no worried about my salvation  I'll
 probaby make it I don't steal murder covet etc and I like to help other
 people  All I did was use the reason and intellect your god provided 
 He or she  benevolent and loving  will understand my dilemma don't you
 think 
           Good deeds do not justify a person in God's sight
           An atonement Jesus is needed to atone for sin

So you and other fundamentalists say  What about the billions who don't 
say so  Beware of people who say they have the truth Bill and reconsider
each time you think you do

 
   Science and
   the Bible are not in contradiction  God can supercede the scientific
   laws as man understands them  Creation is a good example  God has the
   power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos
 
 Haven't been on to long but I have a feeling Bill that the veterans will
 agree with you here  No contradiciton and god can do anything at will  So
 what's the beef or more properly where's

     My point God is the creator  Look's like we agree

That was not your point Bill  Your point above was God has the power 
Scientists generally agree with that  That's a far cry from saying God did
Please attempt to understand your own posts
 
 
     If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the 
     substance of the book it must be a real laugher  Of course Jesus existed
     and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  I can give many if you
     are interested
 
 Its not a laugher Bill  Its a scholarly book that many happen to disagree
 with  I am definitely and seriously interested in confirmation  I know of
 the bible inferences therefrom eg prophecies apocrypha the Koran and
 others  What I am interested is independent evidence  Do you have any  I
 know of Josephus but this is almost certainly an insertion  Also I know of a
 few Roman documents eg Pliny but these deal only with early Christians
 Do you have any independent evidence  I am most interested  Please Email or 
 post  Thanks and best regards

     I'll send you some info via email
     Regards Bill

I have your info and I have replied  several days ago  Hope you have it  
Somehow your post above appeared at my server only today

  Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied
  only to God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We
  are living in the age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable
  by death  There is repentance and there is salvation through our
  Lord Jesus Christ  And not just for a few chosen people  Salvation
  is available to everyone Jew and Gentile alike 
 
 Jews won't agree with you Malcolm
 
 Which Jews KS 
 
Most religious Jews with the exception of the Messianic ones and 
atheistsagnostics Malcolm

KS I see you're wanting Malcolm's response Allow me one last inter
jection then please

Distinguishing among the religious Jews you've excepted the Messianic
for obvious reasons Specifically are you saying it's these religious 
Jews who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy 
rather than by faith who won't agree  Orthodox Jews  

As to the aa if I understand your direction the issue remains 
unproven I suspect considering how atheists and agnostics so often 
look to reason Atheist it is reasonable to conclude will not agree
For agnostics a poll seems in order Who knows  Myself I'm not so 
sure the atheists can be counted out 

For the orthodox I wonder how many would follow Moses or Abraham
or David in accepting God's Word Is the particular covenant to which
one adheres more important than God promisimg I reckon for many it
depends on the ongoing dialogue Under these considerations you might 
understand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree

 However one highly biased account as well as possibly internally 
 inconsistent written over  mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic
 devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more 
 objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature 
 was supposed to be doesn't convince me in the slightest especially when many
 of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of 
 guano

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  

Bill I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who in the course of his or her research is willing to let the
chips fall where they may  This excludes literalists who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists  They find what they want to find  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others

Why an insert  Read it  I have a number of times  The passage is glaringly
out of context and Josephus a superb writer had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work  The passage has nothing to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears

Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about
the Josephus insert your proof is meaningless and it should not be repeated
here  What's more even if Josephus happened to be legitimate it would prove
nothing  Scholars speak of the weight of evidence  Far more independent
evidence would be required to validate your claim  Until forthcoming your
belief is based on faith  That's OK but you exceed your rights when you pass
faith off as fact

As for the gospels there are parallels but there are also glaring
inconsistencies and contradictions  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect 
Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate  I suggest you read Gospel 
Fictions by Randel Helms and The Unauthorized Version by Robin Fox for 
Herb Huston no known kinship or familial relationship but we do indeed share 
an evolutionary ancestry

The fact that there are inconsistencies gaps and contradictions does not deny
your position  On the other hand neither do the gospels prove your faith 
Independent evidence is necessary and I know of none which we have already
discussed and so far you have not provided any  Until then its faith 
Moreover you have committed a fundamental error in logic  You have attempted
to prove your claim with that which you want to prove  Its no different than
saying I am right because I say so  

Your logic is full of circles  It reminds me a bit of the  Presbyterian 
General Assembly  The assembly defined five fundamentals this is where
fundamentalist came from of orthodox Protestant Christianity to wit 
Jesus performed miracles  Jesus was born of a virgin  Jesus was bodily
resurrected  Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin and  here is the
clincher   the bible is the inerrant word of God  Presbyterians construe
inerrant broadly as spritually inerrant  Fundamentalists take the
first four as literally true and then validate them with a literally inerrant
bible which contains the first four and which is the only thing known to 
contain the first four  

Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was

Its faith Bill  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else 
Whatever works for you  Just don't foist it on others

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not

OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in any 
important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   DES
does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either

This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which
accepts  bytes and uses the first  to ECB the second 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics

If noone looks at the results or acknowledges their correctness in what
meaningful sense can the chip be said to work Does flibozity exist
By flibozity I mean a particular extremely complex configuration of 
physical phenomena which noone absolutely NOONE cares about in the 
slightest Does it exist Eric

Getting back to the question of whether the DES chip works doesn't work 
mean something like achieving the desiredexpected effect Note the way 
intentionality subtly underlies that definition Even if we take the 
definition as expected instead of desired can you deny that conformance 
to expectations is itself a value of sorts namely the scientific values of 
accuracyofprediction and reproducibilityofresults

The phenomenologist Husserl for one considered Intentionality to be the
primary ontological stuff from which all other ontology was built 
perceptions consciousness thoughts etc Frank is by no means alone in
seeing intentionality or values as he puts it underlying all human
experience even the socalled objective experiences such as 
measurements of the natural world or the output of your DES chip

 Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
 the use of force
 
 With a few provisos yes  Minimum force for a start And it
 depends on what is being forced on either side   
 
 Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
 people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
 that our own actions in doing so are not moral
 
 My opinion is that our actions would be moral and it would be
 immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective  
 Again there many caveats and provisios
 
 Note my usage of my opinion is an admission that I don't have a lock
 on morals not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on

You're admitting a lot more than that  You are admitting that
your morals are situational   You are admitting that the actions
of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions

If you employ X degree of force that's not moral but if you employ
X degree of force but previously someone else has employed Y degree
of force and the situation is thusandso that is moral

This is quite different from saying Employing force on other people
is immoral period   Unfortunately from time to time we are obliged
to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
we have to bear the moral consequences of that

For what it's worth  and yes I know you claim to be an agnostic 
it's this ability to relabel things from immoral to moral 
that I find one of the least attractive qualities of the religious
mind

You're asking us to accept that the deal you offered would be turned

A brutal act of terrorism inspired by Christian propoganda was recently

Kent With all due respect how can I take you seriously when you have
the NAMES wrong in the st place Eg


The San Jose RC Ordo Rosae Crucis 

	There is no such thing The correct name is Ancient  Mystical
Order Rosae Crucis abbreviated AMORC

and the Rocicrusian
order created by Max Heindel

	There is no such thing either It's the Rosicrucian Fellowship
And they clearly state that they DO NOT pretend to descend from the
Order of the Fama Fraternitatis

In addition there are many splinter groups
all around Europe that all claim some connection with the original
group supposedly founded in the middle ages

The Lectorium And who else

Some Freemason groups
also have Rosicrucianlike separate groups even if they are far
from the ideologies the RC groups have somehow in common

These are NOT Rosicrucian orders They are Masonic study groups none
of which claims to be descendant of the original Order


We might compete about how much time we have spent with this  Let
me start I was part of the ORC for about  years
Kent

What is ORC If you mean AMORC you didn't even learn the correct
name

Tony

      Name just three really competing Rosicrucian Orders I have
 probably spent more time than you doing the same 
 
      None of them are spinoffs from OTO The opposite may be the
 case 
 
 Can we assume from this statement that you are unequivocally saying that
 AMORC is not a spin off of OTO  and that in fact OTO may well be a spin
 off of AMORC
 i would be quite interested in hearing what evidence you have to support this
 claim 
 
 

Well there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
that OTO has been around since at least the late s long before
Crowley ever heard of it how long has AMORC been around yes I know
that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory
but I doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
as a nonprofit that can be carbondated to  BC

Absolutely Lewis didn't care for the  OTO charter from Reuss He had
in mind something completely diferent Crowley and Lewis were very

 and that in fact OTO may well be a spin

ON the subject of how many competing RC orders there are let me point out the
Golden Dawn is only the outer order of that tradition  The inner order is
the Roseae Rubeae et Aurae Crucis  That's Ruby Rose and Gold Cross in rough
translation  The G'D' is a Rosicrucian order as are all derivative
groups  Of course real Rosicrucians never admit to being Rosicrucian

Well you know that you're getting somewhere when you start getting
responses like this

Kent let me explain it to you

If you are paying for a phone and you don't want callwaiting YOU DON'T
NEED TO PAY FOR CALlWAITING

This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous because it has exposed a real scam

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

There are basic services and there are optional services Dennis Call 
waiting is an optional service but having the number  work on one's phone
is a basic service Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the 
on his phone since none of the numbers he calls has a  in it doesn't mean 
that he has the right to demand that the phone company unbundle the charges
for the use of each phone digit an unbundling that would be horrendously
inefficient because of all the billing  bookkeeping overhead Similarly 
abortion can be seen as a basic service

Furthermore public funding of abortion SAVES money as well as being in the 
views of a substantial portion of the population probably a clear majority 
an ethical thing to do If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that 
way why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities 
with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion If every prolifer did 
the same it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which 
would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion Then you 
would get your wish And you know what No prochoicer I know would stop
you carrying out that plan They might even HELP you with it

The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW
as will be covered with this treatise

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him SAW
is the last prophet of Islam  He is the Prophet who is revealed
the last Holy Scripture Qur'an by Allah SWA all praise be to Him
through the Arch Angel Gabriel  He is the seal of all prophets
till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah
SWA all praise be to Him  Muhammad SAW lived between
 AC  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW
is a treason against Islam against Qur'an against the message
of Allah SWA  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael another
messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah
He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his
coming  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from 
Chapter  Verse  whose rough translation is as follows

	Muhammad is not the father of any of your men
	but he is the messenger of Allah and the seal
	of the prophets and Allah has full knowledge of
	all things


Commentary on the above verse  When a document is sealed
it is complete and there can be no further addition  The 
Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers
Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous but there
has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW  The later
ages will want thinkers and revivers not Prophets  This is not
an arbitrary matter  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom
for Allah has full knowledge of all things

   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZATI AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW       

continued from Droplet Vol  No  Part 

   SECOND  SIGN   The  Noble  Messenger  SAW
declared His prophethood and presented to humanity a
decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles
which number according to the scholars one thousand
The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet  In
fact as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise
Our'an even they could not deny the occurrence of His
miracles but only called them hasha wa kellaAllah forbids 
sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive their
followers  The miracles of Muhammad SAW have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema scholars
of Islam to the hundreth degree
   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of
the universe of His declaration of Prophethood it has the
effect of the words'You have indeed spoken the truth '
   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler
while being observed by Him 'The true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position  'At a time when
you were asked to prove your claim the word 'Yes'
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you  Or if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word 'Yes'
   In the same way ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger
claimed 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this
universe  My proof is that He will change His unbroken
order at my request and my prayer  Now look at my
fingers  He makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots  Look at the moon by a gesture of my finger He
splits it in two  Look at that tree to affirm me and to bear
witness to me it moves and comes near to me  Look at
this food although it is barely enough for two or three
men it satisfies two or three hundred  'Further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles  However the evidences  of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles  All his
deeds and acts his words and behavior his moral
conduct and manners his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness
Indeed many people  such  as  Abdullah  b Salam  the
famous scholar of the Children of Israel came to belief
merely by seeing him and said 'No lie can hide in this
face nor can any fraud be found in it'
   Although many of the  researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand there are
thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of
his prophethood  And hundreds of thousands of
truthseeking men muhakkikiin with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways
   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness  Since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away then the
prophethood of Muhammad SAW is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others  For
whatever evidences qualities  and attributes  became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as Jesus AS and Moses AS they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by Muhammad SAW  And since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of Muhammad SAW this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets

 However one highly biased account as well as possibly internally 
 inconsistent written over  mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic
 devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more 
 objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature 
 was supposed to be doesn't convince me in the slightest especially when many
 of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of 
 guano

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  
 
Bill I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who in the course of his or her research is willing to let the
chips fall where they may  This excludes literalists who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists  They find what they want to find  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others
 
Why an insert  Read it  I have a number of times  The passage is glaringly
out of context and Josephus a superb writer had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work  The passage has nothing to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears

I think this is a weak argument  The fact is there are two references to
Jesus in Antiquities of the Jews one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians  Origen wrote in the third century that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah while the long passage
says the opposite  There is an Arabic manuscript of Antiquities of the
Jews which contains a version of the passage which is much less gungho
for Jesus and may be authentic
   There is no question that Origen in the third century saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus  There are no manuscripts of Antiquities which
lack the references

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted but
I don't think it's very likelynor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case I know GA Wells takes
this position but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed  And he is a professor of German not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus

Question  Is there any effective difference between

Objective values exist and there is disagreement over what they are

and

Values are subjective

I don't see any

The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values
The second means that values are a reference to some preference of the
individual  In the first case it is possible that some future discovery
might invalidate certain views re what objective values are

The trouble with trying to find out the truth is that Roehm and his
buddies were ACCUSED OF being flaming faggots one of the pretexts for the
Night of Long Knives in which Roehm and most of the SA wing of the NSDAP
were purged 

Stop Hold it You have a few problems here Official history says that 
the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi 
party long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power So this objection is a red
herring even if established history is wrong on this point Moreover none of 
the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using 
homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm A point I saw reiterated was that
Hitler and the party covered up these accusations If you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication you should at least get your facts
right The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in
a coup against Hitler Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge nor as a justification afterwards it
is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this but I doubt
it  would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual 

Anyway as I said before it is always possible that I have missed references 
to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the 
night of the long knives  but this does not prove that they were false Even 
the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage In any case 
this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 
's

Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records
anything bearing on the subject  true or not  has to be considered
tainted evidence 

Ah yes I forgot this was being posted to altconspiracy I can smell the
paranoia from here Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with 
homosexuality at least not according to what I've read I'd like to know 
what tainted evidence you are talking about Since the accusations were made 
by persons outside of the Nazi party long before it came to power and those 
accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 
's and 's just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in 
time and plant tainted evidence How exactly does one doctor newspapers 
which were circulated around the world without the discrepancies being 
obvious What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about And what about the testimony of people who were involved in 
these matters some of whom were not Nazis And what is the point of making a 
false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it Since the point 
here seems to be to discredit established history then the burden of proof 
falls on the revisionist The revisionists had better do their homework 
before making accusations Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts

The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd
the SA  Sturmabteilung Storm Troopers  left the world a better
place when they departed 

This is just about the only thing we agree on 

I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people  Roehm and 
his SA buddies  who were homosexuals must disturb some people The feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals This fear  often justified  is what
lies behind this distrust of official history or so it seems to me But this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject If 
you really think that historians are so incompetent why don't you write them 
and ask where they got their sources on this subject if you can't tell from 
their footnotes I'm a graduate student in history Writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat But my time is limited and this is not my
specialty  and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence I'm not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone's paranoia Do the research yourself

but concrete particulars are still no more than
more or less shrewd guesses  
 Diccon Frankborn

Given that you already consider all evidence tainted what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars And since when have concrete particulars been
considered shrewd guesses

I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians Irving et al 
historians writing for a popular audience do not as a rule provide copious 
footnotes  should try instead reading academic historians who usually 
provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail This is the place 
to start looking Assuming that one really wants to know the truth

I'll bet the folks on altpagan are tired of this subject already My
apologies  we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent I forget which gods
are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject
boundaries

sandviknewtonapplecom Kent Sandvik writes

My online Bible is on a CD but I don't own a CDROM system for the
time being so I can't search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly
states that he didn't want to break existing Jewish laws In other
words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday
as their holy day if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus

I think the passage you're looking for is the following

Matthew     Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the 
prophets I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them 
Matthew    For truly I say to you till heaven and earth pass away 
not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished 
Matthew    Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments 
and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he 
who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of 
heaven 
Matthew    For I tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of 
the scribes and Pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven 

There are several problems with this  The most serious is that the
Law was regarded by Jews at the time and now as binding on Jews but
not on Gentiles  There are rules that were binding on all human
beings the socalled Noachic laws but they are quite minimal  The
issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do
about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ  The decision not to
impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished  It
simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles  This
is a simple answer which I think just about everyone can agree to
A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded
in Acts 

However there's more involved  In order to get a full picture of the
role of the Law we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent
rejection of the Law and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of
the Law  At least as I read Paul he says that the Law serves a
purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded  Again this
issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law  In the middle of his
discussion Paul notes that he might be understood this way and
assures us that that's not what he intends to say  Rather he sees
the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their
sinfulness  But ultimately it's an impossible standard and one that
has been superceded by Christ  Paul's comments are not the world's
clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading  But the
interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does
not entail an abolition of the Law  It still remains as an
uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed
For its purpose of convicting of sin it's important that it not be
relaxed  However for Christians it's not the end  ultimately we
live in faith not Law

While the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the
end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion  The
quoted passage from Mat  should be taken in the context of the rest
of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus shows us how he interprets the
Law  The not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading
but in fact that's not Jesus' approach  Jesus' interpretations
emphasize the intent of the Law and stay away from the ceremonial
details  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
towards the Sabbath and kosher laws  Some scholars claim that Mat
 needs to be taken in the context of st Cent Jewish
discussions  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that
really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and
plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full of extortion and rapacity  Mat  This and
the discussion later in Mat  suggest that Jesus has a very specific
view of the Law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the
Law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it
Paul's conclusion is similar  While he talks about the Law being
superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the
ceremonial law such as circumcision and the Sabbath  He is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards

The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being
superceded and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained I believe
they are talking about different aspects of the Law  Paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision  As is natural in letters
responding to specific situations he's looking at the aspect of the
Law that is currently causing trouble the Law as specifically Jewish
ceremonies  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
of conduct  On the other hand when Jesus commends the Law he seems
to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give Paul so much trouble

It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but
we should be familiar with that from current conflicts  Look at the
way terms like family values take on special meaning from the
current context  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to
figure out why family values should be used as a code word for
opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the US  I
think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was
involved in  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values
that go along with the term Law any more than people who concerned
about the family values movement are really opposed to family

taiteccwfccutexasedu  writes 
     If all choices should have federal funding so poor people can afford
them
then shouldn't firearms be federally subsidized  After all it is the
people
in the ghettoes who are most affected by the proliferation of weapons among
criminals  Shouldn't they have federal funding so they can protect         s
themselve
and their families from inner city criminals

Criminals mostly  get steal their guns from people who buy them
legally  In order to reduce the number of guns criminals use you'd
need to to reduce and not increse the number of legally held guns

     Wrong NYC subway breath  Criminals are going to have guns regardless
of what legislative remedy you come up with  However it is the lawabiding
citizens who suffer when guns are harder to obtain  Case in point
Washington
DC is the murder capital of the US but has banned handguns and has some
of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation  They ain't working
big brother Ray

They don't work because you need a nationwide confiscation of all guns
Ralphie That's why it dosen't work in DC They didn't confiscate the guns
that all ready exist Therefore what Ray said still applies

 If only we could keep guns
out of criminals hands we would just have a bunch of citizens getting
stabbed
choke and beaten to death

However Ralphie the amount of killings would go down Think about it With
guns it just takes the pull of a trigger Other forms of murder require much
more effort on the part of the murderer





In the UK I read recently that some young women
have been killing even without guns which are nearly impossible to obtain
there and it is a cause of great concern to the Brits  Wellarmed citizens
mean that this country will never fear from the government criminals or
invasion  We may have twice the murder rate of the UK but who gives a flip

You should Although maybe you're right Well armed citizens wouldn't have
to worry about little boys and their threats against women and abortion
clinics

Why should we want to compare our society which is extremely heterogeneous and
wealthy to one that is basically homogeneous and in dire straits

Ralphie ever been to London or any major city in the UK You know not what
you speak And as far as England being in dire straits have you forgotten
your lines about civil wars and society erupting in the US

 What about
Japan  If Americans were willing to give some of the Draconian punishments
that the Japs are perhaps we wouldn't need guns  Or the Germans  They have
a th century history of being extremely reactionary so guns or no guns
those
suckers know how to take care of bih'ness

Do you have a point here Except to explain the crap that follows

     Point is Raymeister that America is violent  And to put up in an OhSo
DarwinianManner the toughest on this planet survive  Not the GoodPeople
tm
but the tough ones  The top  nations in GNP in the world are Japan Germany
and the US  All these countries have a violent tradition  Pure coincidence
I doubt it

Ralphie only you in your sick mind would think that this is the reason Japan
and Germany's GNP are two of the highest Probably had more to do with the
economic rebuilding after World War II I think you need to study the issue
a little more But in Ralphie's World violence is to be worshipped Isn't it

How many times need we point the obvious OUT to you
As LONG as the Patriarchy has been Decimated by 
ModernSeXularHumanism and ITS imposition that only
the STATE is authorized to Wield Capital Punishment
We can NEVER restore WholeSomeGodFearingBibleBelievingTraditionalFamilyValues

Now Just Imagine Father Abraham in the Modern Era

God Comes unto him and demands that he take his son up
to the Hills to be sacrificed unto the Lord

Now Abraham being a devout man leads out his son for a 
sacrifice to God On High and BANG Out Comes the BATF
with Tanks and Air Support to cover the Child Protection Agency
with a Warrent for Abraham's arrest as a Moral Deviant and a 
Child Abuser The BATF Lays SIEGE to Father Abraham's home
for months on END and will NOT LISTEN to the VOICE of GOD

As LONG as ModernSeXularHumanism is allowed to DENY the
God Given Rights of the Patriarchy we CAN NOT be SAFE

I see the point on falsifying God as per the scientific method  A question
I've always wanted to ask is this When scientists say that the second law
does not apply to the earth they say it is because it is not a closed system 
ie there is energy coming in from an outside force  namely the sun  Is 
the universe a closed or open system and how could either be proven If it is
a closed system have you been to the outside to look in  If it is open how 
do you know

I'll yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way
to discuss it  If you're interested in a change here's an idea

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What right do
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality
Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your brother and say that I was 
exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didn't want
anyone forcing their morality on me or I don't follow your morality

ON the subject of how many competing RC orders there are let me point out the
Golden Dawn is only the outer order of that tradition  The inner order is
the Roseae Rubeae et Aurae Crucis  


	Just wondering do you mean the Lectorium Rosicrucianum
Warning There is no point in arguing who's legit and who's not WHICH
Golden Dawn are you talking about

 Which Golden Dawn How about the original from  years ago

	Just for the sake of argument reflecting NO affiliation
I am going to say that the TRUE Rosicrucian Order is the Fraternitas
Rosae Crucis in Quakertown Penn

	Any takers 

 No No Rosicrucian would ever admit or deny being such

 It was interesting to watch the  club today  Pat Robertson said that the
 Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god He
 also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it

I don't necessarily agree with Pat Robertson  Every one will be placed before
the judgement seat eventually and judged on what we have done or failed to do
on this earth  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship
Worship of money is one of the greatest religions in this country

I do agree that it was a terrible tragedy and yes the FBI blew it
 
 However I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
 world had a similarly humble 'cultstatus' beginning even and perhaps
 especially christianity  

Cult status maybe but they didn't have to take up arms to protect themselves
As you may recall the early Christians were pacifists preferring to avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner  Why else
do you think the apostles were thrown into jail so often and beaten up for the
sake of their beliefs

 It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
 Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled  

Selffulfilled  I heard that Koresh was predicting that the FBI would be the
ones to burn  It doesn't take any great insight to light yourself on fire maybe
perverse delusion

 Maybe David
 Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
 new major religion to me
  

NOT  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world for a brief
moment in time  Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the
FBI Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers  Sick and    sad

 Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who
 is next  The Mormons or Jews

Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get
                                 
You are making a ludicrous suggestion

As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

  I don't think it's too far off of the mark either  No one 'deserves' what
they get  Punishment is for the justice system flawed as it may be  This
whole 'well it served the idiots right' mentality is nothing but a revenge
mentality and my opinion is that revenge is for children and the emotionally
retarded Frank Herbert 'Dune' series

Please allow me to explain myself  In  the governor of Missouri
governor Boggs issued his socalled Mormon extermination order  The
only crime illegal activity the Latterday Saints had committed was
their religious affiliation their antislave stance Missouri still
allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in Missouri

  Well every group has a somewhat selective memory of it's past  Even the
protestants who look to Martin Luther for starting the whole movement
conveniently forget his diatribes telling nobles to slaughter the peasants
who rebelled against unjust conditions

I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow
to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience
brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements

  They stood up for what they believed in and the people of the time hated
them for that and because they were different  Xenophobia has always been
one of the strongest reasons for death and destruction

 more about mormon oppression deleted
  when we tried to organize socreligionmormon andor
talkreligionmormon a whole bunch of charitable believers effectively
blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism
et al in an appropriate forum  We really must be a threat to various
establishments

  Anyone who's confident in what they believe should not have a problem
listening to dissenting points of view  It's something called 'free speech'
which radicals usually push aside in favour of doing what's 'right'

  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa
tion also belongs in the category of persecution  It is ironic that those
who oppose us point to all kinds of justifications to do so despite
their claims of adhering to a gospel of love

 Ahh I agree with that most strongly  Who cares about 'claims'  All I
want to see are actions  If you act like you hate me you probably do all
pieinthesky religious affiliations to the contrary

Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government I do but NOT without
questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
resolves

  Yes  Most people don't realize that it's NOT some 'government' sitting
in a faraway magical land that makes decisions it's people  And those
people make mistakes like any human  Questioning the government in everything
it says and does should be one of our most fundamental rights

  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

  Until this all settles I'm not sure anyone can make that sort of blanket
statement  Sure they may have been quiet peaceloving people who just
happened to be armed to the teeth but who knows what David Koresh had planned

Please explain  I do not remember Jews or Mormons as a group overtly
breaking a judicious aka nonNazi law and being punished for it
ReadYourHistory  It HAS happened as explained above in some detail
and will undoubtedly happen again Indeed WHO IS NEXT  Socalled Illegal
activities can be twisted and bend to suit anyone's need including the
agendas of secular authorities

  You don't even have to break laws to get punished as I'm sure many people
have found out  What about the drug laws that permit the police to seize
any suspect goods  And some grandmother travels with  in cash in her
handbag doesn't trust the banks it falls open and the police end up
confiscating it  This is not an isolated case either

  Or laws to stop companies from making lookalike FordGM car parts and
selling them as the real thing  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 's cars

  All I'm saying is that it should NOT be assumed that someone is inherently
eviletc when the government decides to nail them

  It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in
everything for them who are really dangerous

So if it was illegal guns the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant

In addition it is ridiculous for this Hicks guy from the FBI saying that
they were just trying to bring them before the bar to face justice when
who should really be on trial is every officer involved in the brainless
BATF assault  Granted it would be tough to convict when the bodies were

It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
average people and that at the time almost all Americans were pretty
homogeonously Christian  It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust
at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred

The situation is not entirely different today  Many irrational feelings and
beliefs are justified through religion  I don't think most of them are started
because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate
prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages
critical thought

In any regard Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from
being trusted or righteous  Have things really changed for the better  I
may be a born cynic but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case In the early s I believe the late President Kimball lds church
leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MXPeace Keeper
missile maze from being built in Utah yet another inspired decision from
secular authorities  Fortunately his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off

Do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of
people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassingeradicating the
Mormons  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
nuclear testing etc was to get them thar Mormons  And what about the
majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons  You seem to be searching for enemy
conspiracies  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly
must have been done primarily for that purpose

  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with
John I too wonder who or what's next

I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
life of even one person  Sure he did not pose a threat to the security of
this nation  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers  That
much is definite

Who killed who  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound
What REALLY caused the murder of the little children  Could it be that
the ATFFBI presence has any bearing upon the events  How would you
interpret the Mt Masada events  Blame the Jews  What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway  What business did the ATFFBI has in Waco
Texas  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
team in   In that case the police botched the job as well  But to
lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake
I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case  Certainly if David
Koresh chose any peaceful option the ATF and FBI would have complied  The
responsibility is more his than the authorities

David Koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the
executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers

Characterizing the ATFFBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair  In order
to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent to kill

A short comment
As you may recall the early Christians were pacifists preferring to
avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner

The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city
Despite some pious legends the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
especially after centuries of political instability and terror the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology Acts is eerily familiar especially today

 I recall reading in Michael  Rutherford's novel Sarum a scene in
 which the son of a Roman nobleman living in Britain takes part in a
 secret ceremony involving a bull  He stands naked in a pit covered
 with some sort of scaffolding while assistants coax a bull to stand on
 the scaffolding  They then fatally stab the bull which douses the
 worshipper in the pit with blood  This is supposedly some sort of
 rite of passage for members of the bull cult  I wonder if this is
 related to the Mithras cult

Yes this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic
cult although not the only one  It had many elements that seem
to have been borrowed by Catholicism eg the Mass communion the
sharing of a sacred meal consecration of bread and wine etc

For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea check out

The Covenant of the Flame
by David Morrell

It has some quite interesting occult bits and lots of killing
I won't spoil it by revealing the ending but I will say that it
is relevant to Mithraism

 All the liberals on this newsgroup that think morality should not be
 legislated need to stuff it I'll take morality over the drug plague
 the AIDS plague the kids shooting kids in school the pedophilers the
 explosion in child abuse that is happening now etcetera etcetera 
 those things are tangible All that liberal feelgood bs about We
 can't legislate morality because well well just because needs
 to find the fastest route back to its homeland RUSSIA and Marxism

	Hmmmlet's see here  the drugs in question are illegal
kids shooting kids actually people shooting people is illegal 
sex with children is illegal child abuse is illegal etcetera etcetera
Yep it sure looks like the legislation of your morality is working like
a charm

 Uh people have killed in the name of God too though this century
 has proven that no Holy war can quite match the bloodlust of
 antireligious Marxism Examples The USSR  million adult born
 people killed various political purges etc China xx million killed
 since Mao Tsu Tung first painted their land Red and for China they're
 still killing the list goes on All these countries banned religion
 and promised their people a Utopia when they were freed from God But
 that still doesn't erase the fact that they took their title of
 TheWorld'sMostBloodthirsyInstitution out of the hands of none other than
 the religious faithful who had held it for  years before that
 Hell even Hitler couldn't top what Stalin did in Russia but until
 recently no one has been willing to discuss that much so by default
 Hitler remains the model dictator and villain when in fact Stalin was
 much his superior in that awful deplorable sense

	So religion and totalitarianism seem to be kissin' cousins
I'll pass on both thank you kindly

 
 The use of God does NOT NECESSARILY MEAN the killing will stop Please
 consider that

	The use of Gawd seems to encourage killing  
 
 
I want the phrase under God removed from our pledge also  God
doesn't deserve that insult
 
 Oh yeah and you better stop using money because In God We Trust can

Tony

I read your post it was nothing new I had seen much the same in other
typicalChristian antigay sentimental literature  Gay people are and will
con tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates  You may
be unaware of all the statistica findings concerning AfricanAmericans that
have been published and used by various groups to reenforce their own bias
against AfricanAmericans  We usually think of the KKK in these instances
but there are many other groups  Of course the vast majority of the public
scoff at such findings and documents today but that was not always the case
Fortunately AfricanAmericans had whites who supported their 'cause' and
public sentiment was eventually if not entirely turned around  There was
even a Civil War and antinegro sentiment increased  In fact until laws
were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty
much legal to discriminate against them

I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination  You may think that I have been deceived or something
that is your perogative  My church Christian Church Disciples of Christ
openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society
including gays  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation
and making disciples  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love
and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed even if it is not popular
to do so  I really like my church for last reason the most  I can find a
church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes
in the commandment of Love though I'm hardpressed to find many who actually
sho Love but not many are willing to champion the oppressed especially
within their own community  I may have lost face with the greater Christian
community for the unpopularity of my beliefs but so did the abolitionists
against the oppression of AfricanAmericans  Many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being niggerlovers and such  I guess I've
decided the challenge is worth it

In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed marriages wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt in the process etc  Funny thing is I don't know of one
case where the parents exwives or even children have continued to reject
their gay family member son daughter exhusband father etc after they
began to take part in some form of support group like PFLAG

I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado and am equally out
raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon from the Tradition Values
Coalition have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner
support within several  I believe states this coming November for more
oppressive legisation against gays

Perhaps you don't get it and maybe you never will  Many didn't get it in the
Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands
in witch hunts and inquisitions

The message that comes through loud and clear by proponents against gay
rights and against gays in general is that there is a strong dislike even
hatred for gays whether you want to call it such or not it doesn't change
the results  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the
final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr Hudson is that YOU have a
conditional love for gays  Condition  Change and we'll love you This is
sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an unconditional
love one that calls people just as they are  Sure there are things that
will 'naturally' change and habits like alcoholism wife beating etc that
need to be changed through some sort of therapy  But then there are things
like lefthandedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people is
going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other
people's expectations In the process this coerced conformity causes many
people a great deal of harm especially when it is caused by people who have
nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their
own sense of pseuperspirituality

This is sad but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change  It may be
unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with
something very personal like 'sexuality' a taboo subject even today but I
firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation
on thier bedrooms  It's funny that most straight people have successfully
removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation
but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repressionas though it
helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society
Gay people are not criminals

Another interesting thing happened recently  A very prominent charismatic
church in the Silicon Valley here had two of it's pastors arrested for self
admitted charges of pederasty men having sex with boys  This had apparently
been going on for some time a couple years but since the charges were
voluntary and the church worked closely with the police so I imagine that
was how they managed to downplay it in the media  How could such a thing
happen when the church itself has an exgay ministry  One of my friends
recently told me he was approached by someone who is going through the
reparitive therapy there and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry

These are difficult times we live in but providing hostile environments and
creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not
the call of the Christian community  The results of the passing amendment in
Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over
Colorado called STRAIGHT I forget the whole definition off hand
but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash and their motto
is Working for a fagfree America with an implicit advocation for violence

This is sick and it seems to be what you and Mr Hudson and others are
embracing

We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don't 'measure up' and constant beratement from
organizations like The Christian Research Institute while they do have a good
purpose also their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of
excluding people

The Gospel I believe is not so negative rather it seeks ways to include
people  I have several of Dr Martin's books and find them quite helpful
especially concerning 'cults' But it seems that CRI has become a cult unto
itself  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people
to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away

Whatever

Plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say values are
relative   Accuracy is a value judgement too  It so happens I agree with 
the substance of what you say below but it's clear to me that at least 
some values are objective  Truth is better than falsehood peace is
better than war education is better than ignorance  We know these things
if we know anything

Assuming for the moment that morals are relative then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results

No they cannot because they acknowledge up front that THE desired
results do not exist  That after all is the meaning of compromise

Plus some problems If the relativists have no values in common compromise 
is impossible  what happens then    Who if anyone is right  What happens 
if one relativist has a value Never compromise  A value plant bombs in 
crowded shopping areas  After all if morals are relative these values 
cannot meaningfully be said to be incorrect

Assuming that there is an absolute morality two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there
is no room for compromise  Once you beleive in absolute morals
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral

Untrue  One can accept that one does not know the whole truth  Part
of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility is
better than rigidity compromise is better than believing you have a lock
on morals etc  In the same way I can believe in an objective reality
without claiming to know the mechanism for quantum collapse or who shot
JFK

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
I'd say that compromise seems to be better

And I would agree   But it's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it's
merely a matter of taste  Is your liking for peace any better founded
than someone else's liking for icecream  I'm looking for a way to say
yes to that question and relativism isn't it

I think that you are changing the meaning of values here Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word

value n  A fair equivalent or return for something such as goods
or service  Monetary or material worth  Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance merit  A principle standard or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable  Precise meaning as
of a word  An assigned or calculated numerical quantity  Mus 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest  The relative darkness or
lightness of a color  The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound 

In context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best In terms
of scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing

No I'm using definition  or perhaps  in both cases  If there
is no objective worth usefulness or importance then science has no 
objective worth usefulness or importance  If nothing is inherently
worthwhile or desirable then simple theories with accurate predictions
are not inherently worthwhile or desirable Do you see any flaws in this

If on the other hand some things have objective worth usefulness
or importance it would be interesting to know what they are

If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will
be a good beginning

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful worthy or important in
dealing with observed facts  Alternatively you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful worthy
or important in any situation   In other words I need to know
how you use the term objective

Hmmmm  Define objective morality  Well depends upon who you talk to
Some say it means you can't have your hair over your ears and others say
it means Stryper is acceptable  I would say that general principles
of objective morality would be listed in one or two places

Ten Commandments
Sayings of Jesus

the first depends on whether you trust the Bible 
the second depends on both whether you think Jesus is God and whether
  you think we have accurate copies of the NT
Gong
Take a moment and look at what you just wrote First you defined
an objective morality and then you qualified this objective morality
with subjective justifications Do you see the error in this
Sorry you have just disqualified yourself but please play again

I'm afraid it's much worse than this Jesus said follow the Ten
Commandments AND the Torah And the Prophets Christians on the other
hand are not only above the Ten Commandments AND the Torah AND the
Prophets ie they believe that they do not have to follow it they
don't even follow the subjective morality of Jesus So we see that
Christians can't follow the objective morality of their own Ten
Commandments they can't follow the subjective morality of Jesus when
He said follow the Ten Commandments yet they expect the rest of the
world to do what Is there any logic here Is there any morality here
objective or subjective Is Christianity somebody's idea of a joke Who
could be pulling the wool over the eyes of so many Christians Who could
be such a great deceiver

True enough  OK in the universe we have today which is better a science
that predicts the motion of the planets and it happens so or a science
which predicts that sonic the hedgehog will record an album with Elvis on
a certain date and it doesn't happen  Can the answer to this question
be called objective or is it a matter of opinion

	Yes

	If one's particular goal is to land a man on the moon or to 
put a communication sattelite into a orbit within which it will operate 
then orbital astronomy will be more important

	However if one is a particular fan Sonic's singing or a competator 
of Sonic say Mario and the Toadstools knowing when he will record an ablum 
would be more important

	I fail to see how this is connected in any way nor where you are 
driving too

  Truth is better than falsehood 

	So if you were housing a Jew in your home in Holand  and
the SS troopers asks if you are housing a Jew is it objectively better to
tell the truth  I am holding a Jew  than a falsehood  No I am not
holding a Jew

	In this case let us assume that if you lie the SS trooper leaves
never to bother you Either way nothing is ever done to you no prison 
trouble etc

	Of course if you tell the truth then the Jew will be executed

	Is it better to tell the truth or lie
	




	 In this case I would consider not saying anything to be a lie
Or at the very least it implies that falsehood is on the same level of 
telling the truth Or we can stipulate that the SS have methods to make you 
say something only they can not control whether or not you say yes or
no Only that you will say one or the other 


   Only when the Sun starts to orbit the Earth will I accept the Bible

 Objective morality is morality built from objective values

You now pushed down the defintion of objectivity into realm of
objective values So you need to explain that as well as well
as the objective subparts the objective atoms quarks
Firstly science has its basis in values not the other way round
You keep saying that I do not think it means what you think it
means
Perhaps you should explain what you think science has it's basis
in values means The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy

It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
results  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else  One cannot attach
any objective worth to the results of science  for the simple reason
that one cannot attach objective worth to anything  

However not only are the outputs of science subjectively valued so are
the inputs  More problems  Which facts to observe   What
is a fact  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather
than noise  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I
do  As a loyal relativist I must assume that what's signal for me
may not be signal for you  The objectivity postulate should not sit
well with me

So the relativist attends to a system designed at whim fed with what should 
be assumed to be conflicting data in the expectation of results which need 
satisfy noone  GIGO

So you better explain what objective atoms are and how we get them
from subjective values before we go any further
See above

 Note to readers outside ta    
 
 taite has been advocating violent civil disobedience in the US
 in order to promote his view that abortion should be illegal  Given the
 necessity and the opportunity I would have no objection to forcing 
 morality on him if that's what it would take to prevent him carrying out
 his stated desire to hang women who have multiple abortions 

What do you mean when you say I would have no objection

Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
the use of force

Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
that our own actions in doing so are not moral

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expectsfears one might need
If one is opposed to abortion one should not be required to pay for
coverage of it because one will NEVER want to use that service and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder  

Overriding any concern about morality is the fact that men Dennis
is a man's name don't get abortions  Thus it is unreasonable to 
suppose that YOUR insurance premiums are being used for the 
possibility that you will be getting an abortion

It looks like what you're really objecting to is other people paying
money for the possibility that THEY might need to get an abortion

Well you know that you're getting somewhere when you start getting

Kent let me explain it to you

If you are paying for a phone and you don't want callwaiting YOU DON'T
NEED TO PAY FOR CALlWAITING

This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous because it has exposed a real scam

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder
for reasons of conscience  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all
anymore then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for abortion
coverage if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs  Or are we
going to start forcing Jews to eat pork Quakers to fight in wars etc

No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto loyalty oath in support of
abortion in order to gain access to health care ESPECIALLY if one's
conscience is so obviously against the practice of abortion

 The results of the passing amendment in
 Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over
 Colorado called STRAIGHT I forget the whole definition off hand
 but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash and their motto
 is Working for a fagfree America with an implicit advocation for violence

I live in Colorado and have never heard of such a group  Obviously claims 
that their posters are appearing all over Colorado are a tad overdone 

 This is sick and it seems to be what you and Mr Hudson and others are
 embracing

Hardly  Saying that homosexuality is a sin is a far cry from 
Working for a fagfree America  Saying that I wouldn't want 
a homosexual babysitting for my kids doesnt mean I endorse 
Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash  

 We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression
 towards those we feel don't 'measure up'

And now we have homosexual advocates telling us that if we don't teach 
our kids that homosexuality is natural and a perfectly acceptable 
alternative lifestyle then they will have it done for us  No thanks 

 The Gospel I believe is not so negative rather it seeks ways to include
 people 

Absolutely  And the message is always go and sin no more  Not 
Go and do whatever feels good 

One question at the start of your post you wrote

 I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free
 form discriminationI may have lost face with the greater Christian
 community for the unpopularity of my beliefs but so did the abolitionists
 against the oppression of AfricanAmericans  Many were even killed and
 treated as runaway slaves for being niggerlovers and such  I guess I've
 decided the challenge is worth it

This sounds real nice but struck me as a little odd  You're 
presenting yourself as if you were a straight Xian who is sticking
his neck out and taking on the challenge of speaking out in support 
of gays in the church  But I was under the impression that you
yourself are gay  That's all well and fine but presenting yourself 
as sticking out your neck to help repressed others seems a bit 
untruthful under the circumstances

Similarly a person viewing an anonymous piece of land and a

These values are essentially subjective and that's why we have
markets to allow people to match their valuations of land and

holding a Jew the truth and you me the Jew and the SS guy all sit
down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives 
you present Obviously this is not possible and the best alternative seems
to be to lie  That's because other values are involved such as life
Now that IS just my opinion  don't confuse the claim 'objective morality

NB sir I could have responded with 'according to you truth does

Good question my point was that a world with truth is better than a world
with falsehood  A world in which it were possible to say yes I am
holding a Jew the truth and you me the Jew and the SS guy all sit
down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives 
you present Obviously this is not possible and the best alternative seems
to be to lie  That's because other values are involved such as life
Now that IS just my opinion  don't confuse the claim 'objective morality
exists' with the claim 'I have a lock on morals'

	So then it is not objectively better to tell the truth There are 
some subjective situations within which it is better to lie


	I agree that it is my subjective opinion that a world without SS 
troops and the like would be better It is also when using certain systems 
to judge the situations such as unitarianism that it is objectively better

Eric you bring up a point that I hadn't heard before and would like
explanation on  Did I understand you correctly when you said that
the idea that Christianity has an objective morality is absurd I read
it as saying that Christians don't claim any sense of abolute morality

I believe that the idea of objective morality is absurd becasuse all
the evidence I've seen indicates that morality and moral systems are
man made and thus subjective

This is not a shot at Christianity I would apply it to any other person
or group that advocates objective morality unless said persongroup
can provide some sort of evidence to support that claim

Actually Christians do claim an absolute morality but that is another
matter

I always heard it said that Christians claim a moral system but there is
no reason to follow it rather than any other  Is this more in line with 
what you meant

No not really

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expectsfears one might need

If that's true then it's a reasonable assumption that a person named
Dennis will never need an abortion and therefore you're already
not paying for it so what's your problem

a out of context
Must have missed when you said this about these other promises of god that we keep
getting subjected to  Could you please explain why I am wrong and they are OK
Or an acknowledgement of public hypocrisy Both or neither

So according to you Jim the only way to criticize one person for
taking a quote out of context without being a hypocrite is to post a
response to every person on trm who takes a quote out of context

Did I either ask or assert that  Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again

  Stephen said you took a quote out of context
  You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other trm article
     call it A that took a quote out of context
  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the
     lack of X  a common creationist error
  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the
     conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A

Excellent  Now under what conditions could such a conclusion be made other
than a direct assertion by his part  For instance am I to assume that
you have no position on eating shit merely because you have not said
your position or might a conclusion be made by observing that you do not

  I assumed you were being logical and that the sentence that begins
     Could you please explain  was not a nonsequitur but was intended
     to follow from the sentence that preceded it

Is that better Jim   It's called an argument  If you disagree with it
explain why the argument is not sound  I admit that my assumption in 
may have been a bit hasty  If you agree with it just say yup

Have you by chance ever even heard of inductive logic  You are not
demonstrating any familiarly with it ie you are being insufficiently
logical

These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
direct witness to God's existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
alike

  Lev  For the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given
  it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls for it is
  the blood that makes atonement for the soul

The Old Testament was very big on the eye for an eye business  It
makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to repay
moral wrongdoing

Brian K guess what  You missed the point  On a scale from cold to
hot you are at  degrees Kelvin

I know about sanctification  I've been taught all about it in Sunday
school catechism class and theology classes  But even after all
that I still can't accept it  Maybe I'm still not understanding it
or maybe I'm just understanding it all too well

Then as you understand it what is it

From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent
man is wrong

Yes  I agree with that  But what does that have to do with Jesus
Punishment you say  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment 

I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years
to accept it but I just can't 

Good  I wouldn't eithernot the way you understand it  

If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a good thing
then I would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert me
Be warned however that I've heard all the most common arguments
before and they just don't convince me

Ask Jesus himself  He himself said why in John   It
isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for
a persuasive argument   Read Jesus's own reply to your
question

Jesus gives more reasons in John   But one obvious reason
why Jesus died and as with everything else it has nothing do with
his punishment was that he could rise to life againso that
we would stop doubting and believe John   The fact
that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
from the dead  It is an obvious point  Do not overlook it
Without this obvious point I would have no hope
and my faith would be vanity

Why did Jesus suffer in his death  Again ask Jesus  Jesus
says why in John    That's no mystery either  The
world hates him without reason  It is a direct proclamation
of how far we humans botch things up and thus how much we
need a Saviour

And why can't you Brian K accept this  How can you  The
world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows
him  John    The animosity and the lack of knowledge
that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is
very convincing testimony of the truth of John  and 
I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of
knowledge I am not perfect either  But regardless of that I thank
God that Jesus revealed himself to me without whom I'd also be
bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very
Person who created me and who loves me

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expectsfears one might need
If one is opposed to abortion one should not be required to pay for
coverage of it because one will NEVER want to use that service and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder  

Does someone force you to carry health insurance
I will NEVER want to use my insurance to pay for
prostate surgery either do you think I should be
COMPELLED to pay for other people's glandular problems
when I ain't got one

As I recall the figure for just one of the molecules forming is   

If amino acids were somehow formed in an organic soup they must get out of 
it if they are to form larger molecules and evolve toward becoming proteins
useful for the formation of life  But once they get out of the water they 
are in the destructive ultraviolet light  By the same token bodies of water
are not conducive to the necessary chemistry  It is hard to see how
polymerisation sp could have proceeded in the primitive soup since
the presence
of water favors depolymerisation   

What is your degree in again  or should I say when  This is a 's
view of abiogenesis  PLease read something modern like Carle Woose's
On the Origins which he beats these warm little ponds into the ground

Look at archeobacteria  they live in areas so hot you would melt  
                        
And believe it or not we use their machinery everday in the pursuit of
new drugs therapies and knowledge

There are many other stubborn problems  The  amino acids needed for 
life's proteins are all left handed  If they formed randomly as the theory 
states what are the chances that all the one's needed for life's proteins

You mean your theory  Again arguing this point is like telling a child
that the sky will not fall  If the child is stubborn you will not get anywhere

would be left handed  

The P  They are left handed   Really this is not a big deal  There are
many problems with abiogenisis but these are really trivial

Please Jack rad some modern biololgy  i do not mean books by creationists
about modern biology  Pick up a text book and read  I think you
would like Woose's On the Origins  He is an arogant man but his writting

RE Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly


Unless Dennis's parents were excentric in their naming a girl with
a boy's name I strongly suspect that abortion might be a medical service
that his insurers were not counting on him requiring


When an insurance company attempted to set up lower rates for non smokers
in the early s they got spiked by the tobacco industry Anyone know what
the current status is on the smoking issue


If Denis really wants to have a fair insurance premium I take it he would 
be willing to have DNA fingerprinting done so that the company could weed out
all but the cast iron non risk cases

US health financing system sucks certainly its killing a hell of a lot of
people every year

  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the
     conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A
Excellent Now under what conditions could such a conclusion be made other
than a direct assertion by his part

Replace Stephen with David Joslin since you directed the same
accusation of hypocrisy at me  In email to me you wrote
    In trm Robert Weiss writes a promise from Psalm 
    Gee since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical you must be really
    busy arguing against these outofcontext extracted translations

As you may recall you mailed me six mail messages quoting articles by
Robert Weiss all sent within a few minutes of each other  You added
    Naturally I await your arguments against this outofcontext
    translation  But I shall not await holding my breath
and
    Wonder when you get to sleep disputing all these outofcontext
    extracted translations
and other similar comments 

Perhaps you could explain why you ever thought that I might have a
reason to read all of these articles you pulled off of trm much
less write responses to them  


Have you by chance ever even heard of inductive logic  You are not
demonstrating any familiarly with it ie you are being insufficiently
logical

I am familiar with inductive logic  Go ahead and give me the details
of the logic that led you to conclude incorrectly that I would
condone Robert Weiss taking verses out of context  Your conclusion was
wrong of course since I agree that both you and Robert Weiss were
guity of taking verses out of context  Nothing hypocritical about
that is there  

Since you reached a false conclusion you made some mistake in your
logic  The only question is where  Did you think that it would
be hypocritical for me not to post a reply to Robert Weiss' articles
Did you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack of
evidence for X with evidence for the lack of X   Is your grasp of
inductive logic not quite as firm as you think See if you can figure
out what your mistake was and learn from it

 COMMENT

 Shortly after that post I realized two things  I was running a fever of
 over  and that I probably should not have gone directly from reading
 altslack to posting on this august newsgroup

  it is not ad hominen to point out that Mr Archer willingly prints blatant
  lies
  in defense of Bible inerrancy and thus is worthless as an expert witness

  Okay Im game give us a listing of blatant lies from Encyclopedia of
  Biblical Difficulties or other Archer writings

 That would be interesting  If only a very short list can be generated
 I think it is more likely that Mr Archer with his inerancy mindset is
 not always impartial and made a doozy of a mistake  IMHO I also think
 that this mindset tends to generate these sorts of mistakes

 On the other hand if a long list can be generated it is more likely
 that Mr Archer intentionally uses deception in hs books Why should
 he be deceptive just with Tyre

 So Archer is just sitting around rubbing his hands and plotting how next
 to deceive  OK lets see the list

This was an open question  I assumed that if Mr Archer is a chronic
liar someone whould have documented it   This assumption is based on
how talkorigins regulars have documented numerous cases of Creationist
deceptions such as Duane Guish and his friends

No long list of Archer mistakes has yet been given so this may be just
an isolated incident

 My definition of objective would be absolute or fixed rather than

      Inotherwords any moral system that is still what we're talking
about right can be 'objective' provided you stick to it no matter
what Doesn't sound good to me stifles progress



Yup  This is me  I don't know why it crossposted  I was accessing nn 
from another system and that might have caused the glitch

I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or 
application of it  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth 
that is truth even though I may not know about it  

Some morals I wouldn't want to change and would not consider it progress 
for
a society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok  Some underlying 
themes morality honesty courage respect etc are used to base 
actions  I don't consider the idea that we should have been moral should 
be moral now and should be so in the future a limitation when it includes 
such morality  Aberrances in a moral system ie it is immoral to marry
someone of the opposite sex it is immoral to listen to rock and roll etc 
seem to be different than the above lists and if specific actions are given
moral status I tend to question those morals

If I can predict with almost  accuracy that Americans prefer to own their 
portions of the US than an infinitesmal portion of  in what sense are 
these values not objective  

Ahhhh  I see what you mean now

But in this example it is not the values that are objective but
the existence of those values  At least they are as objectively real
as anything is

I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that something is
better than nothing is a rational and objective valuation 

The term 'rational' does not apply to a simple statement like that
You would have to include the statement within a syllogism and
assert the rationility of the syllogism

A statement is just a statement  

As to its objectivity  well it depends what you mean

Values tend to be regarded as good or bad valid or invalid true or false
and so on  Objective values are those which must fall into one or other of
those options for all people  or if you are prepared for dissent then
they are those values which should be accepted by everyone
If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'

Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad or at
least right versus wrong or even just correct versus incorrect and
a way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour
In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort

Suppose you could predict with almost  accuracy that Americans
believed that something is better than nothing
You could usefully say that the existence of that value was an
objective fact  You could not say that the value itself was
objective   You could not do that unless you could prove that the
value was 'right'  Showing that everyone happens to accept the value
as right doesn't show that it is right

Do you agree with me then that the assertion no values are objective 
is false

Well I am a believer in a God  So I do believe that some values are
objective  But I usually suspend that belief when posting to ta
because it immediately invalidates subsequent arguments in the mind
of many ta readers

So ignoring the idea of a God I disagree with you
I believe in this limited context that 'no values are objective'

But I think that this thread is showing some crosspurpose debate
I think I understand your use of the word 'objective' when
relating it to values  I think it is an unusual usage but I
believe you are consistent given that usage

  However I have read a book
  
    GA Wells DidJesusExist
  
    ISBN 
  
  I found it to be thorough and interesting but perhaps not the end of the
  story
  
  Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
  to questions of science
 
      There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
      based on more than science alone  If you met a man who could walk on
      water raise people from the dead claimed to be the Son of God and
      then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect
      your belief in the origin of man  I can expand on this  Science and
      the Bible are not in contradiction  God can supercede the scientific
      laws as man understands them  Creation is a good example  God has the
      power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos
      If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the 
      substance of the book it must be a real laugher  Of course Jesus existed
      and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  I can give many if you
      are interested
 	If I were to experience this strange creature for myself perhaps
 
 	However one highly biased account as well as possibly internally 
 inconsistent written over  mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic
 devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more 
 objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature 
 was supposed to be doesn't convince me in the slightest especially when many
 of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of 
 guano

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony

I must correct the following in my previous posting
 
 If you are trying to be objective you must also recognise that
 
  the gospels are not independent sources on the contrary they
 share much of the same material

I should have been a bit more careful here  the gospels not only
tell us about the same events they usually use the same wordings
Textual analyses show that Matthew and Luke probably had a common
source which may have influenced Mark too

for the common humanity of others Please do not stoop to the
level of the E BA GT IYF WTOTC Protestants who think
that the best way to witness is to be strident intrusive loud
insulting and overbearingly selfrighteous

The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated get it 
Middle East  date palms  oh never mind but apparently acceptable 
on a steaminess level to be accepted as part of the canon From
this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with
Catholic doctrine

Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica Not necessarily a love
story between people of that faith but a love story that is not
exploitative does not seek redemption through penis size pays
proper respect to the dignity of each partner and is still erotic
enough to have a place on ass

I would submit that the Darknites series of stories qualify also
most of the Journal Entries and Rings I and II

I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and
increase the erotica I actually agree with you that nearly all of
the I've got an enormous dick and I shot my wad all over her face
stories are crap I count them as noise which makes my take on the
signaltonoise ration much lower than many other people's

Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write 
decent prose could you write a few stories for us instead of
overwhelming us with commentary  

 Anyway this is a big subject  PLEASE add your comments
 additions and observations
 
 Sincerely

  Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
  to questions of science  
 
 it  Did Jesus exist by G A Wells
 
      There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
      based on more than science alone  
 
 Nope no fallacy  Yep science is best in determining how religions handle
 why and who

        The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
        supernatural in the question of origins  Is this is a fair premise
        I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
        truth
 
      If you met a man who could walk on
      water raise people from the dead claimed to be the Son of God and
      then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect
      your belief in the origin of man  I can expand on this  
 
 Nope wouldn't affect my knowledge not belief of origins of anatomically
 modern humans  If that man could show me something better I'd change even if 
 it was the biblical story in exact detail  But then I would ask Why in the
 world did your father endow us with intellect and reason and then proceed to
 fool us  I mean the bible says nothing about the humanlike creatures that we
 know exist

        Some of these socalled humanlike creatures were apes  Some were
        humans  Some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments

 
 I doubt any of us will meet a man like this  But Bill if your version of all
 this is absolutely correct I'm still no worried about my salvation  I'll
 probaby make it I don't steal murder covet etc and I like to help other
 people  All I did was use the reason and intellect your god provided 
 He or she  benevolent and loving  will understand my dilemma don't you
 think 
           Good deeds do not justify a person in God's sight
           An atonement Jesus is needed to atone for sin
 
      Science and
      the Bible are not in contradiction  God can supercede the scientific
      laws as man understands them  Creation is a good example  God has the
      power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos
 
 Haven't been on to long but I have a feeling Bill that the veterans will
 agree with you here  No contradiciton and god can do anything at will  So
 what's the beef or more properly where's

     My point God is the creator  Look's like we agree
 
 
     If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the 
     substance of the book it must be a real laugher  Of course Jesus existed
     and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  I can give many if you
     are interested
 
 Its not a laugher Bill  Its a scholarly book that many happen to disagree
 with  I am definitely and seriously interested in confirmation  I know of
 the bible inferences therefrom eg prophecies apocrypha the Koran and
 others  What I am interested is independent evidence  Do you have any  I
 know of Josephus but this is almost certainly an insertion  Also I know of a
 few Roman documents eg Pliny but these deal only with early Christians
 Do you have any independent evidence  I am most interested  Please Email or 
 post  Thanks and best regards

     I'll send you some info via email
     Regards Bill

Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people

Excuse me  WHO destroyed the BD's  Last I knew they burned themselves
Prove to me that the FBI ATF or the Government in general either burned
the compound themselves or that the BD's had no choice but to commit
mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully a promise that was made

ARDon't understand the concept of insurance do you Anthony

On the contrary my friend

ARWhat is insurance for

ARTo spread the cost of illnessaccidentetc that does occur in a small
ARpercentage of cases over many  Those who do not face the accidentetc
ARhave peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did those
ARwho do face the accidentetc are not devestated financially anyhow
ARin dealing with it

Insurance is usally taken out buy the people who engage in the action
for which insurance might be used Would you ask a person who does not
drive to pay automobile insurance Or a person who doesn't believe that
medicine is worth the time to by health insurance

It is a pool of people who share a similer fear

ARThis 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances i
ARstupid  Bad things happen to good people too you know

Adrienne when you act to endander yourself or
others knowing that someone else may be burdened for your action is
irresponsible

 This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
 nervous because it has exposed a real scam

Dennis there are E things I pay taxes for and that I don't approve
of such as paying lawyers to postpone death sentences creating
silly weapons that are never used placing China as the preferred
nation while China doesn't have any human rights

The democracy works by selecting the people you want to govern and 
to make sure that your opinion is heard Remember what Spock said
the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many

As long as government spending does not contradict the Constitution
I don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected 
a group of people to make decisions in one direction And if this is 
bad then we should elect a new government Democratic systems work
this way and I don't have anything against you raising an opinion
in your case 

I just hope you realize that each individual should make their
own judgement and posting prefilled letters sounds like you
don't trust your fellow Americans to utter their own opinion
just your own

 that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
 from the dead  It is an obvious point  Do not overlook it
 Without this obvious point I would have no hope

Glad to hear this just a note Osiris Mithras and many other

 These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had
 expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
 direct witness to God's existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
 is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
 Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
 God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
 age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
 repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
 for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
 alike

Jews won't agree with you Malcolm

Get thee to a natural history museum or a library Mr Rawlins  How
do you explain the nearly complete skeletons of australopithecines and
other primal hominids like Homo erectus  Homo erectus was
certainly not an ape and it definitely was not a modern human either
Consider some of its morphological features small cranial capacity
supraorbital ridges receding forehead sharp angling of the occipital
bone receding chin large masseter muscles for chewing pentagonal
skull shape diastema between incisors and canines protruding
canines shovelshaped incisors  H erectus was bipedal though
So are these nearly complete skeletons of erectus human  Or ape
Or fanciful reconstructions  Have you even seen one

Correction to my prior post proper citation is

	Isaiah   Moreover the light of the moon shall
	   be as the light of the sun and the light of the 
	   sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days
	   in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of
	   his people and healeth the stroke of their wound
 
So we have to wait for the sun to nova

More along the lines of Hebrews  I reckon

	See that you refuse not him that speaks For if they
	escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much 
	more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that 
	speaks from heaven

	Whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised
	saying Yet once more I shake not the earth only but also
	heaven

	And this word Yet once more signifies the removing of
	those things that are shaken as of things that are made
	that those things which cannot be shaken may remain

	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved 
	let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably 
	with reverence and godly fear

	For our God is a consuming fire


Or nd Thessalonians 

	And to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord
	Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
 	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God
	and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ

	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from 
	the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power
 	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be
	admired in all them that believe because our testimony 
	among you was believed in that day 


Kinda gives Flaming a whole new meaning I reckon 

			         

The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming
of the Lord powerwise is going to be something that those who are
unprepared can't handle  kinda like overloading a fuse  due to 
guilt Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as 
we know it LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh 
as a reminder 

Seems that those who have been purified through salvation or that those
protected by the Seals will be the ones who survive And no  I don't 
have a good idea yet what being shielded by the seals actually involves 
or how exactly it relates to salvation Other than it involves the
marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride for those of you Biblical
well versed
			        

Me personally I'm totally  dependent on God through Christ so 
if God wants me to understand good If not also good If God wants
to save me or dispose of me that's great either way Being born in
the Spirit means being part of the Body of Christ Ephesians  so
who and what I was matters little  What's important is loving GOD 

Come Nova Nuke or Apocalypse  who cares Satan might even be able 
to pull off a pretty convincing fake Big deal Not worth fearing or 
worrying about though not before


		    The Greater Glory of GOD 
 	

Maybe Koresh is right maybe he isn't and it should be interesting to 
see the new message or prophecy The tour of the Bible I've taken in 
studying the passages he points to in the  text has been most re
warding But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears  which 
is not yet clear 

Much much more important is Charity  which by definition is 

	                   Love for GOD

I hope Dear Reader you've taken all this as an expression of faith 
 and not a statement of mere fact Seems many folks get real upset at 
 reminders

You now pushed down the defintion of objectivity into realm of
objective values So you need to explain that as well as well
as the objective subparts the objective atoms quarks
Firstly science has its basis in values not the other way round
You keep saying that I do not think it means what you think it
means
Perhaps you should explain what you think science has it's basis
in values means The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy
It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
results
Right

  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else
Twaddle You're overloading the meaning of the word value
that's all Whether I care if the results are true is a value
I fail to see how whether they are true correct whatever is
a value

  One cannot attach
any objective worth to the results of science  for the simple reason
that one cannot attach objective worth to anything  
You're overloading the value of worth too

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not

 Christian  washed in the blood of the lamb
 Mithraist  washed in the blood of the bull

 If anyone in netland is in the process of devising a new religion
 do not use the lamb or the bull because they have already been
 reserved  Please choose another animal preferably one not
 on the Endangered Species List  

How about washed in the blood of Barney the Dinosaur

	 In this case I would consider not saying anything to be a lie

A lie of omission as it were As opposed to an outright lie which I
believe would be termed a lie of commission

Or at the very least it implies that falsehood is on the same level of 
telling the truth Or we can stipulate that the SS have methods to make you 
say something only they can not control whether or not you say yes or
no Only that you will say one or the other

However not only are the outputs of science subjectively valued so are
the inputs  More problems  Which facts to observe   What
is a fact  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather
than noise  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I
do  As a loyal relativist I must assume that what's signal for me
may not be signal for you  The objectivity postulate should not sit
well with me

So the relativist attends to a system designed at whim fed with what should 
be assumed to be conflicting data in the expectation of results which need 
satisfy noone  GIGO

 
Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'
odwyersseie                                  from Hens  by Evelyn Conlon

As a loyal relativist  even you can partake in the wonders of
scientific discovery to borrow a phrase from D Letterman  Are you
like me  Do you like science and medicine

Difference is that science is based on consensus  The points above are
well made  and obviously there is some discussion as to what the
facts are in some cases  But if you are willing to play along with
the definitions  you too can hit the jackpot  Science also tends to
use the principle of totality vs locality  You can always look at a
small part of the macrocosm  yet those miniature pieces are still a
part of the total essence  So the facts to observe are those which
pertain to what questions you're asking  You may place a value on the
questions  but in many case  they are being asked just for the sake
of asking  And you can say that you're looking at a signal instead of
listening to noise  but the beauty of science is that it takes both
into account the totality aspect  For science to say that light is
a wave and NOT a particle or vice versa would be to ignore the total
essence that is light which is based upon the agreed upon definitions

Why even have definitions  Why agree upon them  Well to communicate in
such a way so that many will understand what you are saying  Where the
curiosity and drive come from I don't honestly know

I hope I haven't rambled too much  Not much sleep lately

  Good question my point was that a world with truth is better than a world
  with falsehood  A world in which it were possible to say yes I am
  holding a Jew the truth and you me the Jew and the SS guy all sit
  down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives 
  you present Obviously this is not possible and the best alternative seems
  to be to lie  That's because other values are involved such as life
  Now that IS just my opinion  don't confuse the claim 'objective morality
  exists' with the claim 'I have a lock on morals'
 
 I think that at this point it would actually be quite easy to
 confuse objective morality with relative morality
 
 jon
Actually jon that is quite true  Christian people have caused
objective morality to look very relative  After all that was the
point of the original question in this thread ie can we toss out
Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles  If you will bear with me I will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint

If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims then
He has a pretty welldefined concept of what makes people tick
physically emotionally etc  GOD has an objective morality for us
That is to say He has no trouble understanding what is good for or
detrimental to the creature He created 

	Galatians  For we mankind are His workmanship created in
	Christ Jesus for good works a morality which God prepared
	beforehand a welldefined design that we might walk in them

However contrary to what many people assume including the Pharasees
of the Bible God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations  To some extent every activity of a
person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's
objective morality for us 

Throughout history mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules objectivity if you please  In the Old Testament we have
both principles and specific rules  By the time of Jesus most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules
Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles  We mankind weren't comfortable with
the subjectivity of principles 

	For reference see Matthew  where Jesus explains the difference
	between the Law and the principles of the Law  For example in
	verses   You have heard that the ancients were told
	'You shall not commit murder'and 'Whoever commits murder shall
	be liable to the court'  But I say to you that everyone who is
	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court

The objective morality of God gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it  We Christians have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY
what God intended for us  If we Christians would stay committed to
seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's
objective morality for themselves  If Jesus is who he said he
wasis and that's the fundamental question then HE IS objective
morality

In article CFGFpanixcom mlspanixcom Michael Siemon writes

 The issue then is this

	Christian A says Behavior suchandsuch is sinful  What is
	Christian B supposed to do with such a statement

 One possibility always exists  A may be able to persuade B that the
 behavior in question does exhibit a failure in loving God or neighbor

Michael modern liberal that he is reads a fairly benign meaning
into this word  He then constructs his religious beliefs around
this understanding reading other scripture in the context of 
these commandments with love benignly understood

I regard love as no more or less benign than any other Christian does
You are merely expressing approval of the consequences I find therein
Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
or any religion  Love is a highly ambiguous word of which Christians
can write both the gentle words Paul uses of it in  Corinthians  in
a passage that even the conservatives will quote at you   and the
words of T S Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn Love is the unfamiliar Name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame 

This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise
in my note as will become more evident below

As a nonbeliever I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler

blechhh  I think you are misreading me rather seriously  Though
given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of sin on
another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism Russel Turpin
and others believers and unbelievers alike are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of Christian love

If I take him at
his word he cannot condemn the Inquisitors because they were
also following these commandments as they understood them  If

You misread  I can do and have repeatedly done a complete bill of
accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings in the first place and to respect for let alone love of God
in near succession  Please go back to my quoted words above

The possibility that always exists is that I or to revert to proper
time sequence my predecessors over the last several centuries could
persuade Christian B of my case that the Inquisition does indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love  I must also note
that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded  By Christian
argumentation as well as by secular both Christian and nonChristian
prohibitions

What Mr Turpin alludes to is a trickier point

	A  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
	    in the Inquisition

	B  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must however
	    painful this seems discipline her children for their
	    own good  in this case the salvation of their souls or
	    if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example
	    deterring others from the same lossofsoul

	A  I point out that this justification of a failure in love
	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable

	B  Burns me at the stake

My rhetoric has failed but the point I am making is sustained  What is
going on here has a lot to do with cultural baggage  In this case
the baggage includes a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture  The elimination of Inqisitorial
practice in those places where it has been eliminated or at least
greatly reduced has very little if anything to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between A and B

Mr Turpin is pointing out that if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B
then my persuasion is not very likely to work  I know this and in what
ever personal agony I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense
attorney  So one possibility fails in this case  as it will fail in
may others  At the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it
properly SHOULD not if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the
Inquisitor  And that is potentially an even more troubling case in that
many of the victims of Inquisition will have accepted that they were in
fact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them

The point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do NOT
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage  and given the main
thrust of the Inquisition against heresy it is bound to break down
in precisely the worst cases  The conservative I don't think that
is the right word BTW will take refuge in what I attribute to B above
that he is justified in causing harm because he thinks that works to
a greater good  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow
the gospel as if one's theories about sin entitled one to cast aside
Jesus' words on dealing with sinners cf Matthew ff

I am a radical Christian only in that I take the gospel seriously

Or for that matter what does it mean to love one's fellow
man And what is the right thing  And how does one go about
loving god 

Well the whole point of making these the base commandments is that
they aren't reducible to rules  A set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting  Such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies  but not if they are used instead of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions  The Great
Commandment is more than anything else a call to act as if you were
God and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action  A
demand that I like most would rather not hear but it keeps popping
up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more important
that I be open to trying this than succeeding at it  Conservatives
may twist this act as if you were God to mean lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules
They are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a
lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy
IS how God acts  That after all is the standard accusation against
God by the atheists here and elsewhere  That the conservatives have
confused THEIR manipulative hoopjumping notions of coercing other
people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard
American atheism  and I quite agree with it on this point

Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo
up front much of which sounds pretty much the same but by the
specific acts procedures and arguments that they recommend

And different bodies of Christians have from the beginning urged
different ethical systems or in some cases none  As a result
it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular
or infamous with Christianity  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH
It does not have a QU'RAN  Specifically Christian scripture has very
little if anything in the way of commandments  so little that
the Christians who desperately want commandments go mining for
them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation 
for their efforts  The one single thing in the gospels which Jesus
specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another

	I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson
	 that I hope to get to in a day or so  it is quite true that
	 SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT I'll
	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences and why
	 there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved

You are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical
system

But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do  It
may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems
 in which case I will profer the agapate allelou once again

I am glad that a few Christians
such as Michael find a benign meaning for the goo and then
interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive
fashion  On the other hand I do think that this tells us more
about Michael and Christians like him that it tells us about
Christianity 

I think you are begging the question Why don't I and the myriads
of other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity
Nor is this very new in Christianity  you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers from the th
century onwards and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case

 Based on the amount of EMail from fellow Christians who have read the
 posts and told me I was wasting my time with Butler and Joslin I told
 them I wasn't doing it for DB or  DJ but for other Christians  They
 have told me that DB's and DJ's arguments won't convince most Bible
 studying Christians  So I have reevaluated my purpose here and it's
 also contributed to my decision

 So most Biblestudying Christians won't be convinced by my arguments 
 And this is supposed to be a Good Thing I presume

Where does this Most Bible studying Christians think as Frank
does come from  And what implied good are you doing for other
Christians

At least some of what you are teaching has been demonstrated as
wrong  Has it ever occured to you that you may be doing more harm
than good to your fellow Christians

BTW I used to think like Frank does  I went to a fundamentalist
church for a while  I didn't start to really think about what
they were saying until I noticed a God's Science phamphlet
there  I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually
nothing about Science  I asked church members some questions about
theories from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers  I
began to notice a very similar style of answers for theological
questions as well  The only conclusion I could reach was that
these peoples' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as
their beliefs in their God's Science phamphlet

 If there are still people out there who think that my purpose here
 is to attack the Bible an accusation Frank once made I would point
 out that I have also criticized people who have posted bible
 contradictions that turn out to be silly out of context or easily
 and legitimately reconciled  I'm not attacking the Bible but 
 intellectual dishonesty about the Bible from either side

If one of the primary purposes of Christians is to seek out truth
how can people condemn you for doing this

  However I have read a book
  
    GA Wells DidJesusExist
  
    ISBN 
  
  I found it to be thorough and interesting but perhaps not the end of the
  story
  
  Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
  to questions of science
 
      There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
      based on more than science alone  If you met a man who could walk on
      water raise people from the dead claimed to be the Son of God and
      then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect
      your belief in the origin of man  I can expand on this  Science and
      the Bible are not in contradiction  God can supercede the scientific
      laws as man understands them  Creation is a good example  God has the
      power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos
      If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the 
      substance of the book it must be a real laugher  Of course Jesus existed
      and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  I can give many if you
      are interested
 	If I were to experience this strange creature for myself perhaps
 
 	However one highly biased account as well as possibly internally 
 inconsistent written over  mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic
 devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more 
 objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature 
 was supposed to be doesn't convince me in the slightest especially when many
 of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of 
 guano

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  
 

I have left all the above in as context

It is strange that you mention Josephus since Wells claims 
that historians and theologians widely regard the two mentions in Josephus to be 
Christian interpolations I have also heard others make this claim

In addition Wells claims that there are areas of disharmony in the four 
gospel accounts Any harmony that you find is perhaps not surprising as there 
seems to be evidence that Matthew and Luke are based on Mark and other
documents

In article Aprramboatlantadgcom wpratlantadgcom

        The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
        supernatural in the question of origins  Is this is a fair premise
        I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
        truth

Well I rather think that you have shown your hand here 

I suspect that many people would agree that the scientific method has replaced 
mythology and mysticism as method of finding out about the world One might even
call it the best source of truth we have available today

I will offer you a little deal

I will read the NT the OT and the Torah NT and OT will be NEB or RSV 
versions over the next  months if you will read DidJesusExist and stick
to it past the first chapter This is not such an onerous task on my part I will
admit as I have already decided to read the  I mentioned

Rick Anderson replied to my letter with

ra In article CELpLCacsubuffaloedu
ra psyrobtwubvmsbccbuffaloedu Robert Weiss says
ra
ra      Well Jason it's heretical in a few ways The first point is that
ra      this equates Lucifer and Jesus as being the same type of being
ra      However Lucifer is a created being Thou wast perfect in thy
ra      ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in
ra      thee Ezekiel  While Jesus is uncreated and the Creator of
ra      all things In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with
ra      God and the Word was God  The same was in the beginning with God
ra      All things were made by him and without him was not any thing made
ra      that was made John  And he is before all things and by
ra      him all things consist Colossians 
ra
ra    Your inference from the Ezekiel and John passages that Lucifer was
ra created and that Jesus was not depends on a particular interpetation of
ra the word create  one with which many Christians may not agree
ra Granted the Mormon belief that all of God's children including Christ
ra and Lucifer are eternally existent intelligences which were organized
ra into spirit children by God the term creation can apply equally well
ra to both of those passages

     Just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing You refer to
     differing interpretations of create and say that many Christians may
     not agree So what That is really irrelevant We do not base our faith
     on how many people think one way or another do we The bottom line is
     truth regardless of popularity of opinions

     Also I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
     and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the Mormon
     belief You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
     have been addressed In order to reply to the issue you have to address
     and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the
     conclusion that you grant

     The Bible states that Lucifer was created  The Bible states that Jesus
     is the creator of all The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
     belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same

ra      Your point that we all are brothers of Jesus and Lucifer is also
ra      heretical since we are not innately brothers and sisters of Christ
ra      We are adopted For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
ra      again to fear but ye have received the Spirit of adoption whereby
ra      we cry Abba Father Romans  and not the natural children
ra      of God It is only through faith that we even enter the family of
ra      God For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
ra      Galatians  And it is only through the manifestation of this
ra      faith in receiving Jesus that we are become the sons of God  But
ra      as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of
ra      God even to them that believe on his name Which were born not
ra      of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but
ra      of God John 
ra
ra    Has it occured to you Robert that being born of someone or being
ra of that person or Person's family may be a symbolic term in the New
ra Testament  Mormons believe that we are adopted into the House of
ra Israel through baptism and faith in Christ although some have expressed
ra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies

     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God Literally There is
     nothing symbolic about it This however contradicts what the Bible
     says The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God

          The field is the world the good seed are the children of the 
          kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one
          Matthew 

          I speak that which I have seen with my Father and ye do that which 
          ye have seen with your father John 

          Ye do the deeds of your father Then said they to him We be not 
          born of fornication we have one Father even God  Jesus said 
          unto them If God were your Father ye would love me for I 
          proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he 
          sent me  Why do ye not understand my speech even because ye 
          cannot hear my word  Ye are of your father the devil and the 
          lusts of your father ye will do He was a murderer from the 
          beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in 
          him When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a 
          liar and the father of it John 

          And said O full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of 
          the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease 
          to pervert the right ways of the Lord Acts 

          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
          world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit 
          that now worketh in the children of disobedience Ephesians 

          In this the children of God are manifest and the children of the 
          devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he 
          that loveth not his brother  John 

     One becomes a child of God

          But as many as received him to them gave he power to become the
          sons of God even to them that believe on his name John 

          Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that
          we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us
          not because it knew him not  Beloved now are we the sons of God
          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when
          he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he
          is  John 

     when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ

          Which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of
          the will of man but of God John 

          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
          Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
          Ephesians 

          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should
          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures James 

          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of
          God For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear
          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
          Father The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we
          are the children of God Romans 

          Beloved let us love one another for love is of God and every one
          that loveth is born of God and knoweth God  John 

          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and
          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
          begotten of him  John 

          For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
          Galatians 

ra      We are told that And this is life eternal that they might know
ra      thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent
ra      John  Life eternal is to know the only true God Yet the
ra      doctrines of the LDS that I have mentioned portray a vastly
ra      different Jesus a Jesus that cannot be reconciled with the Jesus of
ra      the Bible They are so far removed from each other that to proclaim
ra      one as being true denies the other from being true According to the
ra      Bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true God and
ra      not the construct of imagination
ra
ra
ra    Robert with all due respect who died and left you Chief Arbiter of
ra Correct Biblical Interpretation  I don't mean to be snotty about this
ra but the fact is that the Bible is so differently interpreted by different
ra groups of Biblical scholars what do you think of the Jehovah's
ra Witnesses for example that to make reference to the Jesus of the
ra Bible is simply ridiculous  Whose Jesus of the Bible do you mean

     This is really a red herring It doesn't address any issue raised but 
     rather it seeks to obfuscate The fact that some groups try to read 
     something into the Bible doesn't change what the Bible teaches For 
     example the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ 
     does not alter what the Bible teaches  Looking for that blessed hope
     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
     Christ Titus Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus
     Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through
     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ  Peter  
     on the Deity of Christ

     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches To discount or not 
     even address what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that 
     have differing views is selfdefeating To see what the Bible teaches 
     you have to look at the Bible

ra      Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation The
ra      Promised Messiah p  He had to work out his own salvation by
ra      doing the will of the Father in all things ibid p he had
ra      to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom Mormon
ra      Doctrine p
ra
ra    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine Robert  The
ra above books are by the late Bruce R McConkie a former general authority
ra of the LDS Church  Those books were not published by the Church nor do
ra they constitute offical doctrine  They consist of his opinions  Now
ra does that mean that what he says is not true  Not at all I'll have to
ra think about the idea of Christ's personal salvation before I come to any
ra conclusions myself  The conclusions I come to may seem heretical to
ra you but I'm prepared to accept that

     I find this rather curious When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is
     that Jesus needed to be saved I put forward some quotes from the late
     apostle Bruce McConkie The curious part is that no one addressed the
     issue of Jesus needing to be saved' Rick comes the closest with his I
     have my own conclusions to addressing the point

     Most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of
     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine' I don't
     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon That is not the
     issue  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
     subject is the real issue The indication from Rick is that they may 
     certainly be

 ev  After the Glorious Eve of Taxation

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law
The word of Sin is Restriction


To all whom it may concern 



It is known only to a few that there exists an external visible
organization of such men and women who having themselves found
the path to real selfknowledge and who having travelled the
burning sands are willing to give the benefit of their experience
and to act as spiritual guides to those who are willing to be
guided

While numberless societies associations orders groups etc
have been founded during the last thirty years in all parts of
the civilised world all following some line of occult study
yet there is but ONE ancient organization of genuine Mystics
which shows the seeker after truth a Royal Road to discover
The Lost Mysteries of Antiquity and to the Unveiling of the
One Hermetic Truth

This organization is known at the present time as the Ancient
Order of Oriental Templars  Ordo Templi Orientis  Otherwise
The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light

It is a Modern School of Magic  And like the ancient schools
of magic it derived its knowledge from the East  This Knowledge
was never its possessorssic It was recorded in symbol parable 
and allegory requiring a Key for its interpretation

This key can be placed within the reach of all those who apply
for membership to the Oriental Templars OTO 

The OTO is a body of Initiates in whose hands are
concentrated the secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders and of all
existing Masonic Degrees

The OTO although an Academia Masonica is not a Masonic Body
so far as the Craft degrees are concerned in the sense in which that
expression is usually understood in England and therefore in no way
conflicts with or infringes the just priveleges of the United Lodge
of England  English Master Masons in good standing by arrangement
on affiliation are admitted at reduced charges  Members of the IX
degree become partproprietors of the Estates and Goods of the Order
For further information see the publications of the OTO and the
synopsis of the degrees of the OTO

    We are talking about origins not merely science   Science cannot
    explain origins

So you have claimed but you have never explained why In detail

  For a person to exclude anything but science from
    the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
    than science  This is a false premise  By the way I enjoy science
    It is truly a wonder observing God's creation  Macroevolution is
    a mixture of  percent science and  percent religion guaranteed
    within three percent error  

Again you have claimed this but you have never explained You never
did explain how deducing macroevolution from its observable consequenses
effects is different from deducing Earth's roundness its position in
the solar system the existence of atoms and its components etc from
observable effects
Please do so or shut up on this subject

   Abortion in many cases is a choice birth is a necessary function to keep
   our population alive  To those who disagree with abortion I am sure cost
   is not a major factor

Make you the same deal I offered Doug  You and the rest of the prolifers
on this net can pay all prenatal and child bearing costs for those poor 
who want to have children and the prochoicers on the net will pay for the
abortions of the poor who don't want to have children  Deal

A more realistic offer would be

Those who object to paying for abortion can instead pay for the greater
cost of delivery that those who couldn't afford an abortion and wanted
one would be forced to go through while those of us who do not object to
public funding of abortions for those who can not afford medical care on
their own can pay for the smaller cost of an abortion for those who
decide that is what is best for them but are unable to afford it on their
own  Funny how those who object to paying their money to pay for other's
abortions end up paying more money than if they hadn't objected  People
need to realize that where your individual tax money goes is a meaningless
concept  It is probably unlikely that the fraction of your taxes that would
actually on average go towards such abortions would cover the cost of even
one entire abortion  Consider how many taxpayers there are how many
abortions are performed and how many would likely be paid for by public
funds and how much you pay in taxes and how much a typical abortion would
cost  I think the factors on the order of  involved will swamp the
rest

It's more realistic because we don't really object to paying for delivery
etc for those women who chose that but can't afford it

 My definition of objective would be absolute or fixed rather than
   subjective or varying and changing

      Inotherwords any moral system that is still what we're talking
about right can be 'objective' provided you stick to it no matter
what Doesn't sound good to me stifles progress

 I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or 
 application of it  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth 
 that is truth even though I may not know about it  

      Aha this would put the definition much closer to the moral
absolutism I'm more aquainted to debating

 Some morals I wouldn't want to change and would not consider it progress 
 for a society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok

      We all agree that it's rather unlikely as the definitions of
rape and murder are tied to the definitions of evil more like
impossible actually but what if some society someday actually hit
on a good sound reason for why rape and murder should be moral

 Some underlying themes morality honesty courage respect etc are
 used to base actions  I don't consider the idea that we should have
 been moral should be moral now and should be so in the future a
 limitation when it includes such morality

      I don't quite parse this but you seem to be saying absolute
morals are defensible insofar as we consider them good Which of
course is correct but then you need an absolute definition of good

 Aberrances in a moral system ie it is immoral to marry
 someone of the opposite sex it is immoral to listen to rock and roll etc 

      Hang on  what's an aberrance in a moral system
Do you mean moral codes that seem useless or bad perchance But your
judgement of what exactly is 'useless' andor 'bad' is your own opinion
subjective not objective

  if specific actions are given
 moral status I tend to question those morals

      Me too and add in all unmotivated morals and laws as well

mucho deleteo before and after 
   lots deleted here as well

Anyone who supports the legality of abortion but objects to it being
covered by a universal health care program that covers nearly everything
else as well is contradicting themselves  

  Actually I believe anyone that supports the legality of abortion but
  supports it being covered by a universal health care program is
  contradicting themselves  I am prochoice but I am also antigovernment
  fundingforabortion  Why  

  Example  if a prolifer writes on the net that abortion should be illegal
  heshe is immediately flamed with you have no right to impose your morals
  on everyone  If you don't support abortion don't have one but don't take
  the choice away from everyone  By supporting government funding I feel I
  would be saying If you don't support abortions tough because you are 
  paying for them anyway  To me this no longer makes it a mutually exclusive
  choice issue which invalidates a main argument of many prochoicers I
  would be forcing my morals on prolifers  In this respect I feel the 
  hypocrisy of supporting government funding and being pro'choice' greatly 
  outweighs any hypocrisy of not supporting government funding and being 
  prochoice

Ok one last time  yeah right  In order for you to not pay for any
abortions through your tax money everyone would have to not pay for
any abortions through tax money  If this is the case then women who
have reasons for needing an abortion but are unable to afford it on
their own are just out of luck  Their choice is blocked because of
econonmic hardshipwhich is part of why they might need the abortion
in the first placeand because some people don't want to pay for any
abortions  On top of that there is the assumed requirement that the
governemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it
which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion
This involves more money

Suppose instead there is government funding of abortions for women who
desire them but can not afford one on their own  Those who do not want
an abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered if they can
not afford it on their own and those who do want an abortion will be
able to get one and save the government money in the process  How then
are you paying for an abortion  Rather that abortion is paid for by
the cost of delivery that it saves and then some and all because
we remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure
Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery which is often used
as an example of elective surgery that is not generally paid for just
because it is desired and can not be afforded

If you insist on complaining about paying for someone's choice to have
an abortion when they can't afford it I will complain about paying for
the larger costs of restricting that choice when they can not afford it
Why should you pay for someone else's choice  Why should I pay more to
restrict someone's choice

a bunch of other stuff deleted  not related to me  

A prochoice majority would not be enough for one of the two prochoice
candidates to win however a prolife majority should have been enough
for the only prolife candidate to win  I think the fact that he didn't
says something about the number of prolife people in the country

  No it says something about abortion not being the most important issue to
  many prolifers as well as everyone else  I personally think it is 
  stupid to vote for someone because of their stance on one issue     

A prolifer who does not consider abortion an extreemly important issue
is an oxymoron  If it's not important enough for you to vote the way you
feel because of other issues then why should anyone take your insistance
that abortion is wrong seriously

                                                      People's perception
of the economy and Bush's apparent indifference coupled with a liberal
media were more likely explanations  

It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a clear
unbiased poll on the issues of abortion  In order to be unbiased there would
have to be allowance made for shades of grey rather than lump all of the
middle with one side by tricky wordingsuch as on the last poll I heard
about  Of course then we would know once and for all how the country
really feels about it and then what could we argue about

  other stuff deleted left for Ralph to answer

I still haven't heard of Clinton doing anything that sounded contrary to
my understanding of his position prior to the election nor anything I
object to

  He's already done a lot that I object to  but then I have yet to endure
  a president that hasn't 

Did you vote for him in the first place  You don't have to answer that
if you consider it none of our business

If you'll pay me  for every fetus terminated since
Roe v Wade  approx  I'll pay you 
for your martyr Dr Gunn
Deal

I think you are leaving out a great deal of other value  There is no
rational reason to give an abortionist a value  million times that
of a fetus  Why not  billion for instanceoh but then you would
loose on the deal

Instead we should look at what is really involved in each abortion
There is the loss of a human life a life that would otherwise have
eventually become a member of society  That is certainly a nonzero
value  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman who
finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy and the greater suffering
caused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it  That
woman is already a member of society

I argue that the cost of suffering of a real member of society is
far greater than the loss of a potential future member of society

Now as for your deal  Suppose you pay the value of all the suffering
of every woman who was denied an abortion or would have been denied
an abortion under your desired position  And we will pay the value
of all the potential future members of society that never became a part of
it or would not have been a part of it under our desired position

Think about it

Of course I expect you will object to my argument that suffering of
ongoing life is worse than loss of juststarting life  If so please
put forth some rational argument for how the life of a currently
nonsentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being
I figure if I ask enough places and such an arguement exists I should
eventually see it

Count me for one The simple theory that makes accurate predictions does so
whether or not we value it

If the quality x does not exist nothing has quality x  Which part did
you not understand

Frank you're desperately confusing science with the reasons we as
individuals and as a society want to do science 

Peter you may assert that I am confused about this all you want but
wishing it does not make it so   A simple theory is not simple until
someone judges it to be  A theory merely makes predictions  Predictions
are not accurate until someone judges them to be  You are choosing
theories at subjective whim in other words  At what point do things
get objective Peter

 Science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round 
 as you would wish it 

That's a mighty bold assertion Care to prove it

Theories judged to be simple by people  Predictions judged to
be accurate by people   These are value judgements and science doesn't 
work without them

 If there is no such thing as objective value then 
 science can not objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head

I never said it is useful or useless I say it is an accurate description
of what occurs people or no people values or no values

Accurate in whose opinion  Yours  Is the fact that it seems to be an 
accurate description which applies to everyone of no relevance  

 One assumes objective reality one doesn't know it  

But one can get supporting evidence from the fact that the reality behaves
the same way in the same situation every time that situaton occurs 

The same can not be said of morals

Confidently asserted falsehood  On the one hand people can demonstrate 
that they value freedom as consistently as they can report the rising of 
the sun  People will disagree if you say freeedom is worthless no less 
often than they will disagree if you say evolution or for that matter QM or
relativity is an accurate description of observed phenomena  On the
other hand even in the face of a certain amount of disagreement it remains
reasonable to believe in the value of freedom and that QM etc is an accurate 
description of observed phenomena

 you can't force your view of objective morality on me  
 
 Try me
 
 Note to readers outside ta    
 
 taite has been advocating violent civil disobedience in the US
 in order to promote his view that abortion should be illegal  Given the
 necessity and the opportunity I would have no objection to forcing 
 morality on him if that's what it would take to prevent him carrying out
 his stated desire to hang women who have multiple abortions 

What do you mean when you say I would have no objection

Right I mean that I would approve of and if necessary it isn't
assist in such force

Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
the use of force

With a few provisos yes  Minimum force for a start And it
depends on what is being forced on either side   

Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
that our own actions in doing so are not moral

My opinion is that our actions would be moral and it would be
immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective  
Again there many caveats and provisios

Note my usage of my opinion is an admission that I don't have a lock
on morals not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on

Another Gedanken experiment is selling the London bridge adjusted to
this situation selling USA for  to a foreign tourist Yet again
is this an objective deal

Good question  Under the assumption that things are as they are
and the seller is not the owner I assume this is what you mean
then one can say that with high confidence that this is a bad deal
for any tourist regardless of their private beliefs  There isn't
enough information to draw good conclusions about the seller  but one
could say with less confidence that it can be a good deal for any seller  
That the seller and buyer come out with different values on the deal is 
not relativism since in fact any number of disinterested observers can 
predict this which sounds pretty objective to me

Perhaps you should explain what you think science has it's basis

it's basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy
It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
results
Right

  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else
Twaddle You're overloading the meaning of the word value
that's all Whether I care if the results are true is a value
I fail to see how whether they are true correct whatever is
a value

The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it if you
care to look at it that way  however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth unless you care to follow the a
procedure to obtain truth science correctly  You have to pick 
the right procedure and note its importance  You've got to value it
Otherwise you don't care about actual truth and shouldn't object
to the statement objectivism is true

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively then we are using a maybenotquitesure
method on maybenotquitesure observations  That should lead
to maybenotquitesure results no  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable

No wait  I've a better idea  And the result's actual truth is
Yeah that's the ticket

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not

OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in any 
important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   DES
does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either

                              TRANSLATION

 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature O Arjuna become transcendental to these three modes Be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety and be
established in the self
  
                                PURPORT

 All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature They are meant for fruitive results which
cause bondage in the material world The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane Arjuna
as a student and friend of Lord Krsna is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where in the
beginning there is brahmajijnasa or questions on the supreme
transcendence All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence For them the Lord after creation of
the material world gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement When the activities for sense
gratification namely the karmakanda chapter are finished then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upanisads which are part of different Vedas as the Bhagavadgita is a
part of the fifth Veda namely the Mahabharata The Upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life

 As long as the material body exists there are actions and reactions in
the material modes One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress or cold and warmth and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss This
transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna

 It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
 results  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
 and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
 valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else  One cannot attach
 any objective worth to the results of science  for the simple reason
 that one cannot attach objective worth to anything

So what The value I assign the results is as real to me as they can get
I'm just not limited to how things are valuable to me Aside from our own
desires for its results science has no value Nevertheless it still
accurately describes how the universe works humans or no humans  

You were doing fine until that last sentence  I believe this too
but please prove it

  Which facts to observe

That's the value judgement you're confusing and a question for an
individual researcher For science the answer is unequvocal all

Impossible One observes the simple facts the ones that are likely to
turn up again  Judgement call  You can't observe everything and you
can't test every hypothesis  Therefore you select  That's a bunch
of subjective people judging the importance of obs and hypotheses 
can they do this reliably  

  What is a fact  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather than noise  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I do

You don't That's why it takes substantially more than one observation
before a newly observed phenomenon is judged to be real or noise I suppose
you didn't know that there are still people out there making observations
to further verify Fma 

judged to be real or noise  How do I do this  Do you do it the same
way as I do  How do we know this  Are we assuming an objective reality
or something  Gee maybe we are and judgement is necessary to find out
what it is

 So the relativist attends to a system designed at whim fed with what should 
 be assumed to be conflicting data in the expectation of results which need 
 satisfy noone  GIGO

Strawman You're mixing relativism in value for relativism in observation

Relativism in value  if we all pick different observations to study it
                       doesn't matter  We don't know which obs are
                       important

Relativism in value  if we all pick doctored observations to study it
                       doesn't matter  We don't know which obs are
                       important

Relativism in value  we all pick different systems to examine phenomena it
                       doesn't matter  We don't know which system works
                       well  Tarot cards are science too

No mixup  I still don't like the conclusions which is why I question
the premise that subjective value judgements can never be assumed to be 
reliable and therefore correct

You've been barking up this tree for some time and you haven't gotten
anywhere

I've been looking for the separation of church and state in Ireland since
I was  and haven't gotten anywhere  So what

Jonestown  It would have looked much worse if the feds had just
waited till they all committed suicide  This was a no win situation
although the final raid was a tragic failure  they should have
been able to get more people out alive

PS  The title for this thread is ridiculous  Feds couldn't give a hoot
about their religous ideas  weapons was the problem  Similar situations
have popped up with those I'm not gonna pay taxes freaks in Idaho etc 
where religion clearly has no bearing  Religous freedom here as an issue
is a complete smokescreen

Lots of good points re Mormons in the US

The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms At
least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the
US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance

I don't think that my lot were particularly mainstream in those days either
Mind you like the Budhists I somehow doubt the Quakers would ever form a
militant religious fanatic movement


  Or laws to stop companies from making lookalike FordGM car parts and
selling them as the real thing  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 's cars

Wooa there I have a classic car If I buy a body pannel for  after
being told that it is genuine BL and discover that it is a non original
copy value  I get real pissed If I can get the genuine article I will
pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit probably
meaning that its cheaper overall but it also means that the car is worth
a hell of a lot more Even on a twenty year old car there is a big
difference in a baddly restored car where much of the work needs to be
redone and a concours classic I got mine for  quid because it was
in a shitty state from bad repairs If it had been well repaired it would
be worth a hell of a lot more

Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for
infringing copyright on parts they don't make I find that very hard to
beleive In the UK they are very sympathetic  Ford recently dug out
the Cortina Mk I body press so that some company could make a few more
BL does amazing stuff they kept the entire assembly line for the MGs
and helped set up a company to remanufacture new bodyshells

There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off
The former I can't see anyone trying to stop Most car cos see classic
vehicles as a damn good ad for them The latter though is fraud If a
part is described to me as real GM and money taken under that assurance
when they know it ain't GM that's fraud


  It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in
everything for them who are really dangerous

It really is odd I post saying that the US govt does appauling things
under Regan Bush etc in foreign policy The right get really pissed 
Then when I point out that nobody seems to have posted a better suggestion
as to how to solve the WACO affair they come with the govt paranoia
bit It's like they reserve their ability to criticise the govt for 
when they feel their interests are threatened but don't give a cuss about
anyone else

You should revers that attitude When your interests are threatened its
way too late You have to challenge the govt when it is attacking
someone else's interests 

That does not mean however that you can start calling the govt the 
equivalent of the NAZI party on the basis of an unfortunate outcome
in a hostage situation

 Can you please point to something anything that proves to me that
 the universe cannot possibly be explained without accepting as a fact
 the existence of a god in precisely the way your holy book describes
 
 Can you please convince me that your religion is more than a very
 cleverlyconstructed fable and that it does indeed have some bearing
 on my own personal daytoday life

Would you consider the word of an eyewitness Peter to testify to the
events surrounding Jesus' life


 Pe    We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you
 about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were 
 eyewitnesses of his majesty

 Pe   For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the
 voice came to him from the Majestic Glory saying This is my Son whom 
 I love with him I am well pleased

 Pe   We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we
 were with him on the sacred mountain

 Pe    And we have the word of the prophets made more certain and
 you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark
 place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts

This is a documented testimony Perhaps further research on your part is
warranted before making more statements There is considerably more to study
in Peters' two books of testimony regarding the Messiah It is well worth 
your time Mr Brian

You were a liberal arts major weren'tcha

Guess you never saw that photo of the smallest logo in the world

Atoms trees electrons are all independently observable and

Just for the record  not that any kind of information would be
likely to affect your thinking  I have an MSEE  focus in
Electromagnetics  from Penn

A photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make
What was observed is something we can measure that matches what 
the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted  

Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and a
wave model for light the atomic model is a mathematical
representation of physical phenomena  A model that can and
probably will continue to change over time  That makes it 
subjective the model that is  However the model gives us an
objective way to talk about the physical world

To put it another way the Quantum Mechanical model of the atom
allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and
unambiguous results which is objective  However as Bohr and
Einstein duked it out midcentury the interpretation of
those reapeatable observable measurements is quite subjective
Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was
inherent in the nature of the universe  Einstein said particle
motion was deterministic but it was our measurement shortcomings
that introduced the randomness  They were talking about the
EXACT same results though

Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco

It seems they offed themselves perhaps in the selffulfillment of
prophecy Wouldn't be the first time
No it wouldn't be the first time a group has committed suicide to avoid the 
shame of capture and persecution  Ask the Jews  Go visit the ruins of Masada

We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of
their rights to worship and bear arms

Arms Automatic weapons grenades rocket launchers The sorts of things
no family should be without I guess Anyway I've often wondered what
business followers of Christ would have with weapons It's hard to imagine a
pistolpackin' Jesus though I suppose a pumpaction shotgun would have
made clearing the temple a hell of a lot easier
Automatic weapons Grenades Rocket launchers  I didn't see any other than
the ones toted by the government  I have a feeling the BATFFBI would have
been much more cautious had the BD's had a case or two of LAWS would have 
made a real hash of their cattle cars

I'll bet all you cult haters are happy now right  Just hope you're not next

Well when the nice federal officers come to my house to check out my
extensive weapons cache I'll just be sure not to shoot at them
Tea ladies and gentlemen
That's nice anybody attacks me my home or my loved ones with grenades or
automatic weapons and they won't be the only ones dealing death and destruction
Uncle Sammie was kind enough to provide me with an education that included 
studying the Constitution and even threw in a lot of time on the rifle range
My oath never said anything about bowing to tyranny although it did include 
to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies
both foreign and domestic  

It's very sad all those people died especially the kids but that's going
to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up
with a charismatic nutcase
How free a society is it when a religous minority is attacked by an armed
branch of government especially when the most the BATF would have had
jurisdiction for would have been essentially taxevasion Hope you got your
 in on time  From what you've said shit happens and we should just sit 
back and accept it  Not on your life  My ancestors came to this country to
escape religous intolerence and earned their freedom with blood and cordite
I'll defend mine with the same if need be

 One way or another  so much for patience Too bad you couldn't just
 wait Was the prospect of God's Message just too much to take
 
 So you believe that David Koresh really is Jesus Christ
 
         They cut off the water there were no fire trucks present and
 the FBIATF go blasting holes into the builing and firing gas munitions
 The building burns almost everyone dies  It probably doesn't bother
 you much but it bothers many other peoplemost of whom dont believe
 particularly in Koresh or his message
 
         Four ATF agents and  branch Davidians are now dead because of
 crazy tactics on the part of the ATF and FBI
 
         Attorney General Vampira tells us that todays events were suppose
 to save those in the compound  Blowing holes in a building and
 gassing those inside was supposed to save them

My two cents

It is a sad sad day I never thought I'd be defending religious
people especially extremists but I am mourning the murders of
David Koresh and his followers I believe they deserved the right
to life liberty the pursuit of happiness and the right to worship
as they saw fit Those rights and the lives of innocent men women
some pregnant and children were sacrificed to save the Federal
Government from being embarrassed Had the Branch Davidians taken
their case to court the black eye the BATF earned themselves would
have been multiplied many times over

I also mourn the deaths of the BATF agents although the deceptions
carried out against them by our government were nothing compared to
the atrocities against the Branch Davidians

Attorney General Vampira claims to have made the best decision she
could based on the information she was given This is possible Officials
in higher positions than hers have been duped We have no choice so
we may as well give her another chance Even if she is truly evil
it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time

I'm considering joining the NRA

Finally I have one question What happened to the Federal agents that
had supposedly infiltrated the Branch Davidians' organization and
started this whole debacle

How does one falsify any origin theory For example are a forever existing
universe or abiogenesis strictly falsifiable

The same way that any theory is proven false  You examine the predicitions
that the theory makes and try to observe them  If you don't or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen then you have some 
evidence against the theory  If the theory can't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations then you say that it is false

For example people used to believe that the earth had been created
 years ago  But as evidence showed that predictions from this 
theory were not true it was abandoned

Russ PaulJones
russpjmicrosoftcom

But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In many types ofexperiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again
and be capable of being observed For example in chemistry someone may predict
the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction 
repeatedly You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that
produced life So it seems we could never say That's exactly how it happenedAs far as we know that event was unobserved At least no one has admitted
it   So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability
strictly speaking are lacking

 So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
 on their house killing most of the people inside
 

I would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian  They were acting in
direct contradiction to scripture  Jesus' Second Coming is something
that everyone will know of  Jesus also predicted that there will be
false Messiahs who will use His name  His prophecy has been fulfilled

 I'm not that annoyed about the adults they knew supposedly what
 they were doing and it's their own actions
 
 What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside
 including mothers let the children suffer and die during awful
 conditions


I agree with you there
 
 If this is considered religious following to the end I'm proud
 that I don't follow such fanatical and noncompassionate religions


Me too  I have already given my life to God  If God tells me to lay
down my life it will be to save another life
 
 You might want to die for whatever purpose but please spare
 the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all
 
 I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity
 knows about the word compassion Christians do you think 
 the actions today would produce a good picture of your 
 religion


Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call
themselves Christian and yet are not  The BD's contradicted scripture
in their actions  They were NOT Christian  Simple as that  Perhaps
you have read too much into what the media has portrayed  Ask any
truebelieving Christian and you will find that they will deny any
association with the BD's  Even the th Day Adventists have denied any
further ties with this cult which was what they were

Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein a 
supposedly devout Muslim  I don't  Saddam is just a dictator using
the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends

  not everyone will  This option is now open to people other than just
  Jews  Of course if the Jews don't accept the deity of Christ I would
  hardly expect them to accept anything that Christ said  But I don't feel
  any animosity towards them  Even though they persecuted Jesus and his
  disciples and eventually crucified Him I bear them no ill will  If anything
  I feel pity for them  Jesus had to die to pay the price for our sins and
  so the Jews were merely fulfilling prophesy  Jesus knew He had to die even
  before He began His ministry  That demonstrates the great depth of His love
  for us
 
 Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the
 children who died today at the Davidian complex
 
 Sorry but the events today made me even more negative concering
 organized religion
 

I understand and sympathize with your pain  What happened in Waco was a very
sad tradgedy  Don't take it out on us Christians though  The Branch
Davidians were not an organized religion  They were a cult led by a egomaniac
cult leader  The Christian faith stands only on the shoulders of one man
the Lord of Lords and King of Kings Jesus Christ   BTW David Koresh was NOT
Jesus Christ as he claimed

 Do you even have anecdotal evidence to back this up  The most blatent
 persecution of the Jews in history was of course done by the Nazis before
 and during World War II a predominately Lutheran crowd  Sure many
 Muslims in the Middle East consider the Israelites to be a thorn in their
 side but the most of the modern persecution of Jews has been at the hands
 of Christians at least as far as I'm aware

Do you consider NeoNazis and white supremists to be Christian  I'd hardly
classify them as Christian  Do they follow the teachings of Christ  Love
one another  Love your neighbour as yourself  Love your enemies  Is Jesus
Christ their Lord and Saviour  By the persecution of Jews they are violating
all the precepts of what Christ died for  They are in direct violation of
the teachings of Christ  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
of that time loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
sins  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else

For those who think David Koresh didn't have a solid structure
or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast

I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon  It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most people

I've enclosed a partial list of the sources he cites or quotes
he exactly used As a Christian sermon it's pretty good if not 
inspired

Though I differ in part on some of his conclusions the argument 
he presents is well backed  which is why it's taken me this long
to work through  still ongoing 

If you thought it was rambling  that says far more about you than
it does Koresh There is a very definite relationship between the

You've made me curious  What does this say about me

First Seal in Revelation  the entirety of Psalms  and the
most of Revelation   which demonstrated one of his major points 
about how the writings in the Prophets including David and in 
the Psalms and in Revelation are all telling the same story when 
you understand how they're related ie have the key The largely 
explain each other 

Charles Manson used revelation as well  Do we see a pattern here
I wonder of Koresh liked the Beatles


The sequence following is keyed to the Koresh tape should you care
to check it out You can almost see the note cards he used when 
doing the analysis 

	long list of Biblical references which
	 impressed me tremendously but were deleted
	 in the interests of common sense

Koresh was a nut okay  Just because he found ways for the Bible
to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook


Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed
for the message he carried 

I'll type this very slowly so that you can understand  He either set
the fire himself or told his followers to do so  Don't make him out to
be a martyr  He did not get killed he killed himself


In the mean time we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption
Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten


The evil was inside the compound  All that thou shalt not kill stuff

Oh yeah one last point for the believers  Philippian 

For the rest of us could you please post the text

cobbalexialisuiucedu Mike Cobb writes

I'll yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way
to discuss it  If you're interested in a change here's an idea

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What right do
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality
Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your brother and say that I was 
exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didn't want
anyone forcing their morality on me or I don't follow your morality 

Yes and then you can suffer the consequences in our collective decision to
incarcerate you for that act Morality is not a necessity for a functional
collection of peoples just a set of acceptable behaviours is this the same
thing  There is no universal moral standard as there are many different
situations in which collections of social organisms find themselves Some
species of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of male
bees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony The
bees die of course but it was for the good of the colony as a whole so was
it immoral 

Our society at least our western one is one of abundance when it comes to
the basics food water and shelter  Therefore our moral standards are
based upon those circumstances  Unfortunately we enforce our moral
standards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations
because we believe in some universal morality  What I am saying is that
yes you CAN still murder my sibling but don't expect your peers to be
impressed by it in our society However in some other circumstances it may
actually be a moral thing to do in which case it wouldn't be called
murder probably sacrifice After the act you could say what you liked
but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society will
condone your act so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself including
how you will feel about it remember your feelings have been socially
imbued

Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get

You are making a ludicrous suggestion

 We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of
 their rights to worship and bear arms  Now we don't

Does that include the right to murder little children  How about killing
ATF officers  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas but 
Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades grenade launchers and rocket
launchers  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under 
right to bear arms
 
 Of course to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record  It has
 happened before

Please explain  I do not remember Jews or Mormons as a group overtly 
breaking a judicious aka nonNazi law and being punished for it
 
 I'll bet all you cult haters are happy now right  Just hope you're not next

If it were a sin to violate Sunday no one could
ever be forgiven for that for Jesus never kept Sunday holy  He only
recognized one day of the seven as holy

Jesus also recognized other holy days like the Passover  Acts  says 
that no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary
The sabbath is not in the list nor do any of the epistles instruct people
to keep the th day while Christians were living among people who did not
keep the th day  It looks like that would have been a problem

Instead we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike
Romans  and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of
food we eat Jewish holy days we keep or in regard to the sabbath Col 

The
question is On what authority do we proclaim that the requirements of the
fourth commandment are no longer relevant to modern Christians

I don't think that the Sabbath or any other command of the law is totally
irrelevant to modern Christians but what about Collosions  where it says
that we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath

 Can you please point to something anything that proves to me that
 the universe cannot possibly be explained without accepting as a fact
 the existence of a god in precisely the way your holy book describes
 
 Can you please convince me that your religion is more than a very
 cleverlyconstructed fable and that it does indeed have some bearing
 on my own personal daytoday life

Would you consider the word of an eyewitness Peter to testify to the
events surrounding Jesus' life

No  There are two problems here

 Peter died two millenia ago  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust  If he were alive today and I could
question him then this might lend credibility to your claims but
probably not much because after all I've heard people claim with all
sincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently  But after his
death Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries and I
find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to
change the wording of something to make it in his opinion a little
easier to understand

 Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago
that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is God
might just be Satan trying to convince everyone that he's a nice
guy or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
today

Nice try but it just isn't enough to convince me especially since
your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way
I've observed the world to work  Please find something more compelling

They Thelema Lodge don't have an internet address but they do have a CIS

I'm actually not trying to make a point  I'm just trying to find out the
coherence of the societally based morality position  Is my assumption of
societally based morals wrong  

No but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get
to a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful
The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major
defining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now and
is the part of both disciplines as social psychology that strikes me
as most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the
net

An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of social norms in
action is the micro sociology of Ervin Goffman  There are some very
good introductory essays Deference and Demeanor is a classic as
well as accessible books like Interaction Ritual  More difficult and
theoretical are some of his later books like Frame Analysis  But even
at his most academic Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily
jargonladen theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable

Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in
the setting of their expectations of other people and others' expectations
of them  This becomes systematized in a socially mandated way simply
because otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonal
realtions with every single interaction  and we engage in social inter
actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day so that a renego
tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion
We simply learn it most of it early along with language which is one
of the main exemplars

a theory  If you accept it as fact then that is faith and
not much different from religion  If you accept it as the

They do not want to know it or be exposed to light 
because their own evil deeds will be uncovered  And so by their
own choice they will remain in darkness  Sort of like bugs under
a rock  However some people but not many will not like the
darkness  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be
comfortable  These people will crawl out from under the rock
and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light
and enjoy its warm  And after a while by virtue of the light
they will see the depths of their own shortcomings AND how to correct them 
And also they will see that there is much much more to this world
than just the narrow little experiences under the rock  They will 
discover that life under a rock was incredibly yukky and that
life with the Light of the World is great  So great that they
will want to tell all their friends about it

And I maintain

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms  And so by
their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bugs
under a rock  However some people but not many will not like the
darkness  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable
These people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded
at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth  And
after a while now that they can see things for what they really are
they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places
they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky and that life on their own terms is great
 so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it

Do you see my point  I think you're the one under the rock and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism  come and join me  It will be
a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the
long hike but it's well worth it

Not all people hate light Kent We all have an adversion to it to some
extent  But Brian Kendig who has been replying to this thread certainly likes
darkness  Brian K enjoys stating false concepts and false pressumptions
about the God of the Bible  Without checking his own presumptions
he compares my God with Odin or Zeus

Look you just practically equated Odin and Zeus  They're as much
different as your god is from them

Don't you see  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness
with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not
something as megapowerful as what you're trying to get me to accept
Surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good
reason to don't you

Withough checking his own
presumption he thinks hell is the equivalent of nonexistence

When did I say that  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead
of being subject to the whims of a deity but that if the deity
decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am then so be it

Do you enjoy darkness  Most people will honestly admit yes  Most people
are fond of their sexual sins their hording of money their
selfishness and not to mention their Biblical ignorance

Nope  most people are Christian  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable
place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little
sheep  You enjoy darkness and you're proud of it

You may know the Bible well  but have you read any of the Koran  Or
Zen writings  Or Hare Krishna literature  If you haven't then how
can you say you have an open mind

Sin is fun  Let's
admit it  But a life of sin leads to trouble and death in this
life and hell in the next

Nope  You make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your
failures then you die  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments then you've led a
good life

Come out from under the rock  

Please do

    For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son
    that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
    life

I'm sorry I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in
which case it's not really all that important

Forget the Bible for a minute  Forget quoting verses forget about
who said what about this or that  Show me  Picture just you and me
and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you're right

Mr Esam AbdelRahem writes

I urge you all to vote NO to the formation of the news group ''AHMADYAISLAM''
If they want to have their own group the word ISLAM shouldnot be attached to 
the name of such group We don't consider them as Muslims


Dr Tahir Ijaz comments on Esam AbdelRahem's statement

But the problem is We consider ourself to be Muslims even though you don't
Luckily faith is determined by what one believes and is a personal matter
You cannot declare the faith of someone else


Mr Jawad Ali then comments on Tahir Ijaz's statement

You are not considering the consequences of your argument  The converse
would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider Ahmadies to be
Muslims  Who one considers to be one's cobeliever is also a personal
matter  It would be just as wrong to tell the Muslims who should be
included in their selfdefination


The argument by Jawad Ali is funny He writes
The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims

Which is a wrong statement In the light of Dr Ijaz's statement the
above statement should be corrected
is that some nonAhmadi Muslims
don't consider AhmadiMuslims as Muslims

So the problem does not get solved Who is a muslims and who is not
Humans cannot decide Humans may not declare others faiths Its that 
simple I don't understand why the mere use of the word ISLAM is
becomming such a big issue I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject and all they say No NO you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup  

I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of other's faiths Who gives them this authority Quran or
Hadith or something else I want to know this 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers Did EVER the 
Holy Prophet of Islam Muhammad PBUH say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim

No You are not a Muslim  

NEVER I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam

Hence if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone how
could the Muslims Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad PBUH  


Sincerely
Nabeel

Another dodge  Oh well  I'm no match for your amazing repertoire

You asked for an apology  I'm not going to apologize for pointing out
that your strawman argument was a strawman argument  Nor for saying
that your list of bible contradictions shows such low standards of
scholarship that it should be an embarrassment to antiinerrantists
just as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies  Nor
for objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context  Nor
for pointing out that they do it too is not an excuse Nor for calling
your red herrings and smoke screens what they are

I'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite  It's true that I
haven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles which may be due in
part to the fact that I almost never read his articles  But I have
responded to both you and Frank DeCenso a fundieinerrantist  Both
you and Frank have taken quotes out of context and I've objected to
both of you doing so  I've criticized bad arguments both when they
were yours and I agreed with the conclusion that the Bible is not
inerrant and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the
conclusion  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions
and for trying to explain me away without addressing the objections
I raise you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational Frank
by accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible I
don't see that any of this is hypocritical nor do I apologize for it

I do apologize however for having offended you in any other way

Happy now

 I think you misunderstand  Suppose you have a couple of gas atoms in a
 container  If you ionise one of them you generally assume that the other is
 not affected  This is only true to a certain degree of accuracy luckily
 there are all sorts of effects we can ignore when doing chemistry  Like
 gravitational forces for example because they're very weak

Agreed But your original posting seemed to me to be just another 
Heisenbergian misunderstanding of what chemists do  Heisenberg
said biologists are treating atoms just like they were solid balls
This is what some chemists used to do too but this is not how
chemistry is taught today
 
 And I agree  I think you merely misunderstood the point I was trying to
 make which is that we simplify the real situation to something we can deal
 with  For instance we talk about electron pairs and draw diagrams of
 molecules with little markings to show these pairs of electrons  This is
 actually nonsense but it's a perfectly good model for predicting all kinds
 of chemical reactions

Your original posting shows that you seem to think chemists still think
this way It is true that basic chemistry is still taught in terms of
electron pairs and valences but this is not what chemists are taught 
and this is not how they should think 

I suggest you take a look at PW Atkins's classic text Physical Chemistry
th ed Oxford University Press  to see how chemistry is taught today

However I still agree with your point  concepts must be allowed to
operate at a pragmatic level In chemistry this usually means we must use
different models for different situations It is unfair to say that
chemists simply ignore effects they can't deal with  on the contrary
they are quite concerned with the limitations of their models 
 
 I remember thinking the first time I saw the shapes of the electron
 orbitals They have got to be kidding

If someone insists that electron is confined inside these shapes
it would indeed constitute a joke The shapes are still important 
even though they are only visual representations of the radial and
angular functions The surfaces are arbitrary and not really important  
what is more important in chemistry are the signs of the wavefunctions

Is there something wrong with the representations

   The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms At
   least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the
   US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance

Sigh see what our school systems are producing  Total confusion
The original English settlers were probably the most intolerant lot
of people to ever assemble  However the Founding Fathers
Washington Jefferson Madison etc practically made it their
life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy
their great experiment a democratic republic

I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's and
Madison's writings Particularly good is Madison's somethingand
Remonstrance yea I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells
   IMHO Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American's
who ever lived Although both were products of their time Jefferson
was a slave owner they were able to see more clearly than their
contemporaries and for that matter more clearly than most modern
politicians Their prose is the epitome of eloquence I don't know
about y'all but reading the Declaration of Independence give me
mental goosebumps For those who have never read it I am appending a
copy of it



In CONGRESS July  

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and
equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle
them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation

We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created
equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness  That to secure these rights Governments are instituted
among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it
and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness  Prudence
indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience
hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are
sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which
they are accustomed  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations
pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to
throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future
security

Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies and such is
now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems
of Government  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States  To
prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world

He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary
for the public good

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing
importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should
be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend
to them

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large
districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of
Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and
formidable to tyrants only

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual
uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public
Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with
his measures

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with
manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people

He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause
others to be elected whereby the Legislative powers incapable of
Annihilation have returned to the People at large for their exercise
the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of
invasion from without and convulsions within

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States for that
purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners
refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and
raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his
Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of
their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries

He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of
Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance

He has kept among us in times of peace Standing Armies without the
consent of our legislatures

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to
the Civil power

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his Assent to
their Acts of pretended Legislation
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us
For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders
    which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent
For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring
    Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government and
    enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example
    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into
    these Colonies
For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws and
    altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments
For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested
    with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever

He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection
and waging War against us

He has plundered our seas ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns and
destroyed the lives of our people

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to
complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun
with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized
nation

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas
to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioners of
their friends and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured
to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian
Savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction
of all ages sexes and conditions

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in
the most humble terms  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only
by repeated injury  A Prince whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free
people

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature
    to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and
    settlement here
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity
    and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow
    these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections
    and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice of justice 
    and of consanguinity
We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
    Separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies 
    in War in Peace Friends

We therefore the Representatives of the united States of America in
General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the
world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the Name and by the
authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and
declare  That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be
Free and Independent States that they are Absolved from all
Allegiance to the British Crown and that all political connection
between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally
dissolved and that as Free and Independent States they have full
Power to levy War conclude Peace contract Alliances establish
Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States
may of right do  And for the support of this Declaration with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to
each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor

  Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who

 Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
 and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get
                                  
 You are making a ludicrous suggestion
 
 As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

And as an agnostic who's slightly aware of the Mormon Wars that Casper
describes I'd side with him on this Not that I support the Koreshians nor
do I support the Mormons but in a nasty sense the major difference is
this in  the Mormons kicked the US Army's ass In  the
Koreshians died in an inferno Chances are if things had turned out a
little differently we might have Koreshians posting to the Net a hundred
years from now talking about some future analogous event

Sigh I was waiting some some notsointelligent person to bring this
up  Look this is a country of laws To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance

 th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses 
 papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 
 shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon 
 probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and 
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
 or things to be seized 

No a noknock warrant is in clear violation of the th amendment
Okay what about the fact that they were tipped off  they shouldn't
have opened fire  right  WRONG  Think about this I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a noknock warrant So
being moronic sheep we wait with our guns holstered Now instead of
the Feds in comes my competition and we're history  The only
acceptable answer to a noknock warrant is blazing guns  I may sound
paranoid but our government is out of control and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it

Excuse me  WHO destroyed the BD's  Last I knew they burned themselves

   Where did you get this information  The FBI stated they were not
   aware of any mass suicide plans ditto Koresh's attorneys who appeared
   on Larry King's Live yesterday and the survivors claim the fire was started
   from the outside

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans  This may not even be an
accurate statement anyway since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information  We'll have to wait
   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say  Their credibility
is shot anyway since they origianlly said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover  We saw how accurate that was
   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves  You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people  All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

	Viewing from the net's initial reaction to the selfimmolation of the
Branch Davidians it would appear that this human tragedy is too flagrant
for some folks to keep from using it to push their peevish little ideologies
Others could not help but exercise comic relief but given the tension I
think this reaction is understandable My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmer
who makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts

	Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition

as if the public deaths of over  people were not a clear and definite 
warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets

	From where I set looks like Satan has a threebagger going

I'm short of patience tonite but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  
than the BDs got

 Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
 but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
 for destroying a people

The government sure gets a lot of mileage out of the word cult

Koresh's lawyers is most articulate on this point I think  The BATF
originally had a search warrant based on information that indicated
BD members converted semiautomatic weapons to fullauto  A
search warrant is a right to search not a right to bring a small
army for an Iwo Jima style assault  Everything the BATF did from
the start seemed designed to maximize the reaction they would get
from Koresh

	One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday One can argue about
the initial raid but it would be worth mentioning before the facts get
lost that

	 The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	during the initial raid

	 The Branch Davidians opened fire first

	It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians according to
the FBI's statements opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warning
over the phone and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenades
did so under fire from the compound


 
 The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act but that was
 an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started  War is bad

Even this seemingly obvious issue is far from settled  According to
Newsweek  some federal lawenforcement officials
now believe that at least some ATF agents were brought down by
friendly fire  The articles goes on to say how sources close to the
Justice Department claim that some agents were caught in heavy crossfire

	Clearly no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial 
shootout That's why they went in with riot control gas This would have worked
with minimal casualties The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gas
masks if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind



 precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation  That principle
 applies to all cases of warfare whether it's between nuclear superpowers
 feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt  Why
 was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
 also have worked  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than
 peoples' lives and religious beliefs  Perhaps the supposed professionals in
 our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid

Actually from a tactical standpoint the original raid on the BATF was
horribly planned  Sources in the FBI have been quoted extensively 
criticizing the BATF plan  The BATF raid does make sense however if
it was timed and planned to garner maximum media exposure for the BATF
which is always in danger of losing funding
	
Go in bust a few cultist heads wind up on the  pm news and you
don't have to worry about the budget for the next  years

	The question is whether yesterday's raid was wired tightly enough
Reno and Sessions both made statements to the press indicating that the
experts had not indicated that such a reaction was possible  likely 
They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masadalike mass suicide
could result from the introduction of nonlethal agents into the compound

	Some of these issues are highly technical  the impression I have
is that the Ranch Apocalypse represented a Rubrik's cube for the
counterterrorist types The Branch Davidians were too well armed for 
for a simple assault the BATF found this out the hard way The complex
was probably to big for the kind of surgical Delta Force coup de main
that the Bundesgrenschutz did in the s when one of their airliners
was highjacked by Black September The reason this seige had gone on
as long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options
and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice


Similarly why the raid yesterday  Reno has a bunch of different
answers she's shopping around none f which make much senOn
Nightline tonight she tried the we were concerned about child abuse
card and then it was pointed out that the info on the child abuse
was over two weeks old  Then she switched to the It couldn't go
on any longerstyle stuff until that kind of played out

	My own theory is that something was supposed to have happened
on Easter Koresh had made some statements building that idea up and 
Easter came and went with nothing happening It may be that the authorities
felt emboldened to move for this reason IT IS just a theory


Why yesterday  Because this was turning into a huge embarassment for
the Clinton administration

	I don't believe this is a valid argument Obviously hindsight
is  but the risks of doing anything to provoke the Davidians
were clear enough to warrant caution and to delay action


  It was interesting to watch the  club today  Pat Robertson said that the
 Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god He
 also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it 
 However I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
 world had a similarly humble 'cultstatus' beginning even and perhaps
 especially christianity  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
 Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled  Maybe David
 Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
 new major religion to me

Ever notice how quickly Christians adopt atheist arguments when it comes
to other religious groupslike every other denominationreligion is
irrational except their own particular one

	I imagine there are a good many people who are having some problems
processing the reality of this affair now 

	 This matter ties in with the infamous social scientists are not
	really scientists brouhaha on sciskeptic Here is a case where if
	one believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI the
	predictions of psychological experts were proven false not under
	laboratory conditions but in the cauldron of practical application

	 Koresh's actions or the actions of whoever started the fire  
	we're not likely to know what went on in there contrast so violently
	with the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find it
	difficult to understand why or how this happened Under such 
	conditions the search for scapegoats is only too natural a human
	reaction even though that is not a particularly Christian response
	either

	 Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult 
	members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex Her 
	grief must be monumental at this time and the search for a way to
	escape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewise
	real We may not have seen the end to the self depravation

	 The fact simply stated is that a good number of innocent children
	and notsoinnocent adults died horribly for no good reason It is
	exceptionally hard for us as human beings to accept this fact
	We can hope for some ultimate salvation some panacea to make it
	better but even though hope is a wonderful thing that doesn't
	make it so There is no meaning to this thing It just is

At least I can prove that money exists  Can you say the same for your

  Maybe David Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat
  opening epic for a new major religion to me  
 
 NOT  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world
 for a brief moment in time

I see  And what was that guy two thousand years ago who thought he
was god  Sounds like an egomanic to me  How do you know that Koresh
wasn't who he claimed

 Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the FBI
 Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers  Sick and    sad

Jesus allowed himself to be killed  Many of his followers have killed
and died for thier beliefs  Sorry I don't see the difference

I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me  I
really wish I could believe in him 'cos no matter how much confidence
I build up on my own the universe is a big place and it would be
so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it

I've gone into this with an open mind  I've layed my beliefs aside
from time to time when I've had doubt and I've prayed to see what
good that would do  I don't see what more I can do to open myself to
your god short of just deciding to believe for no good reason  And
if I decide to believe for no good reason why not believe in some
other god  Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate

All I know is that in all my searching even though I've set aside my
pride and decided that I want to know the truth no matter how
difficult it may be to accept I have never had any encounter with any
deity Christian or otherwise

Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself

Plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism
 
Straw man you are trying to replace pragmatics by morals And what about
a Subjectivis saying Subjectivismis better for me
 
 
Is good logic better than bad  Is good science better than bad   Ought
I to prefer simple theories with accurate predictions to complex and useless
theories   Is almost anything preferable to genocide Is there a sense in
which such value judgements are objective or not

 
Make those predictions and don't waste our time with circular definitions
and assertions without evidence In this example when genocide is so
commonly abhorred why does it happen so often in the context of religion
Does it allow to conclude that there is something about religion that
catalyses genocide Or in case it has nothing got to do with religion
that the premise is wrong genocide is not abhorred

it wouldn't be the first time a group has committed suicide to avoid the 
shame of capture and persecution

This group killed itself to fulfill its interpretation of prophecy
and to book a suite in Paradise taking innocent kids along for the
ride I hardly think the feds were motivated by persecution If they
were all Koresh would have had to do was surrender quietly to the
authorities without firing a shot to get the American people behind
him and put the feds in the hot seat But no God told him to play
the tough guy There's great strength in yielding but few appreciate
this

	Wouldn't it be nice if Subject lines had something to do
with nessage bodies

Yes

	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called
DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever

I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
would see stuff coming in from the outside

	Suppose that such a space existed and that our universe
looked like a Black Hole in it Then our Universe could be open
to it through Hawking radiation the same way Black Holes are
within our Universe Note this is all the purist speculation
and noone knows what laws govern QM beyond the event horizon
of our universe Can laws change at such boundaries of spacetime

I am personally convinced that what we call our universe is only a
small part of a larger system Further I think that it is logically 
necessary for the laws of our universe be confined to this universe
itself

Why do I believe this It is simple I believe that the odds against
there being only one universe and that universe having the right conditions
to support us are infinate I believe that to explain our existance in
this universe it is necessary to either consider multiple universes
an infinate number of them or intelligent design Since the only
intelligence that we know of is of a higher order than simple matter
the brain is made of matter by Ockham's razor I go for the first
choice

What's more there are a couple of books out dealing with popular
science that use parallel universes and holographic universes which
is another way of saying parallel to explain the behavior of particals
at the quantum level One is called Parallel Universes and I think it
is by Wolf the other The Holographic Universe

BTW the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in the
very physical reality of the universe

     With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider
the charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity I thought
the following quotes by Mr James Holly the AntiMasonic Flag Carrier
would amuse you all


     The following passages are exact quotes from The Southern 
Baptist Convention and Freemasonry by James L Holly MD President
of Mission and Ministry To Men Inc  N th St Beaumont TX 
 
 
     The inside cover of the book states Mission  Ministry to Men 
Inc hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of 
this booklet with two provisions one the material is not changed and
two the source is identified I have followed these provisions 
  
     Freemasonry is one of the allies of the Devil Page iv 
 
     The issue here is not moderate or conservative the issue is God
and the Devil Page vi 
 
     It is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public 
school education in America were Freemasons Page  
 
     Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His 
disciples and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian message
Page  
 
     The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity 
through fraternity liberty and equality is toleration This is seen 
in the writings of the 'great' writers of Freemasonry Page  
 
     He Jesus Christ established the most sectarian of all possible 
faiths Page  
 
     For narrowness and sectarianism there is no equal to the Lord 
Jesus Christ Page  
 
     What seems so right in the interest of toleration and its 
cousinsliberty equality and fraternityis actually one of the 
subtlest lies of the 'father of lies' Page  
 
     The Southern Baptist Convention has many churches which were 
founded in the Lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the 
Lodge Each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of 
repentance and of praying the blood and the Name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the 
dedication of the church andor building Page   
 

     I hope you all had a good laugh I know I did g


Tony   

I appreciate the narrowmindedness of the view expressed in
the text you quoted  I also appreciate your being amused
by such determined ignorance  Without taking anything away
from your mirth I want to say that these views sadden me
I can only hope that that sort of narrowmindedness will
die with the generations that have promoted it  Teach 
your children well

 They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
 nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building
 

Before you go absolving the BATF  FBI of all blame in this incident you should
probably be aware of two important facts
  There is no such thing as nontoxic tear gas  Tear gas is nonbreathable
    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting followed eventually
    by siezures and death  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people
    they exposed  Any potential heart problems among the BD's

  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister  Tear gas is produced by burning a
    chemical in the can  The fumes produced are tear gas  The canister has a 
    warning printed on the side of it  Contact with flamable material can result
    in fire  Now how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building 
    they admited was a firetrap

This whole thing was a case of overreaction by the officials at every step
I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held
accountable  But that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to
be investigating themselves

Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get

Actually after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo and later Carthage
the Mormons DID fortify Utah  They still arm themselves to defend the
faith and stockpile food as well  They have been involved in quite a
lot of illegal activity  including multiple and often underage wives
for the leaders  a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their
sect  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking

So what did the Mormons get  It seems that J Edgar Hoover was very
impressed with the way they kept secrets  They're pledged to defend
secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood  Many actually
do  even to the point of suicide  So he hired virtually no one but
Mormons until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the
Church of Later Day Saints  Though J Edgar is finally gone the FBI
personnel especially the field agents are still heavily Mormon

I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment
of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical

Ludicrous huh



 HEAVILY ARMED RELIGIOUS CULT BATTLES GOVERNMENT

 Troops have been called out after a skirmish involving government
 officials and a religious cult which has been gathering weapons in their
 private city

 The cult's leaders who claim that God speaks to them have told cult
 members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world which
 they believe to me imminent

 Weapons believed to be in their possession include largebore military
 weapons as well as sporting arms  A recent series in nearby newspapers
 has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region

 Troops have surrounded the cult's city after incidents in which
 officials have exchanged shots with cult members  There have been
 reports of children being seen in the cult compound where discipline is
 said to be strictly administered

 Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these Mormons are to
 be exterminated or driven from the state



And that's the news account from  years ago

  We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of
  their rights to worship and bear arms  Now we don't
 
 Does that include the right to murder little children  

Since the jury's not yet in on exactly how the fire REALLY started the
only dead children here for whom blame can be proven at the moment were 
the ones shot by government fire

 How about killing ATF officers 

A citizen has the right to stop ANY attacking criminal  even one with 
a uniform  Clothing aside you know it's still not legal to serve a
search warrant with a concussion grenade

 I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas but 
 Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades grenade launchers and rocket
 launchers  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under 
 right to bear arms

Well then find out

By the way this is not a claim of Koresh's folks it is a claim of 
the government  the same government which DID have grenades and grenade
launchers and DID use them  No one has seen ANY evidence of the BD's 
having much less using such weaponry  If they were stocking such things 
against Armageddon why would they have left them in the boxes when 
Armageddon actually arrived

  Of course to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record  It has
  happened before
 
 Please explain  I do not remember Jews or Mormons as a group overtly 
 breaking a judicious aka nonNazi law and being punished for it

See above for one example  The abuses involved were nonmainstream 
religious beliefs polygamy child abuse and fortification  Sound
familiar  In my opinion the BD's were as much a real threat to society
as the Mormons were then or are now  That is until they were provoked

By the way I find your statement about nonNazi law ironic  Koresh was 
suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of  which was BASED ON the
text of the Nazi Weapons Law of March    Gun Control's Nazi 
Connection Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership  S 
Wentworth Ave Milwaukee WI   

By the way what was Koresh's specific violation  FAILURE TO PAY A TAX
That's right  the BATF are TREASURY agents  Did a failure to pay a
gun tax really justify armed attack night torture and ultimately
the death penalty

  I'll bet all you cult haters are happy now right  Just hope you're not next

	One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday One can argue about
the initial raid but it would be worth mentioning before the facts get
lost that

	 The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	during the initial raid

	 The Branch Davidians opened fire first


   See this is what really bugs me about this whole incident and
   also about Usenet  Here we are almost two months after the original
   raid a raid witnessed by several members of the press and there is 
   STILL no agreement about the basic facts  Riggs here and others
   are claiming that the BD's shot first while others on the net claim
   that the feds did in the form of concussion grenades  

   I suggest that before ANY of you make any claims about who shot 
   first you DOCUMENT your claim with actual evidence and not just
   FOAF or he said  she said     Otherwise don't use words like
   fact above  it just makes you all look stupid

 We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of
 their rights to worship and bear arms

 Arms Automatic weapons grenades rocket launchers The sorts of things
 no family should be without I guess

All government claims  If they were really stocking such weapons for
Armageddon how come they never used them

 Anyway I've often wondered what
 business followers of Christ would have with weapons It's hard to imagine a
 pistolpackin' Jesus though I suppose a pumpaction shotgun would have
 made clearing the temple a hell of a lot easier

The time is coming  Those of you who have no sword sell your shirt and
 buy one And they told him Master we have two swords  And he said It 
 is enough  LUKE 

Think not that I am come to send peace on earth I came not to send peace
 but the sword For I am come to set a man at variance against his father
 and the daugher against her mother  MATT  

 Well when the nice federal officers come to my house to check out my
 extensive weapons cache I'll just be sure not to shoot at them
 Tea ladies and gentlemen

Just maybe you won't be home  Then you can come home to something 
like this

    Well it's been a rough month begins Johnnie Lawmaster  I
 just get laid off and my divorce became final  But I just wasn't
 ready for what happened this particular Monday

    That particular Monday was was December  the first day of the
 Bill of Rights' third century the day when federal agents and local
 law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew
 the US flag  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak
 afternoon one of his neighbors had some news

    'Ohmigod John you are in big trouble' my neighbor tells me
 'Sixty police federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house
 kicked down the door cut locks off your gun safe'  I couldn't
 believe it  Then I walked inside  What a nightmare

    It was no nightmare it was horribly real life  Apparently acting
 on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm some thirty
 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms BATF teamed up
 with state and Tulsa police authorities search warrant in hand to
 search for a Colt AR  caliber machine gun unknown serial
 number  The warrant issued by US Magistrate John Leo Wagner also
 authorized agents to seize any tools used in the alteration or
 modification of firearms such as files or drills documents papers
 books records and other tangible properties which identify occupants
 or owners of the property to be searched

    Reports vary but according to neighbors the joint task force
 operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital
 involved some  agents and local law enforcement personnel against
 Lawmaster  They cordoned off the street took station with weapons
 drawn in the back yard used a battering ram to break through the
 front door kicked in the back door broke into his gun safe threw
 personal papers around the house spilled boxes of ammunition on the
 floor broke into a small locked box that contained precious coins
 stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles breaking the table
 in the process  Then they left  The doors were closed but not
 latched much less locked  The ammo and guns were left unsecured

    My front and back doors were pulled shut but they were busted
 through and couldn't latch  Anybody could have waltzed in there and
 stolen everything I own  A child could have taken a gun  The guns
 the safe  everything was open and laying around  I keep all my
 magazines empty but someone had loaded them  While I was looking
 around in amazement the gas electric and water companies show up to
 turn the power off  They said they were told to shut things down
 Then I found the note  Nothing Found  ATF

    They didn't make any attempt to notify me  I've lived in Tulsa
 all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket  How come they
 can't look that up realize I've been lawabiding my whole life then
 come to the door when I'm home  They didn't leave someone here to
 watch over my private property  They didn't even come by to explain
 what happened  They just raided my home ransaked it left it wide
 open and left

    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent  I asked
 'Are you gonna' arrest me' and he said 'No'  I asken him Who is
 going to repair and clean up my house'  And he said If you're going
 to talk to me come down to my office'

    'I can't come down' I said  'My doors are broken'  If I had
 been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors I would have
 lost everything I own  Here I am a competent responsible firearms
 owner and the government leaves them open unlocked with ammo strewn
 around

    Lawmaster said the agent advised him If you want your door to
 lock and your gun safe to lock you're gonna' have to pay for it
 yourself

    'Oh I'll come right down alright' I told him  'I'll come
 down but I'll bring my attorney'  And he said 'Well you bring
 your attorney and we won't talk to you'


So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence make
sure your lawyer isn't there there's a good chap


 It's very sad all those people died especially the kids but that's going
 to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up
 with a charismatic nutcase

What a repulsive outlook on society  Followers of unusual religions
may be killed by the government  it simply can't be helped in a free
society

You and I have two different concepts of free

James Owens writes
 
You seem to be saying that God being unknowable His morality 
is unknowable
 
Yep that's pretty much it      
 
  
 
As I understand it the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all 
that was required whereas the Pharisees the ancestors of modern
Judaism believed that the Torah was available for interpretation 
to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its 
nuances Talmud
 
The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an 
interface between Man and YHWH for a Jew or Christian and does
not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that 
relationship although one can speculate
 
  
 
   the point Im trying to make is that we only really have the 
Bible to interpret and that interpretation is by humanity I guess 
this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent 
subjectiveness
 
God being unknowable I can't comment on His motives but it would be
distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of 
our own  For sanity's sake we must assume if we believe in Him at all
that His message comes through somehow  The question is whether it comes 
through immediately to every individual or is contained in a complex 
canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another 
or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free
to interpret extend and modify the canon  If God's message is indeed
mediated the further problem arises as to whether the individual under
stands the mediated message fully and clearly  Since the responsibility 
for understanding lies ultimately with the individual we must assume that 
God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source 
for that individual whereof the person may or may not drink 
 
Metaphysically if there are multiple moral codes then there is no
Absolute moral code and I think this is theologically questionable
 
No There may be an absolute moral code There are undoubtably multiple
moral codes The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code As an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is wrong Now the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar where there are no children The wrongness here is if
the child disobeys the parent The parent may feel that it is inappropriate
to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but
you get the gist of it Incidentally the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older see Piaget and learns a morality of his own
 
Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality
and politeness  You might have said burp for burping and swearing carry
about the same stigma today  If you are talking about taking the Lord's 
name in vain as a serious transgression then this example is more a case of 
hypocrisy than of varying moral codes
 
If there is an absolute moral code propositions or laws in that code apply
absolutely and universally by definition  Conceivably some moral codes
could be subsets of the universal code as you say at the outset  So for
example God's code could include Thou shalt not create Beings without
a hospitable planet to live on but this law would be inapplicable to us
Nevertheless we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable
to us are also applicable to God
 
But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code you have
a sense of the absurdity of the question  Does God make laws for Himself to
follow  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category morality
can be sensibly applied

the FBIATF go blasting holes into the builing and firing gas munitions
The building burns almost everyone dies  It probably doesn't bother
you much but it bothers many other peoplemost of whom dont believe
particularly in Koresh or his message

	Four ATF agents and  branch Davidians are now dead because of
crazy tactics on the part of the ATF and FBI

	Attorney General Vampira tells us that todays events were suppose
to save those in the compound  Blowing holes in a building and
gassing those inside was supposed to save them
 
Give me a break  What fireman should have to deal with a blaze like that
AND get shot at at the same time

These people were breaking the law  I agree these weren't the best tactics
they probably should have backed off pulled the perimeter way back and let
them sit there with no media attention until they decided to come out  The 
only other alternative I see would have been to send in a couple of special
forces guys to capture or assassinate Koresh  But remember these fruit
loops were putting their lives on the lines voluntarily  Why should 
lawabiding citizens have to put themselves in any more danger than necessary
when dealing with a nut  Look at the man who jumped out of his Bradley to
grab a flaming women who was running back into the building  Yeah I would
have to say they were trying to save those people  I don't think I would 
risk my life that much to save someone that stupid that obviously didn't
even want to be saved

 The other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism so that we
 can correct your misconceptions 
 
 Well I can cut to the chase and admit that what I find least attractive about
 realtivism is that it elevates the heinous to the level of the good by
 saying in effect to each his own or what's good for you  isn't good
 for me  Thus the terrorist is elevated to the same level as the man
 of peace

This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolute
standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality
are equally good

Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference
And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
it isn't an objective reality for values

Yes very true  The entire title is 'The Ancient and Mystical Order

They are considered different and largely unrelated by a number of
sources  I've seen documentation which links them through the figure
of H Spencer Lewis  Lewis was apparently involved with Reuss who
was the OHO of Ordo Templi Orientis for many years  Apparently it
is also true that Lewis had a charter to form an OTO body and then
created AMORC as a subsidiary  an interesting question

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent

A good point  What helps to keep such things going is the public
attitude that one should have faith that some authority from
on high should not be subjected to mere reason  Couple this with a
variety of personality quirks mojor and minor mental illnesses and
ego of wouldbe leaders and you get all the variety of cults and 
religions that people subscribe to

            IS THE MORMON CHURCH CHRIST'S TRUE CHURCH

lots of stuff about intellectual errors deleted

This is cute but I see no statement telling me why your church is the true 
church I do presume that you know or at least believe that yours is true 
Attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something better is 
a real good way to loose a person completely from Christ

This is the greatest reason I see that these attacks are not motivated by 
love They only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief 
This is not something Christ did He guided and instructed He didn't 
seek to destroy the faith He found He redirected it 

This is what I see when people say they love insert favorite group here 
And I have to laugh at the irony 

Please excuse the scarcasm but it was nice to say it

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

You appear to be stunningly ignorant of the underlying concept of health
insurance

Are you any less stunningly ignorant  Have you ever heard of life
insurance premiums some companies give in which nonsmokers are charged
much smaller premiums than smokers

Not to mention auto insurance being much cheaper for women under  than
for men under  because women on the average drive more carefully
than most menin fact almost as carefully as I did before I was

So what did the Mormons get  It seems that J Edgar Hoover was very
impressed with the way they kept secrets  They're pledged to defend
secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood  Many actually
do  even to the point of suicide  So he hired virtually no one but
Mormons until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the
Church of Later Day Saints  Though J Edgar is finally gone the FBI
personnel especially the field agents are still heavily Mormon
 
I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment
of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical
 

Hoover was for many years up near the top of my hate list  And I hold no 
brief for the FBI  But where does this notion come from that Hoover made 
special efforts to recruit LDS members  And is there credible evidence for 
the assertion that they are pledged to defend secrets with their lives and 
atone for sin with blood  I've known only a few Mormons but none of them 
seemed to me to fit this description  Sounds to me reminiscent of the Jewish 
and Masonicconspiracy theories of blessed memory

This was obviously a lot different than the ordinary FBI adventure

I believe that the Federal officers had a conflict of interests here

Throught out the whole affair it seamed to me that they were chiefly
concerned with saving face rather than saving lifes  Its true that
The BD were resisting arrest and that they should have surrendered
when they first realized that these where federal officers  But they
didnt  

But when they didnt the FBI should not have treated as a hostage
situation it wasn't  

I think  more discussions possible independant negotiators and
family intervention should have been used

Of course this is just monday morning Quartberbakingor is it


I dont think I shall every forget Reno responding to Ted
Koppels Questions last night  Watching the AG squirm when
telling us that the only reason they stepped it up a bit

I had said

 Merlyn you missed the point too  Christianity is a relationship  I have
 a relationship with my God  I know Him  

 Consider your mother Merlyn  You know your mother  What would you think
 of me if I asserted that your mother is  feet tall murdered your father
 and sexually abused you when you were a kid   Would you who knows your
 mother well think was a blind arrogant idiot to proclaim such things

Merlyn LeRoy says
 
This analogy is not good for example there are plenty of people who
know god as well as you do but don't agree on things like

 how many children heshe has
 whether heshe approves of polygamy
 whether Mohammed was one of hisher prophets

Now if you AND all these other people who ABSOLUTELY KNOW what god is
like can't agree on basic attributes like these at least one of you
who knows what this godthing is like must be wrong therefore
subjective certainty is worthless regarding knowledge of this god

On the other hand I don't know any large groups of people who claim
absolute knowledge of my mother and who disagree about her basic
attributes  This is the difference between real people and imaginary friends

Meryln therefore by your logic since your people disagree about
the characteristics of your mother you mother must be imaginary

 How does one falsify any origin theory For example are a forever existing
 universe or abiogenesis strictly falsifiable
 
 The same way that any theory is proven false  You examine the predicitions
 that the theory makes and try to observe them  If you don't or if you
 observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen then you have some 
 evidence against the theory  If the theory can't be modified to 
 incorporate the new observations then you say that it is false

 But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In many types ofexperiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again
and be capable of being observed For example in chemistry someone may predict
 the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction
repeatedly You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life So it seems we could never say That's exactly how it happenedAs far as we know that event was unobserved At least no one has admitted
 it   So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability
 strictly speaking are lacking
  

	Can't resist because I've thought about it

	Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis
There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied for
the theory to be accurate such as the hotly discussed topic of
stereoisomerism  Just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice for
all the wonder that would engender because for the theory of
abiogenesis to be accurate the life would have to resemble the best
idea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled

	Comes down to that old question Can we ever really be sure

	But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had been
demonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed on
primordial Earth I would look for the following

	  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earth
	environment

	  ALL contamination sources were eliminated

	  The lifeform produced resembles primitivesimple Earth
	lifeforms

	  The theory accounts for differences in the modern
	Earth environment and primitive Earth environment

NOW if those criteria were satisfied Dr Abio who performed the
experiment would then be in possession of the best candidate for
a theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth  At which point Dr
BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspect
of the theory which doesn't match the early Earth environment or
a characteristic of the new lifeform that doesn't resemble life
on Earth  Were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate the
discrepancies and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims
Dr BBio would then have the best theory
	Never provable  constantly modifiable  progressing ever
closer to the correct answer until the evidence is overwhelming
and even when it is a theory that explains even MORE may take its
place 

	 that's a scientific theory

IMO a Christian has no need of weapons  I know it is very contrary to the
American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms but Christians should rely on
the strength of God to protect them  Note that I say should  We are
inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be
armed to the teeth  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons
to defend himself  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence
For instance I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave
me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night
To jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to the
test  And who are we to test God

God be with you

	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called
DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever

I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
would see stuff coming in from the outside

  Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see how
anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original mass that
formed is forming the black hole in the first place

  Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

As I understand things this is just a matter of perspective If you are
on the outside looking in it appears that nothing can ever enter the
black hole as something approaches the event horizon it appears to slow
and never gets there However if you are on the object looking out you
get an entirely different view As you look out you will see the universe
speed up and ultimately will witness the collapse or heat death of
the universe without

In a previous article mechalasgnecnpurdueedu John P Mechalas says

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans  This may not even be an
accurate statement anyway since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information  We'll have to wait

Yeah we may have to wait till hell freezes over If they had listening
devices in place one would think they would have audiotapes as a result
Why when officials are asked about what those devices picked up do they
stumble around and never answer the question If they have them I think 
people have a right to hear the tapes 

   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say  Their credibility
is shot anyway since they origianlly said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover  We saw how accurate that was

I don't contend that Koresh wasn't a liar That's not really the issue
The issue is did the federal agents use the most prudent measures available
in ending this fiasco that in my opinion was bungled from the
very beginning

   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

I don't know and neither do you unless you were there who started the
fire I hope we find out but I have my doubts

   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves  

Could you please show us this evidence that you have Right now a lot
of people on all sides of this issue are making conflicting statements
right and left Some real live evidence would be most welcome

You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people  All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

In my opinion it is possible that the actions of the FBI a indirectly
b directly but not intentionally or c intentionally I hope not the
latter but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely caused
the fire It is possible that someone inside the community started
the fire because they thought God told them to or because they simply
would rather die than surrender Who knows 

We are left with some compelling questions here besides the above Why
haven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not they
heard shots coming from within the compound once the tank I don't
remember its technical name started ramming down the door It seems
to me that gunshots would be audible at  to  miles away

Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript as they
had promised they would Does the fact that Koresh lied justify the
FBI's lying as well

Will an internal investigation really reveal what happened if in fact
the BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame

How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in the
nowunsealed finally warrant Certainly we won't find out in a
court of law

There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out when
the fire started but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed the
stairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped
Only those in another part of the house escaped

People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came running
out of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather than
going back in When was the last time you had your clothes on fire Who 
the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why I think
the FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically 
btw I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the evil feds 
by any means I simply question the decisions from start to finish
that led to the horrible tragedy of yesterday

And I maintain

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms  And so by
their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bugs
under a rock  However some people but not many will not like the
darkness  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable
These people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded
at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth  And
after a while now that they can see things for what they really are
they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places
they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes


Are you your own master  Do you have any habits that you cannot break
For one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
even the slightest concept of the Bible  Seems that ignorance has you
mastered  How about sexual sins  Gotta any of those secret desires
in your head that you harbor but can get control of   Do you dehumanize
women when they walk past you  Do you degrade them to a sex object in
your head  Are you the master of that kind of thinking  Do you insult
people unknowingly then regret it later  Yet do it again the next
time opportunity presents itself  Are you truly the master of yourself

I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times
That I sometimes say things I do want to say and then repeat my mistake
unwantingly  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect
of my being  There are times I know I shouldn't say something but
then say it anyway  There are times I simply forget a lesson
I in fact am not my own master  I need help  Jesus promised me
this help  And I took him up on his offer  I have willfully let
Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than
I myself do  And why not  Does not the creator know his creation
better than the creation  Does Toyota know what's better for the
Corolla than the Corolla

Do you see my point  I think you're the one under the rock and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism  come and join me  It will be
a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the
long hike but it's well worth it

Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you  Because Brian you enjoy
not having a clue about the Bible   

Don't you see  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness
with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not
something as megapowerful as what you're trying to get me to accept
Surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good
reason to don't you


Can you witness motherly love with your senses  How does caring and
concern for you register with your senses  If nothing registers
to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch
then you better become a Vulcan and fast  You better get rid
of your emotions

And I do have a good reason to believe what I do


When did I say that  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead
of being subject to the whims of a deity but that if the deity
decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am then so be it

The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my
God says   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING  You have
life forever  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal
torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to 
live it in paradise with God  That is what my God says  And that
was the issue  Your madeup theism is what it ismade up  It's
wishful thinking
 
Nope  most people are Christian  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable
place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little
sheep  You enjoy darkness and you're proud of it

Is this the religion of Kendigianism  Most people are not Christian  Most
people including Christians  are not fond of feeling that they
are imperfect  Is the world an undesireable place a doctrine
of Kendigianism  It has nothing to do with my God  Does
Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship
Mine doesn't  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again  
Mine doesn't  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the
priest tells them like good little sheep  Mine doesn't  Is this
a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being 
ignorant of the Bible

Brian following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism
You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible   I don't follow Kendigianism
I follow Christ   Also to try to again show you your ignorance
of Christ and the Bible in regards to priests  have you not read about
the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews  and   Have you not read what the
purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should
NOT be priests today  Yes guess what  The Catholics messed up  I do
not follow Catholicism or any ism  I follow Christ

Nope  You make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your
failures then you die  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments then you've led a
good life

Why would you want to live a good life
To you you die and that's it  Don't contradict yourself  You have
no reason to live a good life  It doesn't do you any good in the
end  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway  So you have no reason to lead a good life Leading
a good life is meaningless   Why do you do such a meaningless thing

I'm sorry I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in
which case it's not really all that important

Has the resurrection sunk in  Jesus is alive  Jesus is NOT dead
Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system
in its every detail  Jesus's death was like a seed  He needed
to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root  Did
you miss the entire John passage as well  


Forget the Bible for a minute  Forget quoting verses forget about
who said what about this or that  Show me  Picture just you and me
and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you're right

Forget that I am a person  Forget that I know how to type  Forget
that I know how to put a sentence together  Forget that I know
how to send email   Forget my existence  Proove to me that I
exist  


Be honest

  I saw one theist on this net talking about the absurdity of one saying he
doesn't believe in god and how can we be sure  The problem with this and
other arguments assumes that the burden of proof lies with the atheist Wrong
In philosophy the one who is making a positive argument must give reasons for
his believing so not the negative  If I were to make the statement elves 
exist then it would be up to me to prove my positive assertion not the 
person saying that elves don't exist  If the negative in this case had to 
prove elves don't exist he would have to omniscient and know every inch of the
universe  The same applies with god  Give me your reasons and you the theist make the case

Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people

Excuse me  WHO destroyed the BD's  Last I knew they burned themselves

   Where did you get this information  The FBI stated they were not
   aware of any mass suicide plans ditto Koresh's attorneys who appeared
   on Larry King's Live yesterday and the survivors claim the fire was started
   from the outside

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans  

    That means that BD's had no plans to commit suecide

                                                        This may not even be an
accurate statement anyway since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information  We'll have to wait

    Are you saying the FBI may have actually received information that BD's were 
    going to burn themselves alive and did not stop the assault  Even if that
    were true you gotta be kidding if you expect them to release that kind of 
    information to the public

   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say  Their credibility
is shot anyway since they origianlly said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover  We saw how accurate that was

    That's not what Koresh's attorney said on Larry King's Live He said
    that Koresh was not going to come out before the Passover and that he and
    his leutenant were working day and night on some kind of religious
    manuscript something about the Seven Seals and that once they finished
    they would come out  K's attorney also said that the day before the
    assault an armored vehicle delivered typewriter supplies to the compound
    and that the FBI promised many times there would not be another attack
    that the matters would be resolved peacefully

   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  

    No they meant that BD's did not set the place on fire

Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

    That was the initial claim but I do not believe it has been repeated
    since  Anyway I'd like to see a tape  The FBI surely videotaped
    the whole operation All conversations must have been recorded too

    How come the two were not shot by the FBI snipers


   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves 

    What evidence

 You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people   All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

    That is what the survivors claim  I'd like to see some evidence
    that people that everyone agrees were not going to commit suecide
    actually did it

would be shot at

Hang on you missed the point entirely they are protesting the lack of
water because it DEPRIVED Koresh of his CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to prove
his DIVINITY by WALKING on it


and the FBIATF go blasting holes into the builing and firing gas munitions

They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

You can tell that the gas did not burn because dispite the fact that
the building was full of it there was no flash of gas flame

 Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
 and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get
 
 Actually after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo and later Carthage
 the Mormons DID fortify Utah  They still arm themselves to defend the
 faith and stockpile food as well  They have been involved in quite a
 lot of illegal activity  including multiple and often underage wives
 for the leaders  a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their
 sect  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking
 
 So what did the Mormons get  It seems that J Edgar Hoover was very
 impressed with the way they kept secrets  They're pledged to defend
 secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood  Many actually
 do  even to the point of suicide  So he hired virtually no one but
 Mormons until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the
 Church of Later Day Saints  Though J Edgar is finally gone the FBI
 personnel especially the field agents are still heavily Mormon
 
 I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment
 of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical

You make some very interesting claims here  I'm not challenging them
mind you but could you provide a reference or two about the makeup
of FBI personnel   Thanks very much

Prove to me that the FBI ATF or the Government in general either burned

mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully a promise that was made
twice by Koresh himself which he broke both times

  Or laws to stop companies from making lookalike FordGM car parts and
selling them as the real thing  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 's cars

Wooa there I have a classic car If I buy a body pannel for  after
being told that it is genuine BL and discover that it is a non original
copy value  I get real pissed If I can get the genuine article I will
pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit probably
meaning that its cheaper overall but it also means that the car is worth
a hell of a lot more

  What I was referring to was not fraud lookalike companies but ones that
made cheap 'GM' etc parts for restoring cars  They were sold as NONname
brand parts but had all of the 'look' so your car would be restored to true
GM and not brand XYZ  As you pointed out they're a lot cheaper so the
not as diehard restorer can afford them too  This is all from what I've
read in automotive magazines over the last few years and apparently the car
companies turned a sympathetic eye because they didn't make the parts anymore

Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for
infringing copyright on parts they don't make I find that very hard to
beleive

 No but is tell me whether or not the following scenario is realistic
 elcheapo companies make and sell 'GM' parts AS GM originals
 GM gets annoyed and lobbies for a bill to stop anyone from labelling
 parts as name brand unless they actually are or pushes for heavier
enforcement of current fraud laws
 Zealous officers raid the previously mentioned small companies mostly
because they didn't have a specific licensing agreement to make the parts
that GM no longer makes

  Pow Instant oppression  Who cares about the intent of the law  It's
the letter that everyone ends up following

There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off

  Perhaps they were remanufacturing parts but then the parts would not
really be exactly namebrand

 quote from me deleted
You should revers that attitude When your interests are threatened its
way too late You have to challenge the govt when it is attacking
someone else's interests 

 I can't say I agree with you more  Perhaps I misphrased myself in my previous
post or you misread what I was trying to say

That does not mean however that you can start calling the govt the 
equivalent of the NAZI party on the basis of an unfortunate outcome
in a hostage situation

   I don't ever remember saying something like that  I may or may not
agree with what the various bureaus did but in the end it was the BD's choice
to blow themselves up and that can never be blamed on overzealous law
enforcement

Jesus allowed himself to be killed  Many of his followers have killed
and died for thier beliefs  Sorry I don't see the difference

I think the subtle difference here is that Koresh took his own life before
he could be prosecuted  Jesus allowed himself to be captured and tried 
and was sentenced to death  That's a big difference whether you're 
Christian or not  That and the fact that the Bible goes on to say that he
arose again on the third day  Now if Koresh manages that one

   The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms At
   least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the
   US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance

Sigh see what our school systems are producing  Total confusion
The original English settlers were probably the most intolerant lot
of people to ever assemble  However the Founding Fathers
Washington Jefferson Madison etc practically made it their
life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy
their great experiment a democratic republic


Pilgrim  Founding forgot the taxonomy for a mo

Jefferson etc were pretty hot on Religious freedom in part because they
were freemasons At the time freemasonry was bing pushed as a sort of
alternative to christianity which was a little out of favour amongst
the intellectuals because of the propensity for religious wars On the
continent the Masons were pretty much a way of denying the Pope's 
authority

Latter on it science came up with an alternative explanation for why
the Universe existed and the intellectual necessity of creating a
creator lessened If you don't have Darwin though Freemasonry is
probably the next best explanation as to the creation of the earth

   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  

    No they meant that BD's did not set the place on fire

According to the latest of CNN reports one BD said they started the fire
themselves and one said the FBI did it  Now given the choise of two
which do you belive  It's hard to answer but add that to the latest
reports again from CNN if I remember correctly that several kersone
containers were inside the compund make me believe the first guy


Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

    That was the initial claim but I do not believe it has been repeated
    since  Anyway I'd like to see a tape  The FBI surely videotaped
    the whole operation All conversations must have been recorded too

Me too  We'll see if it comes up  More info on the listening devices
is coming on CNN nowI can't keep up with all this  Though the FBI
says that they heard no plans of a mass suicide

    How come the two were not shot by the FBI snipers

After the initial fiasco where the ATF went in with guns blazing I seriously
doubt the American public would care much for the assassination of two 
people no matter what they were doing

   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves 

    What evidence

See above  One BD admitted that they started the fires themselves  It's
possible he's lying but I don't see what the BD's would gain from that
It only implicates them more
   Granted it's very weak evidence and everything is going to be in
a different later on  But for now there is more evidence to suggest
that the FBI did not intentionally destroy the BD's which is what the
initial poster claimed  Again as more information becomes available
things may change

 You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people   All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

    That is what the survivors claim  I'd like to see some evidence
    that people that everyone agrees were not going to commit suecide
    actually did it

I'm not sure I understand that last sentancecan you restate it

In article erwintrwacs erwintrwacsfptrwcom Harry Erwin writes
A short comment
As you may recall the early Christians were pacifists preferring to
avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner

The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city
Despite some pious legends the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
especially after centuries of political instability and terror the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology Acts is eerily familiar especially today


	Huh 

	This kind of shotgun blast deserves either to be elaborated upon
or retracted Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the
writer is referring to it should be incumbent on Mr Erwin to back up what
he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two
For example Simon Zealotes  the certain apostle having a nickname
connected to a Jewish terrorist group

	Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to
Christians made above  he is quite silent as to the fate of the Jewish
Christian Church in Jerusalem even though he took the time to
record the death of St James brother of St John On the subject of the
fate of Jesus's family including James the brother of Jesus we learn
nothing from Josephus

	Likewise Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly 
vicious people getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong in
the process But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunity
to learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor under
Domitian we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christians
in either the Histories or the Annals

	The writer's interpretation of Acts is purely subjective as
stated and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspects
of cult psychology are to be found there I can think of a thing or two 
offhand but I'd like to give Mr Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his own
knowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints

	One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday One can argue about
the initial raid but it would be worth mentioning before the facts get
lost that

	 The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	during the initial raid

	 The Branch Davidians opened fire first


   See this is what really bugs me about this whole incident and
   also about Usenet  Here we are almost two months after the original
   raid a raid witnessed by several members of the press and there is 
   STILL no agreement about the basic facts  Riggs here and others
   are claiming that the BD's shot first while others on the net claim
   that the feds did in the form of concussion grenades  

   I suggest that before ANY of you make any claims about who shot 
   first you DOCUMENT your claim with actual evidence and not just
   FOAF or he said  she said     Otherwise don't use words like
   fact above  it just makes you all look stupid


	Perhaps I don't get my news from the right sources Reading
the Washington Post practically every day I had considered the facts
I stated above to be a matter of public record and hardly in dispute
So if others on the net  and in the rest of the media as well are
claiming something else I'll be glad to entertain such claims in an
openminded manner To date this is the first I've seen of any claim 
that the BATF used ANY weapons BEFORE the Branch Davidians opened 
fire on them So  please   enlighten me

I guess my news reader deleted the lines of the th amendment which deal
with noknock warrants  How do you deduce that they are in clear violation
Now maybe noknock warrants SHOULD be illegal  But until the Supreme Court
says so your own pronouncements on the warrant's constitutionality are just
wishful thinking

  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship
  Worship of money is one of the greatest religions in this country
 
 At least I can prove that money exists  Can you say the same for your
 god
 

I have evidence that you will not accept that proves to me that God
exists  I have my personal experiences that have proven to me time
and again that God does exist  My life has not been a bed of roses
and He has been there for me when no one else was around and pulled
me through those times  Of course I know this means nothing to you
because it didn't happen to you  I can't prove to you that God
exists anymore than you can prove that He doesn't

It ultimately boils down to faith  Whether or not you believe in
God is a matter strictly between you and Him  I am just the messenger
I don't judge and I don't condemn you for not accepting God  That is
not my place  You are not my enemy  Satan is our common enemy  And
the only way we can defeat Satan is through Jesus Christ

   Maybe David Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat
   opening epic for a new major religion to me  
  
  NOT  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world
  for a brief moment in time
 
 I see  And what was that guy two thousand years ago who thought he
 was god  Sounds like an egomanic to me  How do you know that Koresh
 wasn't who he claimed


He fulfilled the prophesies told about Him  He performed miracles
You know healing the sick and ressurrecting the dead  Jesus died
and rose from the dead just as He said He would  He preached that
we should love God and love one another as we do ourselves  Jesus
put into practice that which He preached  And He rose from the
dead  His spirit now lives in me  He changed the world not through
the use of a sword that cleaves the flesh but the Word of God that
cleaves us from sin

Compare this to DK who made promises of surrendering and then balked
when his deluded predictions didn't come to pass  In the end he 
chose to kill himself and everyone with him to hide the shame of 
being a false Messiah
 
  Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the FBI
  Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers  Sick and    sad
 
 Jesus allowed himself to be killed  Many of his followers have killed
 and died for thier beliefs  Sorry I don't see the difference


Jesus allowed himself to be killed in order to fulfill prophecy  As
you may recall on the Mount of Olives Jesus prayed to God that if this
fate could have been avoided He would have taken it  But instead
out of love for mankind Jesus chose to accept the agonizing sentence
placed upon Him and thus redeem all mankind  Jesus died to save 
everyone even those who crucifed Him  He's already gone to Hell and
back for you and for me  All He asks is your love

Which followers do you refer to  There have been many who have used
His name to further their own gains  They would have done the same
even if there was no Jesus in the first place  For example Bush 
claimed that God was on their side when they attacked Iraq and Saddam
claimed to have God on his side when he invaded Kuwait  IMO God
would have nothing to do with either side  They were fighting over
oil plain and simple
 
God be with you

    Where did you get this information  The FBI stated they were not
   aware of any mass suicide plans ditto Koresh's attorneys who appeared
   on Larry King's Live yesterday and the survivors claim the fire was started
   from the outside

Actually ONE of the survivors say it was started by the FBI tank knocked over lamp  Another said the Davidians set the fire themselves

The FBI says that one survivor says they set the fire themselves

Given that the claim is that the fire was started in  places at once
and that the building was being rammed by a tank and filled with tear
gas just how did the Davidians manage to coordinate such a thing

stuff about mormons  jews deleted

And as an agnostic who's slightly aware of the Mormon Wars that Casper
describes I'd side with him on this Not that I support the Koreshians nor
                                                              
do I support the Mormons but in a nasty sense the major difference is
this in  the Mormons kicked the US Army's ass In  the
Koreshians died in an inferno Chances are if things had turned out a
 
little differently we might have Koreshians posting to the Net a hundred
                                   
years from now talking about some future analogous event

A little comment here

Please DON't use the term Koreshians when referring to the Branch Davidians
The term Koreshians is already being used  It is the name of a now nonexist
'cult' formed in the early part of this centuary by a Cyrus Reed Teed who
renamed himself 'Koresh'  He formed a religious group called the Koreshian
Unity which believed that the Earth was Hollow  WE lived on the inside  The
were formed in Chicago but left to establish their 'New Jerusalem' in Estero
Florida  The group was fairly successful but soon died out as they believed
in celebacy  The last member died about  years ago

The Koreshian were a pretty intersting group  Today their community is now
a Florida State Historical Site  A local historical group sponsors two 
festivals every year their which coinsides with the cult's two festivals

Sigh I was waiting some some notsointelligent person to bring this
up  Look this is a country of laws To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance

 th Amendment

 papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
 shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon
 probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons

No a noknock warrant is in clear violation of the th amendment
Okay what about the fact that they were tipped off  they shouldn't
have opened fire  right  WRONG  Think about this I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a noknock warrant So
being moronic sheep we wait with our guns holstered Now instead of
the Feds in comes my competition and we're history  The only
acceptable answer to a noknock warrant is blazing guns  I may sound
paranoid but our government is out of control and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it

I assume you are saying that noknock warrants are 'unreasonable' this
is a matter of opinion and is not a CLEAR violation of the th
admendment You say that 'this is a country of laws' yet you seem very
willing to ignore these laws or at least those you disagree with
and respond to a legal situation with 'blazing guns' Like it or not
as it stands now noknock warrants are legal If you don't like this
there are legal means to fight this including contacting your
congresspersons about changing the law and if it happens to you
fighting its legality in court

From article Aprgnecnpurdueedu by mechalasgnecnpurdueedu John P Mechalas
Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people
 
 Excuse me  WHO destroyed the BD's  Last I knew they burned themselves
 Prove to me that the FBI ATF or the Government in general either burned
 the compound themselves or that the BD's had no choice but to commit
 mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully a promise that was made
 twice by Koresh himself which he broke both times

At this point in time we don't who destroyed the BDs  Maybe it was the
government maybe it was Koresh  I wouldn't immediately rule out the
government just because the FBI said that a couple of cult members
torched Koresh's woodframe house  I think that the credibility of the
FBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best at worst they are
baldfaced liers  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that
survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their
woodframe house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the
compound to errupt in flames  Also I have heard that one of the cult
members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire
is no longer claiming that he did it  Moreover he and possibly the
other person may not have even really said that they did it in the
first placewe only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS  I'll believe it when
I hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then

The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire  They
claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
masks  Hmmm  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
agent to me  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black  Note  this
is just speculation on my part  Still it is something to think about
Here's something else to ponder upon  the two agents that were planted
in the compound might have done something to start that fire  I don't
know if they did it deliberately or notif they did at allbut I
would like to see statements from these two agents on the events that
transpired during that day  I think that they would be rather
enlightening don't you think  They were inside the compound so they
ought to have a real good idea of what went on in there  Of course if
they did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would be
very forthcoming with any information

The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in the
compound  They may have said this so that people might be more
likely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire  However
consider that if the FBI did lightup that house would they admit to
it  I think not  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue if
people discovered that the FBI killed  people  Obviously the FBI
would do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDs
started the fire  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house
fires burning in more than one location in a house isn't inconsistent
with a house fire  The tear gas cannisterswhich do produce heat
despite what you may have been told by the mediamay have contributed
to starting the blaze  Also it was very windy on the day of the
fire  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts of
the house that weren't already on fire  Like I said the verdict isn't
in yet  The FBI may very well be guilty of a holocaust

  The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms At
  least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the
  US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance

Maybe I should take Phill out of my kill file it looks like his rantings
are starting to get amusing

Phill once again you are demonstrating your extreme ignorance  The founding
fathers were for the most part born in the area that was to become the US
They did not leave anywhere to come here

I assume you are saying that noknock warrants are 'unreasonable' this
is a matter of opinion and is not a CLEAR violation of the th
admendment You say that 'this is a country of laws' yet you seem very
willing to ignore these laws or at least those you disagree with
and respond to a legal situation with 'blazing guns' Like it or not
as it stands now noknock warrants are legal If you don't like this
there are legal means to fight this including contacting your
congresspersons about changing the law and if it happens to you
fighting its legality in court

If an unreasonable warrant is served in the 'knock' fashion I can see
the warrant claim it is unreasonable allow the search and hire a
lawyer to have the evidence suppressed

If any warrant is served in the 'noknock' fashion all I
see is men with guns bashing in the door  Maybe they've got POLICE
or ATF jackets maybe they yell Police  But ANYONE can do that
with little effort Even if I have time to take in all this if I
decide they are police and fail to defend myself my decision could easily
be fatal

More likely I can't see the jackets before I have to decide whether to
defend myself or not and they yell as they are bashing in the door
so I can't hear them  Or they've already thrown in some flashbang
grenades deafening and confusing me

    The FBI claims on the basis of their intelligence reports
    that BD's had no plans to commit suecide  They btw had bugged the 
    place and were listening to BD's conversations till the very end

    Koresh's attorney claims that based on some  hours he spent
    talking to his client and others in the compound he saw no
    indication that BD's were contemplating suecide

    The survivors claim it was not a suecide

It's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim  It is
clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that
BD members had started the fire

    BD's were not contemplating suecide and there is no reason 
    to believe they committed one

No reason  How about these two

  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the
	corridors and set fire to it  The speed at which the fire spread
	is not inconsistent with this claim

  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound
	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this
	fire  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did

  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide it is very possible that
	David Koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this
	was not suicide  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort

There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction

A  They are not dead but escaped via bunkeretc  From reports of the
	inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found I would rate this
	as highly unlikely

B  The fire was started by an FBI accident  This is possible but it would be
	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it
	Sure it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
	which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
	the day near the edge of the complex  It's anecdotal evidence that
	has been contradicted by other escapees

C  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI  This has been suggested by
	some on the NET and I would rate this possibility as utterly
	ludicrous  This is what we in sciskeptic would call an
	extraordinary claim and won't bother refuting unless someone gives
	any good evidence to back it up

So we are left with two reasonable possibilities  That the fire was an FBI
accident and that the fire was started by the BD  I find the latter more
likely based on the evidence I've seen so far

At this point in time we don't who destroyed the BDs  Maybe it was the
government maybe it was Koresh  I wouldn't immediately rule out the
government just because the FBI said that a couple of cult members
torched Koresh's woodframe house  I think that the credibility of the
FBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best at worst they are
baldfaced liers

So you say the credibility of the FBI and ATF is questionalbe  So be it
But certainly the credibility of David Koresh was when he was alive
absolutely untrustworthy  The BD's in the compound were by all accounts
absolutely loyal to Koresh and thus would lie for him  Thus the
credibility of his followers must be questionned  Do you trust them more
than the police

  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that
survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their
woodframe house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the
compound to errupt in flames  Also I have heard that one of the cult
members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire
is no longer claiming that he did it  Moreover he and possibly the
other person may not have even really said that they did it in the
first placewe only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS  I'll believe it when
I hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then

No I saw one of the escapees say it himself on television  That was on the
 o'clock News on channel  here in the Bay Area

The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire  They
claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
masks  Hmmm  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
agent to me  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black  Note  this
is just speculation on my part  Still it is something to think about
Here's something else to ponder upon  the two agents that were planted
in the compound might have done something to start that fire  I don't
know if they did it deliberately or notif they did at allbut I
would like to see statements from these two agents on the events that
transpired during that day  I think that they would be rather
enlightening don't you think  They were inside the compound so they
ought to have a real good idea of what went on in there  Of course if
they did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would be
very forthcoming with any information

You are speculating that the FBI purposely started the fire  Please
if you've got such a ridiculously extraordinary claim and have no evidence
whatsoever at least give us a speculatory reason why the FBI would want to
do such a thing

The possibility that the fire was started accidentally is much more reasonable
but we don't have anything but contradictory anecdotal evidence right now

 	All you BD apologists seem to be conveniently forgetting
 Jonestown  It would have looked much worse if the feds had just
 waited till they all committed suicide  This was a no win situation
 although the final raid was a tragic failure  they should have
 been able to get more people out alive
 
	BD apologists

	Give me a break

	Yes BD apologists  There have been a number of posts defending
the BD's as some persecuted religous minority which is sheer bunk
Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term cult etc
but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff
It was a weapons raid  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's 
religion but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic 
weapons is a threat  This goes for neoNazis and other nonreligous groups
	So I have this question If your religious group isn't stockpiling
automatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity why is this
event a blow to religious freedom 

Mike

PS The analogy between BD's and Jews of the Holocaust is so insulting
and mindnumbingly stupid I won't even touch it with a ten foot pole

PPS Stop with the paranoid fantasies about the US goverment gunning you
down just because of your religous beliefs  Trust me nobody cares

	Let me get this straight your theory is that the FBI 
accidentally started the fire while the ATF was deliberately starting 
it  That would certainly explain why they've been lying about the 
whole thing  that kind of screwup really would be embarrassing 
wouldn't it  There is of course only one weak spot in this theory  
we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were 
wearing black and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists 
of baldfaced liars  From this we can immediately conclude that 
they were not in fact wearing black and that that description was 
part of the FBI coverup  Who was it really  Come on now think  
who is really out to embarrass the Clinton administration  The 
answer is so obvious I don't see how you could have missed it  
That's right  it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans 
of course  And it worked too Clinton immediately backed down on 
the stimulus package didn't he

Still it is something to think about

Uh huh  

Later he writes
 The tear gas cannisterswhich do produce heat
despite what you may have been told by the mediamay have contributed
to starting the blaze  

	Now I'm getting confused  Did the tear gas canisters start 
the fire before or after the lantern and when was that in relation to 
when the ATF started it  Oh by the way the story I've been hearing 
is that no canisters were used since they didn't want to start 
a fire but we of course only have their word on that

	As you may be able to tell I'm not exactly persuaded

PS  The title for this thread is ridiculous  Feds couldn't give a hoot
about their religous ideas  weapons was the problem  Similar situations
have popped up with those I'm not gonna pay taxes freaks in Idaho etc 
where religion clearly has no bearing  Religous freedom here as an issue
is a complete smokescreen

  Exactly  What would happen if I barracade myself in my house for a
while with lots of firearms  Then when the police come with a search
warrent first I slam the door in their face then shoot at them when
they try to enter  After this I shoot at people who try to get me
to come out  This sort of thing happens every now and then and it
usually ends up being a shootout between the police and the persons
behind the barricade  Why are the Branch Davidians any different

If Jesus never taught the concept of the Trinity how do you deal with the 
following   

   Mat   Then Jesus came to them and said All authority in heaven
   and on earth has been given to me

   Mat   Therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing

     We are talking about origins not merely science   Science cannot
     explain origins  For a person to exclude anything but science from
     the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
     than science 

 This is a false premise

In what manner  If you argue that the universe was created with a higher
truth than science btw I would love to see you define truth in this
arguement then you must state how you know this and what it is  To subbornly
state that there is a higher truth and that it isyour god I would ask you to prove it
This obviously you cannot do  Besides if I assume for the moment that
there is a 'higher truth' then how can you prove it is your god and not 
another religion's  What makes you so arrogant to push forward your idea
of creation over many peoples' study of the laws of nature ie science

Science is the study of nature  It is openminded if the theory doesn't fit the
facts then trash the theory and try to construct one which does  It is flexible
Your definition of science presupposes that science ignores this god 
character altogether  If this is so then it is only because no evidence 
can be found of him

  By the way I enjoy science

So do I  Fortunately I am not mentally shackled into constructing my
scientific conclusions by placing god Jesus and the holy ghost into every
paragraph in a sycophantic manner

     It is truly a wonder observing God's creation  Macroevolution is
     a mixture of  percent science and  percent religion guaranteed
     within three percent error  
 


Indeed it is a wonder observing the random effects of creation  This of
course assumes a definition of aethetics which you don't forward


As to Macroevolution  please give references and more information  From
where do you get your figures

Is it not the case that in the eyes of the law when someone is aware of
something and has the capability of taking action and does not that individual
may be held responsible for that action

Example the driver of a getaway car may be held as an accomplice to murder
	 The I didn't know defense spawned the ignorance of the law is no excuse

When an individual is held as a material witness to a crime is there a criminal
charge against the individual  If not on what grounds is the person imprisoned

at it It is either heads or tails It is entirely possible
for me to simply choose to believe that it is heads or tails and
be right Now there is a procedure for ensuringmore or less
that my belief will be correct but it is quite possible for me
to be correct without following it

 You have to pick 
the right procedure and note its importance  You've got to value it
No I don't I can do perfectly good science without valuing
the procedure But you're just overloading the term value
again Judgement of the validity of a procedure is not the
same as judgement of how preferable a certain action is and
just because the word value can be applied to both doesn't
make it so You might as well assert that number theory is
based on values

Otherwise you don't care about actual truth and shouldn't object
to the statement objectivism is true
Huh This is a complete non sequiter

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively
You're just overloading the word value AGAIN I suspect

   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively then we are using a maybenotquitesure
method on maybenotquitesure observations  That should lead
to maybenotquitesure results no  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable
I don't understand your point here What do you mean by not quitesure
observations It gets observed all the time that if you don't
buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is
done the results become meaningless 

If you're suggesting that because science is allegedly chosen
'subjectively' the results have to be inconsistent that's
silly

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not
OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in any 
important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   DES
does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either
This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which
accepts  bytes and uses the first  to ECB the second 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics

  Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people
  of the US collectively  for all of the land in America would that 
  sound like a good deal  
 
  Well that would depend on how much we wanted the US and how much
  we wanted the  wouldn't it
 
 Yes it would  Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality

Suppose Xist saucers land  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo
 on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children  Then a
bunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the Xists in return
for one dollar  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden during
the purge

Get the point  None of these events are inherently impossible  So it is
not the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality

For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant
consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation

You are with a bunch of friends  You have a  bill  You offer to sell the
 bill to the highest bidder  subject to the restriction that you also
get to take the money bid by the secondhighest bidder

Try it  You'll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than 
for your  bill

In article qbjdusenetINSCWRUEdu cjclevelandFreenetEdu John W Redelfs writes

I learned that God loves his children who have never heard of him and has a
plan for redeeming them too even those who have died without a knowledge
of Christ  I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on
his death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse  It
requires faith in Christ proven by following him by keeping his
commandments  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed

So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross

Paradise and salvation are not the same thing  Salvation is better  Refer

     Just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing You refer to
     differing interpretations of create and say that many Christians may
     not agree So what That is really irrelevant We do not base our faith
     on how many people think one way or another do we The bottom line is
     truth regardless of popularity of opinions

   I'm sorry I thought we were discussing heresy  I assumed that heresy
meant a departure from orthodoxy in which case generally accepted belief is
indeed an important issue  In this case the definition of the word create
is of great importance since creation is the issue being discussed


     Also I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
     and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the Mormon
     belief You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
     have been addressed In order to reply to the issue you have to address
     and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the
     conclusion that you grant

  I should have said given the Mormon belief  If you disagree with the
Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally
existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation then that is the important
point

     The Bible states that Lucifer was created  The Bible states that Jesus
     is the creator of all The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
     belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same

  Correction you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by
such terms

     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God Literally There is
     nothing symbolic about it This however contradicts what the Bible
     says The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God

   It always cracks me up when antiMormons presume to tell Mormons what they
believe  Mormons do in fact believe that all people including Christ and
Lucifer are children of God in the sense that we were all created or
organized or whatever by Him  We also believe that being offspring of
God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually born again of
Him  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings  This is
how language works Robert and it's why making someone an offender for a
word is dangerous


     This is really a red herring It doesn't address any issue raised but
     rather it seeks to obfuscate The fact that some groups try to read
     something into the Bible doesn't change what the Bible teaches For

     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches To discount or not
     even address what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that
     have differing views is selfdefeating To see what the Bible teaches
     you have to look at the Bible

   On the contrary Robert it is not a red herring at all to show that those
who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says  You say
that one must simply look at the Bible to see what it teaches but centuries
of people doing just that have shown that no one is really sure what it says
Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the
scriptures

     I find this rather curious When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is
     that Jesus needed to be saved I put forward some quotes from the late
     apostle Bruce McConkie The curious part is that no one addressed the
     issue of Jesus needing to be saved' Rick comes the closest with his I
     have my own conclusions to addressing the point

  Let me clarify this one more time  You did not refer to the Mormon belief
that Jesus needed to be saved but rather to McConkie's belief in same  We
keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of
Mormon doctrine and you keep ignoring it see below


     Most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of
     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine' I don't
     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon That is not the
     issue  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
     subject is the real issue The indication from Rick is that they may
     certainly be

  On the contrary Robert if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon
canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of great
importance  The fact is that they are not  Whether or not they indicate
general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large
number of Mormons

Perhaps you don't get it and maybe you never will  Many didn't get it in the
Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands
in witch hunts and inquisitions

There were many injustices in the middle ages  And this is truely sad
I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured
them for practicing homosexuality or any other crime  The church is not
called to take over the governments of the world  It may be that homosexuals
treated cruelly today but that does not mean that we should teach 
Christians to practice homosexual immorality  Do you think that we should
also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because
the witches in the middle ages were persecuted


The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the
final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr Hudson is that YOU have a
conditional love for gays  Condition  Change and we'll love you This is
sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an unconditional
love one that calls people just as they are

And you accuse me of judging  When did you look into my heart and see
if I have love  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians
to practice homosexual immorality and you pretend to have divine knowledge
to look into my heart  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should
I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either  I don't know
very many homosexuals as it is  

But Jesus loves homosexuals just as He loves everyone else  If His love
were conditional I not know Him at all  Yes  We should show love to 
homosexuals but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to 
stumble and continue in their sin  That is a very damaging and dangerous 
thing

The results of the passing amendment in
Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over
Colorado called STRAIGHT I forget the whole definition off hand
but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash and their motto
is Working for a fagfree America with an implicit advocation for violence

This is sick and it seems to be what you and Mr Hudson and others are
embracing

That is slander   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able
to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of
the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality
as normal and that this is what you are embracing  I do believe
that homosexual sex is immoral that does not mean I endorse using violence
against them  There is a problem of hatred in the church  But there
is also the problem of what has been called unsanctified mercy
Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in 
this country and the storm on the horizon and have gotten militant in 
the flesh  This is truely sad  Yet others in other churches have 
embraced immorality in society and have pointed to the carnality in the
conservative churches to justify their actions  

Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people
to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away

Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus
But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in  Jesus didn't
go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects
to draw people in  He told one man to sell all He had  He told
another not to say good bye to His family  His words were hard at times
We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them
to begin construction  many people have already been innoculated to the
gospel

If some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok I 
would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still wrong  My 
basis of morality is not on societal norms or on current legalities  My basis
is surprise surprise on both the Bible and on inherent moral abhorrences for
lack of a better way to put it to certain things  Yes that's vague and the
only way I know off the top of my head to defend it is to say that all humans 
are similarly made Yes that falls into the trap of creation and why follow 
the Bible  My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust goodness 
love respect courage and honesty in any society rather than deceipt hatred
disrespect cowardness and dishonesty  No I haven't been everywhere and

That's right  it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans

I'm one of those people who does not know what the word objective means 
when put next to the word morality  I assume its an idiom and cannot
be defined by its separate terms

Give it a try

Objective morality is morality built from objective values

Well that got us a long way Now define objective value and
make sure that you are referring to moral not scientific values

While your at it take a look at the definition of objective and
values If you don't have a dictionary I've written those definitons
in a couple of recent postings

For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
Jim and I Jim wrote the following to me in email after I pointed out
that he Jim had taken a quote out of context
In trm Robert Weiss writes a promise from Psalm 
Gee since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical you must be really
busy arguing against these outofcontext extracted translations

He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy again based on a lack of
response to an article by Robert Weiss toward Stephen

I pointed out that I did in fact agree that both Robert Weiss and
Jim Meritt took quotes out of context  Hence I find it difficult to
understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite  Needless to say I don't
have time to reply to every article on trm that takes a quote
out of context  

I asked Jim the following
So according to you Jim the only way to criticize one person for
taking a quote out of context without being a hypocrite is to post a
response to every person on trm who takes a quote out of context

Jim replied by saying 
Did I either ask or assert that

But today we find four articles from Jim one of which has the subject
Silence is concurrence  

mmwunixmitreorg James Meritt writes
Is it not the case that in the eyes of the law when someone is aware of
something and has the capability of taking action and does not that individual
may be held responsible for that action

Which is of course a complete red herring  Taking quotes out of
context isn't a crime  I don't have time to read every article on
trm and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all

Does silence is concurrence imply that Jim thinks that because I
didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes
out of context  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
question read what he has written and decide for yourself


But back to the context of my conversation with Jim  Jim's next 
gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
concluded that I was being a hypocrite  I challenged him to provide
the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion
Today we find another obscure article posting it twice didn't help
make it more clear Jim titled Inductive Logic

Scenario
A white goose waddles past the door
A white goose waddles past the door
A white goose waddles past the door
 repeat an uncountably large number of times
A black goose waddles past the door  An individual hits it with an axe

 Given that the population of geese is uncountably large and the size of the
   confidence interval for the decision is undetermined under what conditions
   could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese
   be made

 If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed is it not a valid question 
   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese

More red herrings  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
number of my articles  Could Jim mean that because I axed his articles
but not Weiss' articles he wants to conclude inductively 
Well I can't see where he is going with this

But I can help him with his induction  I've written roughly 
articles since January  The vast majority of them are discussions with
Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists where I take the position that
they are making bad arguments  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt
where I take the position that he is making bad arguments a straw man
argument earlier and taking quotes out of context more recently

Think hard about this Jim  See the pattern  Think harder  Run it
through your induction engine and see what pops out

I addressed most of the key issues in this very long  lines post
by Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday  The first was made into the
title post of a new thread Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally ironyimpaired
and the second more serious one appeared along the thread

A Chaney Post and a Challenge reissued and revised

both only in talkabortion but I am posting its contents into
talkreligionmisc as soon as I exit here

This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so  The
second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us
The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as 
KaflowitzDebatingPoints tm which he continues to rack up on both
talkabortion and talkreligionmisc while setting followups to 
talkabortion alone  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that
he gets a prompt as to where to set followups and does not follow
talkreligionmisc much this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not
also setting his Newsgroups line to talkabortion alone

  perhaps out
 of dedication to your convictions I never never thought that you
 would be consciously intellectually dishonest though
 
 I am not  Can you show me anything that would lead you to think 
 otherwise

See the Spreading Christianity thread in which he says I
ignore certain statements that I specifically acknowledged and

Dean did not  He called them the Great Commission but this is NOT
descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt 

Matt  Jerusalem Bible translation

	And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have
	to say as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust
	from your feet

Matt 

 	I tell you solemnly on the day of Judgment it will not 
 	go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with 
 	that town

In the post to which Dean is referring above I said

 The above is a good description of Kaflowitz who keeps harping on
  shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next
                                   

The highlighted words refer to Matt  and  respectively

And Dean countered

Actually this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an
intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are since I
specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty
to spread the word  In fact it is the combination of the two
statements I was addressing and not just the one and for you to
characterize that as ignoring the instruction to spread the
word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are

Of course Matt  quoted above makes no mention of instruction
to spread the word

All these quotes btw are from

MessageID Aprcbnewsjcbattcom

in which at the end he claims I did not answer a question
which I answered and which he deleted to get the chronology
right he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer

And I claim it correctly because my question went

Do you too measure
the goodness of a post by its entertainment value and care not
a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood

and the closest Dean came to an answer was

Peter Peter Peter  You're just so stupid pretentious dull
and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that
the sport is all there is

Of course this does NOT answer my question which has to do with posts
in GENERAL and not my posts in particular  Surely even Dean knows this
yet he brazenly asserts otherwise reinforcing his claim with an insult

So I now restore the answer to your question
that you deleted  If you're still unable to figure it out ask
a nice kid at the local junior high to help you  It really
doesn't take much sophistication to understand

On top of which I doubt that the answer is at all representative
of Dean's true frame of mind  The insults you have seen quoted thus
far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's 
mind throughout the line post from which these quotes were taken
One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all
this

He even dredges up a falsified account of
events that transpired earlier on another thread

You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it
				
was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of

the sins of other individuals


False  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins
That I made public announcements of the sins of others
sins BTW that were a matter of public record documented in
the posts of others is a different matter

Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that
they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins so
I pointed some of them out  And I expressly set up a whole thread
YOUR TURN to let people point out MY sins to me

Dean again

You made an ass of yourself
by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was
somehow an attempt to paint Jews as plaster saints thereby
revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well
as showing your dislike for people saying positive things
about Jews and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by
repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made and then
claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge

Actually what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew
who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite
according to Jewish customs  In doing so he was caricaturing
Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding as well as
implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity

I went very easily on Dean for this giving him the benefit of
the doubt in a post following my initial crack about plaster saints 
suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording

In an astonishing act of ingratitude Dean now serves up an incredibly
distorted picture of what took place between us and using it as
the basis of one insult after another

 Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus
 But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in 

Very well put  And in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian
brother yet continues in his sin and claims that his sin is not a sin at 
all but perfectly acceptable what should be done  Should Christians 
just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person  By 
reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible are 
they using a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus 

Frankly I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to 
pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other 
Christians accept his chastisement better a lot more serious than 
people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin

                             THE DIVINE MASTERS       
      
               Most Christians would agree and correctly so that 
          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master and a projection of God 
          into the physical world God Incarnate 
          
               But there are some very important related facts that 
          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of as are followers of 
          most other world religions 
           
               First Jesus Christ was NOT unique John  NOTWITH
          STANDING  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master 
          God Incarnate PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES 
          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY both before and 
          after the life of Jesus 
    
               The followers of some of these Masters founded the 
          world's major religions usually PERVERTING the teachings of 
          their Master in the process  Christians for example added 
          THREATS of ETERNAL DAMNATION in Hell and DELETED the 
          teaching of REincarnation 
       
               Secondly and more importantly after a particular 
          Master physically dies and leaves this world there is 
          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively 
          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY 
          alive  THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE 
          UNIVERSES                             

               Therefore all those Christians who worship Jesus and 
          pray to Jesus and expect Jesus to return and save them from 
          their sins are only KIDDING THEMSELVES and have allowed 
          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly 
          MANUFACTURED by the Romans 
      
               And emotional feelings are a TOTALLY DECEIVING 
          indicator for religious validity 
    
               These things are similarly true for followers of most 
          other major world religions including Islam 
     
               Thirdly the primary function of each Master is to tune 
          His Initiates into the AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM or SOUND 
          CURRENT referred to as THE WORD in John  and as 
          The River of Life in Revelation  and to personally 
          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they 
          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a 
          silver cord 
    
               True Salvation which completes a Soul's cycles of 
          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes is achieved 
          only by reaching at least the SOUL PLANE which is five 
          levels or universes above the physical universe and this 
          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLYLiving Divine 
          Master 
    
               One such Divine Master alive today is an American Sri 
          Harold Klemp the Living Eck Master or Mahanta for the 
          Eckankar organization now headquartered in Minneapolis 
          PO Box   zip  
    
               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji now 
          living in Punjab India and is associated with the Sant 
          Mat organization 
      
               One of the classic books on this subject is THE PATH OF 
          THE MASTERS Radha Soami Books PO Box  Gardena CA  
           written in  by Dr Julian Johnson a theologian 
          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India 
          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of 
          that time Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji 
    
               Several of the Eckankar books including some authored 
          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp can be found in 
          most public and university libraries and some book stores or 
          obtained thru interlibrary loan  The book ECKANKARTHE 
          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS by Sri Paul Twitchell is ANOTHER 
          classic 
    
               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with 
          the AntiChrist which is or was to be a temporary world 
          dictator during the socalled last days  But the Masters 
          don't ever rule even when asked or expected to do so as 
          Jesus was 
    
               People who continue following Christianity Islam or 
          other orthodox religions with a physicallyDEAD Master will 
          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation between the 
          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world until they 
          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLYLIVING Divine 
          Master 
    
          
    
          REINCARNATION
          
               The book HERE AND HEREAFTER by Ruth Montgomery 
          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation 
          as a FACT OF LIFE including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past 
          lives about  accurate the subconscious mind sometimes 
          makes things up especially with a bad hypnotist 
          SPONTANEOUS RECALL especially by young children some of 
          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives 
          homes possessions etc DREAM RECALL of past life experi
          ences DEJA VU familiarity with a far off land while travel
          ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read
          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 
          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew  John the 
          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias and John  How 
          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born unless he LIVED 
          BEFORE   ALWAYS use the KING JAMES VERSION  Later 
          versions are PERVERSIONS  
          
               Strong INTERESTS innate TALENTS strong PHOBIAS etc 
          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES  For example 
          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually 
          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE  
          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to 
          another person being met for the first time in THIS life 
          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS 
          INCARNATION 

               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF 
          KARMA Galatians  Revelation  etc  People would 
          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their 
          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the 
          future or in a FUTURE INCARNATION 



          nd COMINGS

               If a Divine Master physically dies translates 
          before a particular Initiate of His does then when that 
          Initiate physically dies translates the Master will meet 
          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul 
          Plane  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a nd 
          Coming  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience NOT something that 
          happens for everyone all at once  People who are still 
          waiting for Jesus' nd Coming are WAITING IN VAIN 
    
          
          
          PLANES OF EXISTENCE

               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN 
          major levels of existence  Above the Physical Plane is the 
          Astral Plane the Causal Plane the Mental Plane the Etheric 
          Plane often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane 
          the Soul Plane and several higher Spiritual Planes  The 
          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN counting upward from 
          the Physical  The planes between but NOT including the 
          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes 
    
               It is likely that ESP telepathy astrological 
          influences radionic effects biological transmutations See 
          the  book with that title and other phenomena without 
          an apparent physical origin result from INTERACTIONS between 
          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane 
    
               The major planes are also SUBDIVIDED  For example a 
          subplane of the Astral Plane is called Hades and the 
          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it created there 
          LESS THAN  YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some 
          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a 
          THREATENING manner  The Christian Heaven is located 
          elsewhere on the Astral Plane  Good Christians will go there 
          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth 
          
          
          
          SOUND CURRENT vs BLIND FAITH

               The Christian religion demands of its followers an 
          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more 
          than GOOD FEELING which is TOTALLY DECEIVING 
       
               If a person is not HEARING some form of the SOUND 
          CURRENT THE WORD THE BANI THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM 
          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL 
          CONTINUE 
    
               The SOUND CURRENT manifests differently for different 
          Initiates and can sound like a rushing wind ocean waves on 
          the sea shore buzzing bees higherpitched buzzing sound a 
          flute various heavenly music or other sounds  In Eckankar 
          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as 
          a Member  This and other experiences such as SOUL TRAVEL 
          REPLACE blind faith

 If there is a God as described by the Christians for instance then
 He has existence apart from and independent of humankind His
 existence is outside of our frame of reference reality

Thus god does not really exist How true This claim would
lend substantial support to the notion that religions are actually
seamless virtual realities

Does god exist or not To us this question is a true dichotomy

Can god know a reason for her existence If she is omniscient then
she must know this There is a philosophical problem whether anything
can exist without a time frame  for instance if it were possible to
observe our universe from 'outside' in the neverness surrounding
this universe it would never have existed 

Thus we are faced with a trilemma

 God 'metaexists' and from this metaexisting perspective she
created existence the Universe and everything 

This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing which
is precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis Lizhi  Shuxian 
Creation of the Universe say This 'nothingness' is not empty enough
it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence
until there is no 'when' yet but never mind god the source of
all existence started to play I fail to see the difference between
these two forms of nothingness though If there isn't one it might
be god is not necessary for creation

It is obvious that the levels of 'metaexistence' are not necessarily
limited to god there might be a 'metagod' on some other level

 God exists and has always existed she has a timescale which
is different from our own This sounds sensible but it is difficult
to conceive how she could know why she exists  a being which
has always existed and is infinitely conscious of itself can
remember that she has always been the same and perhaps know herself
completely but she cannot know why she exists and how she knows
everything she knows Would a knowledge of how a being with a 
personality a subjective viewpoint knows everything be this
being's knowledge A conscious being conscious of everything is
actually a contradiction in terms  it means that god is only
conscious of herself since we and the whole universe are
already incorporated in her mental models thoroughly modelled
Actually a conscious being conscious of only itself is not
conscious at all 

 God is herself the Existence This is nothing more than an Orwellian
redefinition of the word existence A logical consequence of this
statement is that god is actually all existence I think this is
also called a form of pantheism

 If this
 being declares a thing to be so it is necessarily so since He has
 defined Himself as omnipotent and if His claims are to be believed
 He is at least omnipotent relative to us God is intrinsically
 selfdefined and all reality is whatever He says it is  in an
 objective sense

In a reality god is supposed to have created I cannot believe in
her is that my fault or the creator's fault God gave me freedom
of choice but nevertheless knows what I will opt for is it fair
play on her side

If god has a conscious mind in any sense she has a point of view
I'd say she is entitled to her opinions about me but I still insist
that any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with 
resistance and disapproval 

 If God determines a standard of conduct that standard is objective

No an objective standard means something independent on any
subjective viewpoint including god's point of view 

 If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
 standard while permitted to ignore it they substitute a relative
 morality or mode of conduct giving the term morality a nebulous
 meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
 misunderstand The standard is objective and the conduct required to
 meet that standard is therefore objectively determined

What standard My morality and my conscience  disagrees with the
'standards' of the Bible Which one to ignore How to interpret
any divine standard There is a great discrepancy even among 
Christians on this For instance the Bible does not condemn
female homosexuality  why many Christians do thinking god doesn't
accept it anyway

Bill to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make the
term nebulous Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour
something we can change and something that must change when
societies change It might be some basic concepts are hardwired
in our brains by evolution but in the end we must decide ourselves
I don't think people need religion to keep them moral 
thinking goes beyond threat of punishment 

 Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
 infinitely malleable doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
 doesn't exist Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
 norm or the preferred conduct of decent people making it seem
 subjective but it is derived from an absolute objective standard

I've yet to see an objective standard that is 

a universally applicable today and tomorrow
b universally acceptable not against our own concepts of what is
moral and what isn't

 Ironically this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
 nature according to Christianity at least yet is condemned as being
 contrary to human nre oppressive and severe This may be due as
 much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself but like it
 or not it's there

I don't think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard
although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time
and much of it is still applicable The problem is that I can't
agree with it all This is not a question of comforting my
conscience with a thought that I won't be responsible with what
I do as Christians would put it My conscience is in an irreconcilable
conflict with the Bible on homosexuality Paul's idea of women's
role in marriage etc and the whole idea that I should believe
in someone I got no help from in this task

parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

Ok one last time  yeah right  In order for you to not pay for any
abortions through your tax money everyone would have to not pay for
any abortions through tax money

Ok one last time  yeah right

Many who oppose federal funding for abortions would be quite happy
simply to specify that their tax money not be used to support programs
to which they morally object  Failing that the House Ways and Means
Committee has so far rejected similar proposals their only recourse
is to object to the program itself  This they do but you don't seem
to like that  What other choice do you offer  You suggest they
should not consider how portions of their individual tax money are
spent  Why not

Suppose you had the option to specify that your tax money can't pay for
abortions  Do you think that that should entitle you to pay less taxes
Since refusing to fund abortions would lead to an even larger increase in
funding for prenatal care and delivery if anything you should pay more
taxes  Suppose we let your taxes stay at the same level

Do you really think that funding for abortion would be reduced  No your
taxes would go towards other things and more taxes from those who don't
object to paying for abortion would be moved from those other things to
pay for abortions  All that happens is that the funds get shuffled around
to give you a clear conscience  Why put the government through all that
paperwork when the end result is no different  Why worry about it when
it makes no difference and it doesn't hurt you in the least

Your advice

     People should stop worrying about where their individual money is
     going and instead vote for how government should spend all
     the money it gets  Currently the dulyelected president proposes
     that federal medical programs include abortions in their coverage
     If the dulyelected Congress goes along with it well there you
     gothat is how our system of representation works
     Parenthetical comments removed

is similar to the horrible advice some offer potential rape victims
It's going to happen anyway so you might as well just lie back and
enjoy it

That is the most rediculous outofcontext analogy I have every heard  I
do not advocate any such advice  There is quite a difference between
the illegal violation called rape and the constitutionally granted power
of taxation along with the funding of legal procedures  If you can't see
the difference you can go to hell

Care to respond this time Mr Parker

The following challenges remain unmet by Mr Parker  From his own
comments we are left to presume they were too much for him

Your yanking followups to posts of mine from other threads does not
demonstrate any deliberate lack of response on my part  There is a great
deal of bandwidth on talkabortion and it can take a long time to get
through to the followups to articles I have posted and many times responses
expire before I get to reading them

It is pretty fucking arrogant of you to pull copies here and demand that
I respond to them here when they were posted already and quite possibly
responded to separately  I believe I have indeed responded to some of
the following previouslythough probably not each of them



parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

By the way thanks so much for deleting the context of this next line in
your followup to it

No I have some objective nonreligious reasons with justification for
why personity makes an appropriate value system 

Please define personity and enumerate the reasons which justify it
as an appropriate value system

I have done so in the past  It isn't my fault that you never saw it

Here is a brief explanation

A person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights
of another person  If you want to hear more about this aspect of personity
go read the thread Why is bodily autonomy so important on talkabortion
You may have to look at all unexpired posts on that thread to find the post
where I give a fairly detailed explanation  I believe it was posted on
April  or 

The second part is a definition of a person  A simplistic explanation is
that a person is a member of society  Most normal adult human beings are
good examples of people  Most children over two years old are people as
well  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation
with them  It is actually more complicated than that but I have no desire
to spend the time it would take to explain it to you  Read the thread Why
is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification



parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

If the government refused
to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then
it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose
mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby
will also require care for  years

Have you statistics that demonstrate the majority of the population
has no qualm with government funding for abortions  I suspect you
fail to account for the position of the person who wishes abortion
neither banned nor federally funded

Actually I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not
those who object to federal funding  I admit I did not say it very
clearly and apologize for that

Do you have statistics that might answer this question  Or are you just
blowing smoke

A Prochoice president  of  who ran was elected  That means the
country basically supports the choice to have an abortion 

Surely you don't wish to suggest the recent presidential election was
nothing more than a nationwide referendum on the abortion issue

I said what I said  If you had not deleted most of it everyone could
see for themselves what I said

To refuse to fund abortions  is to remove that choice from some
women and add the additional burden to society for no reason

Are we simply to take it on your authority that there is no reason

If you disagree then give us some reasons  Given that abortion is
LEGAL and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the
population or can you provide unbiased statistics  I doubt you can
because I have never heard of an unbiased poll that has been conducted
it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford
them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you
would force upon them  I refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice
from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure

Where does it end  To refuse to fund the free distribution of guns is
to remove the choice to own a gun from some women and add the burden
of police protection to society

More guns in society does not reduce the burden on the police
it increases it

                                  To refuse to provide everyone with
an automobile is to remove the choice to drive from some women and add
the additional burden of public transportation to society

Now this is rediculous  Public transportation puts less of a burden on
transportation routes roads rails etc than private transportation
It also puts a lesser burden on the environment

                                                            To refuse
to fund a jobs for everyone is to remove the choice to work from some
women and add the additional burden of unemployment to society

Oh this makes sense  Ever hear of welfare  Know what it's all about



parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

Not to mention the fact that the people who would get the death
penalty are convicted of horrible crimes  Senseless murders
multiple murders and so on One could argue that these people have
no right to live in our society

Please show us this argument  I suspect it is quite strained as it
must include those wrongly convicted who remain innocent regardless
of the severity of the crimes

I said one could argue it I didn't say it was a convincing argument

We do not want them ever and we should not have to pay to keep
them alive for as long as they happen to live

First infants now certain adults  Does anyone have a right to life
Mr Parker  If so precisely who

Not infants you idiot  Infants are born

Who has a right to life  People who have not violated other's rights
have a right to life  A fetus is not a person  You can not have a
conversation with them  They are not biologically independent  Their
awareness is questionable  They have no experiences in the real world
to make up a personality

hudsonathenacsugaedu Paul Hudson Jr writes

If its a matter of money we could save a lot of money by killing off 
anyone with an expensive illness  It may decrease our population a bit
but we will have plenty of money to go around

Hey why not  Oh wait maybe their family members would object  Ya think
Their parentschildrenbrotherssisters  Is that the case with abortion

And if no family member objects should we allow this killing  Should
we include it as a costsaving device in our health care reform
package  These questions are not rhetorical

Ever hear of euthanasia  Ever hear of insurance companies refusing to
fund potentially lifesaving treatment because they don't feel there is
sufficient evidence that it will work to be worth the expense  Which one
gets you angrier  Why is that

There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among
Southern Baptists  I posted a summary over in bitlistservchristia and
I suppose that it might be useful here  Note that I do not necessarily
agree or disagree with any of what follows I present it as information

 

For a short summary  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book
claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity
Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity and Mr Holly blames that on the
Masons

The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department
which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ  A few
years ago they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry they concluded
that it was not a religion and therefore was outside their speciality
However Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry and
last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry  I got the
feeling that they were saying You got the wrong answer last time try to
do better and get the answer we want

Anyway there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions but
the dust has settled and the report is in  Nobody is entirely happy with it
but everybody seems willing to live with it  Both sides are saying things
such as This was the best we were going to get in the current environment

The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do such as the
hospitals and burn centers they operate as well as efforts to help the
elderly and prevent drug abuse  The report acknowledges that many well
known Christians are and have been Masons and notes that many teachings
of Masonry are supportive of Christian faith and practice  Examples of
the latter include belief in God emphases on honesty and integrity and
that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs

On the other hand they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible
with Southern Baptist principles  These included the use of titles which some
people consider sacrilegious the taking of certain oaths even though they
are not meant seriously the undeniably pagan andor occultic writings of
some Masonic leaders the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation
can be achieved by good works and the racial discrimination practiced by many
Masonic lodges  I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole
aren't really in a place to speak on this last point


The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion and says that membership
should not be endorsed or censured but left to the discretion of individuals
This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges
and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity another may
not  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of
the believer and the autonomy of the local church and this history probably
influenced how the report came out

 

The information above was gleaned from The Religious Herald a publication
of the Baptist General Association of Virginia and Baptists Today which
does not have any direct links to a religious organisation  Autonomy is a
big issue among some Baptists  

Because I have neither the report itself nor whatever Masonic documents are
relevant to these issues none of the above comes with a guarantee  Your
mileage may vary  Void where prohibited

The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be
treated as a matter of faith  Francis Hitching

  Neither I nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings  Who is he 
Please do not answer with A well known evolutionist or some other such
informationless phrase

   Francis Hitching is the author of among other books
The Neck of the Giraffe He believes evolution is
directed by some sort of cosmic force but does not like
Darwinism  He wrote in this book  The Neck of the
Giraffe Ticknor  Fields New Haven Connecticut 
p  p  paperback that

   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the
   great unifying principle of biology Darwinism after
   a century and a quarter is in a surprising amount of
   trouble  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to
   mean the same thing  But they don't  Evolution of
   life over a very long period of time is a fact if we
   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two
   centuries from geology paleontology molecular biol
   ogy and many other scientific disciplines  Despite
   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this
    the probability that evolution has occurred
   approaches certainty in scientific terms  On the
   other hand Darwinism or neoDarwinism its modern
   version is a theory that seeks to explain evolution
   It has not contrary to general belief and despite
   very great efforts been proved

   Research on Hitching turned up the following Hitching is
basically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien
tific credentials  In The Neck of the Giraffe he claimed
to be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute but an
inquiry to that institute said he was not  He implied in
the Acknowledgements of The Neck of the Giraffe that
paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writing
of the book but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know him
and had no information about him  Hitching also implied
that his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins but upon
inquiry Dawkins stated I know nothing at all about Francis
Hitching  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char
latan good for you  His book The Neck of the Giraffe
is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for
years

   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written on
Mayan pyramid energy and for some In Search Of episodes
on BBC television  The reference work Contemporary
Authors Vol  page  lists him as a member of the
Society for Psychical Research the British Society of
Dowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers  His writ
ings include Earth Magic Dowsing The Psi Connection
Mysterious World An Atlas of the Unexplained Fraud
Mischief and the Supernatural and Instead of Darwin

   Hitching's book spends much of its time attacking Dar
winian evolution borrowing heavily and uncritically from
youngearth creationist arguments  Many of Hitching's ref
erences are lifted from youngearth creationist literature
rather than being quoted directly from their original
sources  One magazine had this to say CreationEvolution
Newsletter  No  pp  SeptemberOctober 

   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society there was
   an interesting letter in the January  issue of
   their journal Biblical Creation p  concerning a
   review of Francis Hitching's  book The Neck of
   the Giraffe  Hitching's book is strongly anti
   Darwinist and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre
   ationists though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist
   creationists  The letter by creationist Malcolm
   Bowden author of The Rise of the Evolution Fraud
   points out that Hitching simply culled his informa
   tion from the creationist literature  This is indeed
   the case  many creationist works are cited favorably
   Anderson Coffin Clark Daly Davidheiser Dewar
   Gish Morris Segraves Whitcomb and Wysong plus
   various antiDarwinists  Hitching does cite Bowden's
   earlier book ApeMen  Fact or Fallacy but Bowden
   accuses Hitching of lifting several passages and
   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment
   in other words plagiarism  Hitchin's sic book is
   largely an exposition of the creationists sic view
   point from the beginning to almost the end Bowden
   points out  Hitching is also a paranormalist an
   advocate of psychic evolution Hitching's book
   Earth Magic is a wild extremely entertaining and
   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc
   tures  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic
   cataclysms Atlantis pyramidology dowsing ESP
   miraculous healing and astrology

MAGI 

Sneak Preview Later still eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
 ground for Iranian and JudeoChristian religions as can be seen in the famous
 Oracles of Hystaspes a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
 most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era probably the
 second century CE Widengren  The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
 the Future Saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
 to Bethlehem in the Gospel of Matthew 

  The Old Persian word magu rendered in Greek by magos is of uncertain 
etymology It may originally have meant member of the tribe as in the
Avestan compound mogutbish hostile to a member of the tribe This meaning
would have been further resticted among the Medes to member of the priestly
tribe and perhaps to priest Benveniste  Boyce  The term is
probably of Median origin given that Herodotus mentions the Magoi as one of
the six tribes of the Medes
  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a
priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran Among the Persians they were
responsible for liturgical functions as well as for maintaining their
knowledge of the holy and the occult Most likely the supremacy of the Median
priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median
monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century
through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the
Great  BCE The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political
and civil institutions as well Even if hypotheses have been advanced
concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period
Boyce  we must still maintain that they were of Median origin This is
demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian mentioned by
Darius I  BCE in the inscription at Bisutun Iran as well as by
Greek sources Indeed Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of
the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi
  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the
sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the
possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions This seems to be
attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis
  There is a theses put forth by Giuseppe Messina that denies that the Magi
are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of
the priesthood  a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin This thesis is
untenable on the other hand the hypothesis that their name is related to the
Avestan term magavan derived from the Gathic maga Vedic magha gift is
not without foundation Mole  The meaning of maga can probably be found
in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition within the context of the concept of
purity or separation of the mixture of the two opposed principles of spirit
and matter The maga which has been erroneously interpreted as chorus from
the root mangh which is said to mean sing the magic song Nyberg  and
has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica seems to be an
ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision In any case though
there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms
magavan and maga we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the
Avestan priesthood The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term despite
a recent hypothesis proposed by HW Bailey Old Persian inscriptions ignore
the Avestan term for priest athravan Vedic athravan even if this is 
perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis 
Gershevitch 
  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history the
Pahlavi terms moghmard and mobad represent its continuation The latter in
particular derives from an older form magupati head of the Magi During
the Sasanid period third to seventh centuries CE which saw the formation of
a hierarchically organized church the title mobadan mobad the high priest of
high priests came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy
  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage or khvaetvadatha Av Pahl
khwedodah They also performed a characteristic funeral rite the exposure of
the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it
The corpse was not supposed to decompose lest it be contaminated by the demons
of putrefaction This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian
community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the
Parsis in India Stone towers known as dakhmas were built especially for this
rite During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was
in vogue only among the Magi the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with
wax then buried it The practice was widespread however among the peoples
of Central Asia
  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship it was impossible to
offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus During the performance of a
ritual sacrifice the Magus sang of the theogony the Magi were possibly the
custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about the
relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta and was
called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future The Magi were also
known for the practice of killing harmful or Ahrimanical animals khrafstra
such as snakes and ants They dressed in the Median style wearing pants
tunics and coats with sleeves They wore a characteristic head covering of
felt Gr tiara with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose
and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their
breath Boyce  The color of these caps in conformity with a tradition
that is probably of IndoEuropean origin according to Georges Dumezil was
that of the priesthood white
  In all likelihood during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in
possession of a welldefined body of doctrine and it is probable that they
gradually adopted Zoroastrianism they were most likely a clergy consisting of
professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally
inclined to eclecticism and syncretism Nonetheless they must have been
jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions By virtue of this
they were the educators of the royal princes The wisest of them was responsible
for teaching the prince the magic of Zarathushtra son of Horomazes and thus
the cult of the gods Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with
the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageous and
master of himself
  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great
influence although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor Despite
several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of
Gaumata the Magian  in which according to Herodotus who calls himself
Smerdis the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation 
the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media
in Persia and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed
as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration
  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi They were
renowned as followers of Zarathushtra Zoroaster as the teachers of some of
the greatest Greek thinkers Pythagoras Democritus Plato as the wise men
who arrived guided by a star at the manger of the newborn savior in
Bethlehem and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India But they were
also known as the Chaldeans the priesthood of Babylon known for its occultism
this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek
like goes expert in the magic arts Bidez and Cumont  Indeed the
Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts especially astrology and
had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge
  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views it
is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the socalled
western Magi who were later hellenized In the Achaemenid period both must
have been at least in part Zoroastrian but the western Magi those of the
Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor Syria Mesopotamia and Armenia who came in
contact with diverse religious traditions must have sooner or later and in
varying degrees been influenced by syncretic concepts
  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and depending on their
varying concerns would emphasize one or the other aspect of them Classical
historians and geographers including Herodotus and Strabo document their
customs while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines dualism
belief in the hereafter Magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theology
and eschatology Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi
even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus In doing so they are repeating what the
Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods when they adopted
Zoroastrianism At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and
placed themselves under his venerable name
  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the
eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those
elements of the archaic religion that refused to die It has been said quite
often in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the
Zoroastrian tradition that the Vendidad from vidaevodata the lawabjuring
daivas part of the Avesta should be attributed to them This collection of
texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and
practices Nonetheless the hypothesis is hardly plausible since the first
chapter of the Vendidad  a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda the
supreme god of Zoroastrianism but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman Pahl
GathicAvestan Angra Mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source of
all evil and suffering  does not mention western Iran Persia or Media the
land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana Furthermore it
has been noted Gershevitch  that if the authors had been Magi the
absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions including their own
priesthood would be very strange
  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the
corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us from the second half of the
first millennium BCE on This has been their principal merit We can attribute
directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed known to
us especially from Greek sources and in part from the Pahlavi literature of
the ninth and tenth centuries CE According to this formulation the two poles
of the dualism are no longer as in the Gathas Spenta Mainyu beneficent
spirit and Angra Mainyu hostile spirit but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra
Mainyu Gershevitch  See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu This trans
formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro
astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the
Mesopotamian religious world In this new dualism  which was that later known
to the Greeks Aristotle Eudemus of Rhodes Theopompus and others  we can
see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism to which
we give the name Zurvanism See Zurvanism
  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism the Magi played an enormously
important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings as well as in
the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically Their
natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of
Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora The Greeks began
to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them Xanthus of Lydia
Hermodorus Aristotle Theopompus Hermippus Dinon even writing treatises
on the Persian religion of which only the titles and a few fragments have
survived In the Hellenistic period the Magi were seen as a secular school of
wisdom and writings on magic astrology and alchemy were lent the authority
of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra Ostanes and Hystaspes forming an
abundant apocryphal literature Bidez and Cumont 
  Later still eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
ground for Iranian and JudeoChristian religions as can be seen in the famous
Oracles of Hystaspes a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era probably the
second century CE Widengren  The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
the Future Saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
to Bethlehem in the Gospel of Matthew  See Saoshyant
  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the
religious history of Iran Concerned to win back the western Magi de Menasce
 and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of
Iran the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to
establish a true state church strongly hierarchical and endowed with an
orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures The leading figures
in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar
and Kerder the persecutors of Mani in the third century

SAOSHYANT
  The Avestan term saoshyant future benefactor MPers soshans designates
the savior of the world who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind
The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro
astrianism together with that of dualism it appears as early as in the Gathas
Zarathushtra Zoroaster as the prophet of the religion is himself a Sao
shyant one who performs his works for the Frashokereti the end of the present
state of the world when existence will be rehabilitated and made splendid
See Frashokereti
  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological
myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three All the saviors
are born from the seed of Zarathushtra which is preserved through the ages in
Lake Kansaoya identified with presentday Lake Helmand in Seistan Iran
protected by  fravashis or guardian spirits The greatest of the awaited
Saoshyants the victorious Astvatereta he who embodies truth the son of
the Vispataurvairi she who conquers all is the third who will make
existence splendid he appears in Yashts  Upon his arrival humankind will
no longer be subject to old age death or corruption and will be granted
unlimited power At that time the dead will be resurrected and the living will
be immortal and indestructable Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the
powerful enemies of the world of truth that is the world of the spirit and
of asha Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and
render it imperishable He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with
the forces of evil which will be destroyed
  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation
Kellens  as are those of his two brothers Ukhshyatereta he who makes
truth grow and Ukhshyatnemah he who makes reverence grow the names of the
three virgins Yashts  who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra
when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants are equally
speculative Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a
millennium initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence Astvatereta will
appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind
  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid
period sixth to fourth century BCE It was not perhaps the principal element
in the formation of the messianic idea but it was certainly a determining
factor one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the
confines of the Iranian world A similar concept that of the future Buddha
Maitreya was most likely indebted to it and Christian messianism can trace
its roots to the same source

The
question is On what authority do we proclaim that the requirements of the

  Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster

excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

	Is this Zeno's Paradox Nothing can get out of a black hole because
the escape velocity is the speed of light I don't know how time dialation
can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event horizon Can any
one explain how matter gets in

	I hope that it was clear that a black hole can lose mass to its
surroundings via the socalled Hawking rediation This is the idea that
virtual partical pairs can form so close to the event horizen that one
of the pair is trapped and the other goes free The conservation of
energy requires that the black hole lose mass albeit very slowly that
that if primordial black holes were formed the ones about the size of
small asteriods should be evaporating about now in the history of our
universe The story goes that we should be able to see the flashes caused
by the explosions that result at the end of these black holes Does this
idea still hold promise or has it been debunked

Evolution as I have said before is theory and fact  It is exactly
the same amount of each as the existence of atoms and the existence of
gravity  If you accept the existence of atoms and gravity as fact
then you should also accept the existence of evolution as fact

 
Andy

I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either  They are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  Gravity too is
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we call gravity  Gravity however is not 
a fact  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment  Newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force Einstein a wave Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it  That takes a great 
leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  Evolution
is no different

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage


stuff deleted

There's a very good reason for it  The insurance industry sets it's premiums
through a spreadthecostofrisk approach  Yes even though 
nonsmokers pay less they still pay more than if there were no smokers 
at all  And smokers pay for CEO quadruple bypass operations  And it
just goes on and on  Insurance is capitalistsocialism at its very best
And if you don't like it you're only choice right now is not to 
participate at all else start up your very own firm that ignores the 
risks you don't like

So are you happy now when  people including innocent kids
died today

	It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other
	One thing for sure  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself
	against the statements lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification
	made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him

		I don't know they murdered him I also don't know
		that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede

		It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such
		comments in advance of forensic pathology

	Stephen  thank you  God speed  

No Kinda numb I thought something like this was going to happen
over a week ago One of the things that's been obvious from the

	Yah

start is that when there are two armed camps neither of which 
yields it's usually get slaughtered  when any little spark 
sets it off

Which is why Koresh and company shouldn't have stockpiled weapons
and why the BATF shouldn't have come primed for a raid 

	BINGO  Am I the only one  to notice
	a	No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant
	b	Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it
	c	 ah God

			 children
			at least  adults
			plus  at the beginning
			and more BATF agents

			all dead


Painful point 

	If the Davidians fired first  why were the BATF
	on the roof  rather than taking cover

	Has anyone asked themselves these questions

	  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the
	  opening rounds  I seem to recall missing several key parts
		a  The first five minutes of day one only the shooting
		  part comes out
		b  What happened to the Feds video units  You mean they do
		  not carry helmet cams  Wonder why not
	   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission
	  video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record

		a  You realize the units carry ittle bitty mm backups
			That hold  minutes per unit  And there are
			twounits on the professional handhelds so no
			tape turnover gaps
		b  Until all views are seen it is premature to point
			fingers in either direction

	As you well point out Stephen


	Anyone BATF BD XBD Other could have touched it off
	by mistake or maliciously

	More on this below


	Once Koresh was shot disregarding his being a religious
	leader and apocalyptically obsessed most likely the people
	inside just went on drill Just like the BATF outside

Is the lesson that automatic responses are very hazardous last resort 
measures

	Yes  But it is so hard toremain human under the full
	pressure of hazard game playing and life



Painful point 

	Either side could have backed off to help defuse the
	situation  We see the problem constantly here on the
	net with flaming  

Ego problems  Nuff said 

	More to the point  when someone dies almost like it was intended
	that way both sides will kill to maintain their innocence 
		a contradiction in terms



Painful point 

	It doesn't help to take sides in such a situation Just
	adds fuel to the fire Better is to let it burn out on
	it's own 

	True  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out
	from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened


Best example I can think of is Christ with the tax coin He didn't 
have one and so didn't sanction the Roman authority unduly When 
they showed it to him he noted that it was Caesar's minting and
so said give it to him no waste of time And then he got back to
more worthwhile concerns  God's will 

	This requires someone interested in God's Will  Please note
	that the outstanding overt problem in this country today
	is one where the Government

		wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt


The antitax movement of today and the antissanasid groups
would do well to note who the issuing authority is Ditto for those

	Yes  The AMerican People  Not the Federal Government
	ANd if it is not spent towards that end noone deserves
	the coin


made in the image of God

	Yah  Fewpeople hear the contradiction

		Money
		made
		in the image
		of God


No need to stir things up in ever larger revorevorevolution as
governments turn over and over and over 

	I wish you were wrong  Many pundits are saying  years
	The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce and my
	exposure to the Damned pardon me American Divorce Attorney
	is

		I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation



painful point 

	For many this was just entertainment 
	
	Thumbsup Thumbsdown 

	Just another thriller like Terminator 
	or a goodold ball game

Is the lesson that we've become jaded to media reality

	 children dead  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh  or the BATF
	helps this any at all is sick  and wrong

		The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely
		straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences
		havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that
		Koresh or his followers caused this

		The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations
		and morals not my fault Koresh did it than they
		are with

			 dead children

	Same goes for Koresh  his followers  who are all mostly dead




Painful point 

       	LA burned The Davidians burned In one case society has
	abandoned the people  which has returned to a frontier
	In the other  the outskirts were bumping against the
	suburbs 

Is the lesson that what's lawful in different areas of society
depends more on conditions than laws

	More on power and favoritism  My personal opinion

	Look to history  whenever privilege has replaced whatever
	token of objective law and justice a society has had

		Hitlerrs have followed



If we don't learnthelessons or at least make an honest effort
the next conflagration will no doubt be closer to home 

Rather than putting out fires aren't there much more important
concerns for us to work on

	You do your name sake proud Stephen
	Its hard but please keep on keeping on
		each voice in the wilderness now will
		save a generation unborn from horror


Kent
who can't 'cheers' today exactly

What keeps me from being a bombthrower is my loving God as irra
tional as that is for so many One direct benefit is being able to 
keep things in perspective KS

	The day I need a gun or abomb to protect myself in this
	society is the day that society is already beyond redemption

		and that aint' redundant if you have any Christian
		belief aytall

	 and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the
	act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the
	wrongs that my society practises without undue harm or
	punishment befalling me is the day that society has ceased to
	be a human society and become a society of animals

		We are very cclose to that


Such as who hurts more  the ones who died or the loved ones who 
are left Besides the lessons It's also time for many to grieve
Including those who've lost their faith in others or in God

I'm learning to be patient and let things heal God willing

	Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue  still struggling to be
	patient

For those who like contrary questions

	NB  I was not there  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law
	official hater  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same
	The official side has its advocates already lets balance the
	equation and asj a few questions on the other side for the sake
	of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass

		innocent until proven guilty
	not
		innocent until presumed guilty

	  Where are the video tapes from the tanks  ALL of them

		Don't tell me they do not exist  They are standard
		equipment

	  So you think Koresh fired the place because of the explosion

		a  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it  This
		  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as nonflammable
		  as possible  It is as nonflammable as possible

			 gotcha

		   when in isolation from other substances

		  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote
		  launchers  WHy did the FBI not announce this window
		  blown in plus tear gas five minutes then the wall come
		  down and maintain a left to right sequence

		b  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound that when
		  mixed in becomes a VERY flammable and difficult to trace
		  suspension with a VERY special property  exposure to
		  brief eruptions of high heat muzzle blasts or long
		  exposure to low heat matches a stove will NOT tend
		  to ignite

			What other chemicals come up in the forensics
			Who else will be allowed to test the site

		c  After a few minutes to hours ifdesired the combnation
		  rate can be controlled as desired the mixture can be made
		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature
		  above a certain point a tracer round for a certain
		  heat quantity a small explosive charge or for a length
		  of time start a wall fire and wait

			Check your military records look at the tapes
			Why were tanks large capacity delivey systems
			tear gas why not somnorifics and now why
			the hurry was there still a comm channel open
			to the outside

			Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the
			compound in the videos  ALL the videos  Which ones
			are missing

	Do I sound paranoid  Maybe  Am I Probably not
	You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement
		IN advance of a Court  God help us
			For we are surely not helping ourselves
	You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate

		You are  trillion admitted down and counting
		Look again

	Did it happen that way  I do not know  I was not there
		AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE
	But will that happen   people will NOT have the chance
		to tell their side as the BATF leader was on camera

No one wins  Except  more force next time

	Listen to your hearts people

Thanx again Stephen

	Just thought I'd clear up a few of the murky areas

Actually after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo and later Carthage
the Mormons DID fortify Utah  They still arm themselves to defend the
faith and stockpile food as well  They have been involved in quite a
lot of illegal activity  including multiple and often underage wives
for the leaders  a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their
sect  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking
                                         
	Joseph Smith started the sect  After he and his brother Hyram
were murdered in a Nauvoo Il jail cell church membership split over
who to follow  Initially Smith was considered a prophet just like
Mohammed a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider
Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews I'm led to understand  Make
no mistake this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith  The
thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed
down father to son  After Joseph Smith died his son was only
entering his teens  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have
been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death  The
Council of Twelve the Church governing body wasn't of much help
here and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects
Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake  The rest waited
for Smith Jr to grow up enough to assume leadership  The other
claimants to the leadership were soon ignored like Mike Dukakis 

	Both sects practiced the year food stockpile doctrine
and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at
least owned weapons  There is little evidence that they were a
militaristic sect given that they tended to move on rather than
face largescale opposition  Brigham Young having suffered a
great deal getting to Salt Lake seems to have been quite
justified in making military training a good thing  Remember
this was far beyond where even the US Army went and these people
had nobody to turn to save themselves

	Just a little context to put this all in perspective

So what did the Mormons get  It seems that J Edgar Hoover was very
impressed with the way they kept secrets  They're pledged to defend
secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood  Many actually
do  even to the point of suicide

	The RLDS the Reorganized LDS are friendly rivals of the LDS
and delight in telling stories about them which generates quick retorts
from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time  At no time have
I ever even heard this hinted at  I'm taking it with a salt block

  So he hired virtually no one but
Mormons until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the
Church of Later Day Saints  Though J Edgar is finally gone the FBI
personnel especially the field agents are still heavily Mormon
I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment
of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical

	If it's true there would be little affect  LDS and RLDS
philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
Church as set down by Jesus but that God will judge each on his
own merits  In addition the RLDS also contend and the LDS may
as well that ignorance of the True Way tm is an excuse  You
can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected
it  In short LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to
Buddhists secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they
will not be penalized for ignorance  It is more likely that Hoover
liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade
alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like
These people are the salt of the Earth and as such are more
easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them

	That's my somewhat educated guess anyway  Both sects have
splinter groups that don't mirror the masses but these are small
and rare and hardly worth noting their common ancestry

	None of this has any relevance to guns though  When a
man's religion is used to deny him the right of selfprotection with
the weapons suitable for the job he'll find an ally in me

 There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to
 worship on the Sabbath Saturday  The bestknown are the SeventhDay
 Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses  They argue that Act  is not a
 regular worship service but a special meeting to see Paul off and
 that I Cor  doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service

Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Christians are required to observe
the Sabbath whether it is on Saturday or Sunday  The Sabbath was part
of a Covenent between God and the Israelites and is not required for
Christians

Sorry but it doesn't matter what you think I am a Christian who happens to

I don't usually read trm  It is truly informative to stop by and see that there
are still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts
of Utah and then out of the country entirely  My grandmother was born in Mexico
where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US  I'm willing
to admit that members of other churches are Christians if they believe in Christ and
try to follow his teachings even though they have different interpretations of 
the bible  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether
or not I am considered to be Christian  Could someone mail me a set of rulesbeliefs
that must be followed to be a Christian  Does this set of rules exclude other large
bodies of believers  

I know this is a waste of everyone's time this has probably been discussed N times

bskendignetcomcom Brian Kendig writes

And I maintain

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms  

Are you your own master  Do you have any habits that you cannot break

If I have a habit that I really want to break and I am willing to
make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it then I do so
There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the
effort to break and I've done so there have been other bad habits
that I've decided are not worth the effort to break  It's my choice
either way

I am my own master  I choose what I want to do  I weigh the benefits
of my actions against their consequences and I use my experience to
help me deal with the unexpected which in turn make me more experienced

I don't always succeed but I never fail either  I learn

Do you have any habits you can't break  Why not

For one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
even the slightest concept of the Bible

I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity just as you've
probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most
likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion
Are you unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the
slightest concept of the Quran  If that's different then how is it
different from what you accuse me of  Can I accuse you of having no
desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism

How about sexual sins  Gotta any of those secret desires
in your head that you harbor but can get control of   Do you dehumanize
women when they walk past you  Do you degrade them to a sex object in
your head

Of COURSE not  That's disgusting  For centuries religions have been
discriminating on sex and treating women as secondclass humans
that's one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity

Do you insult
people unknowingly then regret it later  Yet do it again the next
time opportunity presents itself

No  I don't insult people  Period  It's not in my nature and it's
not something that I want to do either

Are you truly the master of yourself

Not yet  but my life is the ground I use to practice on  The fun is
in the getting there

I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times
That I sometimes say things I do want to say and then repeat my mistake
unwantingly  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect
of my being  There are times I know I shouldn't say something but
then say it anyway  There are times I simply forget a lesson
I in fact am not my own master

We don't start out perfect we've got to strive to be something
better  I know my shortcomings and I know my strengths and I live
my life according to the decisions I make and I am content to abide
with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the
praise for them  There have been times in my life when I've made
mistakes yes I try to never make the same mistake twice

I need help  Jesus promised me
this help  And I took him up on his offer  I have willfully let
Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than
I myself do

I regard Christ as a myth  I feel that there are far too many people
offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
did  The only person who can really judge me is me  I choose the
roads I travel and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of
any given road or turn back  and as long as I don't always turn
back there's no shame in it  When I need help I seek out my friends

Do you see my point  I think you're the one under the rock and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism  come and join me  It will be
a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the
long hike but it's well worth it

Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you  Because Brian you enjoy
not having a clue about the Bible   

And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying either  Open your
eyes and SEE open your ears and LISTEN  I'm not just spouting off
empty words  This is my LIFE this is what gives me MEANING

Don't you see  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness
with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not
something as megapowerful as what you're trying to get me to accept
Surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good
reason to don't you

Can you witness motherly love with your senses  How does caring and
concern for you register with your senses  If nothing registers
to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch
then you better become a Vulcan and fast  You better get rid
of your emotions

Huh  You're going WAY off the track here

I say my mother loves me  How do I know you ask  I can point to
definite things she's done for me and I can even just bring her to
you so you can ask her facetoface

You say your deity loves you  How do you know I ask  You can't even
convince me that it exists

My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING  You have
life forever  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal
torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to 
live it in paradise with God  That is what my God says  And that
was the issue  Your madeup theism is what it ismade up  It's
wishful thinking

If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot promising untold
pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
rationality for just this once then I would choose 'hell'  I can
not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful
it is

Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way
Yahweh Allah Zeus Odin Ra  Please give me a solid reason to
choose one of them over the others

 description of Kendigism deleted  hee hee 

Why would you want to live a good life
To you you die and that's it  Don't contradict yourself  You have
no reason to live a good life  It doesn't do you any good in the
end  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway  So you have no reason to lead a good life Leading
a good life is meaningless   Why do you do such a meaningless thing

That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word
I've said

Have you ever gone to an amusement park  Why  I mean after a few
hours it closes and nothing's different except that you're a few
dollars lighter  Going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good
at all  Why do you do such a meaningless thing

The answer is that you think it's fun  You play the skeeball over

not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you

Forget the Bible for a minute  Forget quoting verses forget about
who said what about this or that  Show me  Picture just you and me
and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you're right

Forget that I am a person  Forget that I know how to type  Forget
that I know how to put a sentence together  Forget that I know
how to send email   Forget my existence  Proove to me that I
exist  

I can't do it because your existence means nothing more to me than
just your communications over the net  You have no more bearing on
nor importance in my life than that remove it and you will cease to
be significant to me

Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without
invoking them

Or do you mean that the existence of your deity and in fact any
other deity that can be written about is as real as your own
existence

Why do you believe what you believe

What are the consequences of the homophobic ranting of the
selfrighteous  Well I just noted this on another group
and thought I'd pass it along  The context is talkorigins
and a report of yet another debate that was nothing but an
attempt at mindless bullying and factless assertion by a
standardissue Creationist  The writer reflects that the
behavior reported reminds him of some Christian groups he has
known  I believe that the writer is a nonhomosexual Christian

	There is a very effective technique used to promote
	unit cohesion among the Soldiers of the Lord  It is
	called witnessing  I've seen this process used well
	and poorly the near devil worship I mention was a group 
	 that was using the witnessing to get people lathered
	up to go kill homosexuals or at least terrorize them off 
	campus as it was clearly God's will that they do so

I have deleted the specifics of the location as I do not
believe it characteristic of the place a state in which I
spent my formative first  years though it does have
unfortunately a subpopulation that this remark fits to a tee

Y'know when the right to bear arms was invented all we had to worry
about was the shotgun and pistol Now we have to worry about drivebys
with Uzis sparaying the entire neighborhood with bullets

Aside from the fact that you will be flamed up one side and down the other
for suggesting that the RKBA was invented rather than merely recognized
your assertion merely reinforces the knowledge that RKBA must be maintained
so that we the People can protect our own neighborhoods  The police
certainly aren't doing it  How long did it take the DC police to catch
that driveby shotgunner note that he wasn't using an Uzi but one of
those shotguns you claim we needed to worry about back then  I believe
there were eleven attacks before the police ever caught a suspect

No I don't see what the popularity of a value has to do with whether
it is objective or not Pls explain
If almost all people agree that the sun exists in the usual uncritical sense
and almost all people agree that  a deal is bad  it's a reasonable 
conclusion that the sun really does exist and that the deal really is bad
I disagree completely Until rather recently most people did not
believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb Popular
opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact
True but nevertheless the basis of all matters of fact is overwhelming
popular opinion and some overwhelming popular opinion is fact the
sun shines  If it were not so physics would be a personal matter
assumed to be different for each of us  There would be YourGravity and
MyGravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict
both  
This is simply complete nonsense The basis for 'matters of fact' is
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is

about raw observations the dial reads  matter in other words though 
they can surely be mistaken or even lying there too I saw the statue 
move  Getting to theories from raw facts is certainly errorprone but
one assumes that the raw facts are usually as reported otherwise science
is impossible  
Opinions about 'raw facts' as you call them are somewhat different
than interpretations of those raw facts

Now I take an experience of goodevil to be every bit as raw a fact as an
experience of pain or vision
That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says

  For me an ethical standard can be nothing
more than a hypothesis about the modification of observed value through
human actions It will be better if  You ought
See above We can't seem to agree on what's better

   In that context
then I see the choice as being between scepticism relativism and 
objectivism  IMO the existence of supermajority experiences of
good life freedom truth peace love intelligence testifies that
objectivism is true for fundamental values  and this in turn is weak 
evidence that objective ethics may be possible
I don't see that it's any evidence at all
As I point out above I'm really not interested very much in
what the popular opinion is I'm prepared to trustto some extent
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
because by and large they accord with my own However if everyone
else said the dial read  and it looked like a  to me I would
hope that I would believe myself Ie believing other people about
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
what I would believe if I observed myself but the possibility exists
that it is not Since I know from observation that others disagree
with me about what is good I believe I can discount popular opinion
about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually

  I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that something is
better than nothing is a rational and objective valuation
Nope No tetanus is better than tetanus
I was referring to the situation at hand in which something is better than 
nothing  is a rational valuation for any disinterested observer not
making a general observation on all situations    But you knew that
No I didn't I assumed you were merely making a generalization
which you hadn't thought through very carefully You're not much of
a mindreader Frank
Nor are you it seems  cf I assumed above  
Perhaps true but I didn't make assertions about what you believed
You did

 Since both statements to all intents and purposes say effectively
 the same thing 

Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force
in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is
not moral say effectively the same thing

Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and
the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two 
statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when
they say effectively the same thing

                  and lead one to do precisely the same thing then 
 either both statements are doublespeak or none

They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what
motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
same thing

  Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
  the use of force
  
  With a few provisos yes  Minimum force for a start And it
  depends on what is being forced on either side   
  
  Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
  people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
  that our own actions in doing so are not moral
  
  My opinion is that our actions would be moral and it would be
  immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective  
  Again there many caveats and provisios
  
  Note my usage of my opinion is an admission that I don't have a lock
  on morals not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on

 For what it's worth  and yes I know you claim to be an agnostic 
 it's this ability to relabel things from immoral to moral 
 that I find one of the least attractive qualities of the religious
 mind
 
 jon
 
 I think the application of computers to law has something to add to this
 discussion  My knowledge of this is limited to reading a few papers in
 it I had set my students an essay on the topic so I had to know enough
 to understand them
 
 Before I did my reading I was of the opinion that you could use a formal
 language to define laws and a formal system to decide whether they had
 been broken or not  In principle you could leave it up to humans to find
 out the lowerlevel facts and then just feed them in to the computer
 which would be able to pronounce judgement  Or so I thought
 
 From my reading I discovered that this is not yet possible and may not be
 possible in principle  The reason is that every case that comes to trial
 is unique with its own collection of special facts  It is beyond human
 power to specify all the possible circumstances that may bear upon a case
 in advance  We have to judge each one on its own merits and simply take
 the formal law as a guide  The law is an ass we must be careful to use
 it as a beast of burden and not expect anything more from it
 
 How does this apply to this discussion  It makes me suspect anything that
 claims to be and objective or absolute moral standard  If we had such a
 standard we'd be able to write it down unambiguously  Any such object
 must say this is right and that is wrong  yet that is exactly
 what research shows we can't do

Just as well then that I'm not claiming that my own moral system is
absolute

 I can produce a list of sufficient conditions for not owner which will 
 satisfy almost anyone  It's fairly clear who doesn't own the states  I 
 don't for example and nor do you   It's also clear that regardless of who 
 owns the states  is a bad deal in all plausible cases  So even in the 
 absence of an objective definition of owner though that is an interesting and
 important point which jon livesey has also raised about the word Freedom
 the conclusion stands

Now I'll raise the issue again in connection with Mr O'Dwyer's use
of the word plausible

I can plause all kinds of cases for example in which people 
actually own land but don't know that and so are willing to sell 
it in play for derisory sums only to find that they sold it for
real   Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired   Cases
in which they err about the true value of what they are selling

Pretty soon you have to start talking about informed owner
competent owner educated owner and so on and the concept
gets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible

But the real problem remains that of looking only at endpoints
in a context    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble 
is small and that the Moon is big but that does not mean that
you have an objective measuring scale   Only that these two are 
fairly common opinions in context

An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually tiny and
a microbiologist may remark that a pebble is huge   Similarly
if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his 
life for his land rather than killing him and taking it for free 
the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal

Kermit Tensmeyer quoted from a few sources and then wrote something
I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said and 
then address Kermit's offering

John Redelfs originally wrote

  jr I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his
  jr death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse  It
  jr requires faith in Christ proven by following him by keeping his
  jr commandments  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed

Tom Albrecht responded

  ta So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross

John Redelfs wrote back that

  jr Paradise and salvation are not the same thing  Salvation is better
  jr Refer to John 

I responded to John that

  rw    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise
  rw
  rw    Rather I see implied the fact that only those who are saved
  rw may enter paradise

To which Kermit wrote

kt Incomplete reference
kt
kt See also the discussion Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group
kt for the arguments that Paradise and Hellsheol are places after death
kt The discussion no LDS were involved as far as I could see argued using
kt standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the
kt LDS position
kt
kt    Christ went to paridise after his death and burial
kt
kt    He taught the prisoners and freed them from Darkness
kt
kt    When he was resurrected he had not yet ascended to his father
kt
kt The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical
kt terms for those places

     I respond

     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise
     before entering into heaven No one has made a point for or against 
     that issue nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox
     belief The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom Luke  
     the place of the righteous dead in sheol equivalent to hades

     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent
     on their death bed Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was
     contradictory to what John's position put forward The thief on the 
     cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise the abode of 
     the righteous dead John's position possibly needs to be reworked
     Kermit needs to address the topic at hand

 Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call
 themselves Christian and yet are not  The BD's contradicted scripture
 in their actions  They were NOT Christian  Simple as that  Perhaps
 you have read too much into what the media has portrayed  Ask any
 truebelieving Christian and you will find that they will deny any
 association with the BD's  Even the th Day Adventists have denied any
 further ties with this cult which was what they were

Well if they were Satanists or followers of an obscure religion
then I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and 
make this to a show case But when we are dealing with a fanatical
Revelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone including the
innocent children then it seems that we are dealing with Christians 
and christians note the spelling
 
 Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein a 
 supposedly devout Muslim  I don't  Saddam is just a dictator using
 the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends

And does not this show the dangers with religion  in order 
word a mind virus that will make mothers capable of letting
their small children burn to ashes while they scream

Well looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various
places at the same time which would indicate that this was a planned
action I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't deliberately start a possible
fire having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier 
method Looking at the careful operation and use of tear gas
that as I know don't start fires it is less likely that this 
was the case

Sorry but my bets are on fanatical people keen to start
Armageddon  theirs

There's another point to be made Those who have been inside burning
houses know that if they want to stay alive it's better to run out
from the building We had one case where an FBI agent had to 
drag out a women from the burning house she run back in when
she saw the forces arriving It is a good indication of the fanatical
mind that the followers had  including having they children burned
instead of saving these innocent victims of the instance

 I understand and sympathize with your pain  What happened in Waco was a very
 sad tradgedy  Don't take it out on us Christians though  The Branch
 Davidians were not an organized religion  They were a cult led by a egomaniac
 cult leader  The Christian faith stands only on the shoulders of one man
 the Lord of Lords and King of Kings Jesus Christ   BTW David Koresh was NOT
 Jesus Christ as he claimed

The interesting notion is that I watched TV tonight Koresh never
claimed officially to be Jesus Christ His believers hoped that 
he would be but he never took this standpoint himself

He was more interested in breaking the seven seals of Revelation
and make sure that Armageddon would start Well it did and 
children died and no God saved them

 created AMORC as a subsidiary  an interesting question

If anyone is interested in the history of AMORC I do think Spencer

   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZATI AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW Part        

continued from Droplet Vol  No  Part 

   THIRD SIGN  The miracles of Muhammad SAW
are extremely varied  Because his messengership is
universal he has been distinguished by  miracles that
relate to almost all species of creation
    Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler arriving
with many gifts in a city where various people live will be
welcomed by a representative of each people who
acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language
so too when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of
Pre and  PostEternity  Ezel and Ebed  Sultani honored the
universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the
earth and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual
gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from
the realities of the whole universe each species of
creation from water rocks trees animals and human
beings to the moon sun and stars welcomed him and
acclaimed his prophethood each in its own language and
each bearing one of his miracles
    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all
his miracles  As the punctilious scholars have written
many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood
here we will briefly point out only the general category
into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted
as accurate reports
    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad
SAW fall into two main categories  

    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal 
events that happened at the time of his birth or before his 
declaration of prophethood  

    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences 
of the prophethood and contains two subdivisions 

     Those wonders that were manifested after
his departure from this world in order to confirm his
prophethood and 
	 Those that he exhibited during the era
of his prophethood  The latter has also two parts  
	 The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest
in his own personality his inner and outer being his moral
conduct and perfection and 
     The miracles that related to substantial matters  
The last part again has two branches  
	 Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality and 
	 Those relating to matter and creation  This last 
branch is again divided into two categories  
	 The first involves the paranormal happenings 
that occured during his mission either to break the 
stubbornness of the unbelievers or to augment the
faith of the belivers  This category has twenty different
sorts such as the splitting of the moon the flowing of
water from the fingers the satisfying of large numbers with
a little food and the speaking of trees rocks and animals
Each of these sons has also many instances and thus
has in meaning the strength of confirmation by
consensus  
	  As for the second category this
includes events lying in the future that occured as he had
predicted upon Allah SWT's instructions  Now starting
from the last category we will summarize a list of them

 Unfonunately I could not write as I had intended
without choice I wrote as my head dictated and I could
not completely conform to the order of this classification

 question is On what authority do we proclaim that the requirements of the
               
 fourth commandment are no longer relevant to modern Christians  Please
 
I don't believe most Christians believe they are above the Law  However
we are not saved by adherence to the Law  The Law exists to tell us what
is sinful  We all sin

Hence we are all above the Law where all in this case refers to
Christians

Jews believe that their sins are atoned for with
blood sacrifice of animals as described in the Old Testament

When was the last time you heard about a Jewish animal sacrifice

Christians 
believe that their sins are atoned for by the blood sacrifice of Jesus

The blood sacrifice of an innocent man

This does not make the Law 'irrelevant'

Then why don't Christians follow it why don't they even follow their
own Ten Commandments

Breaking the Law is sinful
and we are to avoid sinful ways but sinning by itself does not jeopardize
salvation

So in short Hitler is in heaven and Gandhi is in Hell

Note that I'm not a theologian  But this is the gist of several
sermons I've heard lately and some Bible studies I've been through  

Did you ever wonder if someone perhaps a great deceiver was pulling
your leg

	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called
DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever
 
I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
would see stuff coming in from the outside

  Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see how
anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original mass that
formed is forming the black hole in the first place

  Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

No it doesn't  Check again in any of the popular GR texts Misner
Thorne and Wheeler for example  It takes a finite proper time for
anything near the horizon to cross it if it's going to in the first
place and a finite proper time for anything crossing the horizon to
reach r

 You're admitting a lot more than that  You are admitting that
 your morals are situational   You are admitting that the actions
 of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
 how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions
 
 Sure
 
 If you employ X degree of force that's not moral but if you employ
 X degree of force but previously someone else has employed Y degree
 of force and the situation is thusandso that is moral
 
 Sure within the limits of what I know
 
 This is quite different from saying Employing force on other people
 is immoral period   Unfortunately from time to time we are obliged
 to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
 we have to bear the moral consequences of that
 
 Since both statements to all intents and purposes say effectively
 the same thing 

Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force
in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is
not moral say effectively the same thing

Yes when you tag on the Unfortunately  then to all intents and
purposes you are saying the same thing

Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and
the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two 
statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when
they say effectively the same thing

What they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator

                  and lead one to do precisely the same thing then 
 either both statements are doublespeak or none

They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what
motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
same thing

That's not true  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum 
force and still be a pacifist  If the minimum is  great   but one is
always trying to get as close to  force as possible under that belief
Not the same as 'force is immoral period' but still tending to pacifism

I recall reading in Michael  Rutherford's novel Sarum a scene in
which the son of a Roman nobleman living in Britain takes part in a
secret ceremony involving a bull  He stands naked in a pit covered
with some sort of scaffolding while assistants coax a bull to stand on
the scaffolding  They then fatally stab the bull which douses the
worshipper in the pit with blood  This is supposedly some sort of
rite of passage for members of the bull cult  I wonder if this is
related to the Mithras cult

I don't know where Rutherford got his information for this chapter
The book is historical fiction and most of the general events which
take place are largely based on historical accounts

There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbell's
OccidentalMythology  He also described levels of initiation I think
  I don't know where Campbell got his info but I remember thinking he
was being a little eclectic

I also wonder what if any connection there is between the ancient bull
cults and the current practice of bullfighting popular in some
Mediterranean cultures

Quite a bit  If you haven't read Campbell give him a try

I'll yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way
to discuss it  If you're interested in a change here's an idea

	Do you believe in absolute morality And do you have absolute
knowledge Mere mortal you And if you claim that your God has absolute
knowledge then you have have absolute knowledge of that

	If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God and
in it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to but the prophets
no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals
then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word of
God have got it right Also you read their words in translation which
invariably introduces errors of nuance and usage and then how do you
know that you got the right message I assert that you do not and that
you do not have absolute knowledge of anything including absolute morals

	The only way you can assert such things is through appeal to
prejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a group
you have aligned yourself to

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that 

	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to
man How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of
established religion is anything other than social convention One
way is to assert that there are moral universals But that is not
the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen
to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties

What right do
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality

	We expect empathy from our fellow man We expect to raise each
generation with values that we live by those which assure that mistakes
we have made are not repeated Do you think that mere authority checks
all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life I think not In fact
authority is power and power corrupts The most powerful tend to think
that they are above the law that applies to everybody else Religious
authority theocarcy has not mitigated this any better than other
power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no
checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses
recorded by history are greater

	We live and teach morals by setting an example starting in
the home This does not come from books or authority figures in
soceity If people are weak or confused at the present time it is
not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some
mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas
will repair That is but magical and simplistic thinking We need to
look at forces in the way we live even the good things that happen
in our present culture that are weakening the family as the primary
means we have to teach children values Of course people are trying
to have the community do things that once were done in the family
alone This may not be as effective We need to look at this

Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your brother and say
 that I was 
exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didn't want
anyone forcing their morality on me or I don't follow your morality 

	Laying down the law and with teeth doesn't stop the crazy
man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law It
may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact but it
may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people
from murduring

	It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianism
is in fact It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhat
isolated that do not experience change and have long standing
traditions In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisions
people have to make everyday In a real sense thay allow people to not
have to think That is OK when things are stable but it becomes a
problem when conditions change This leads me to think that morals are
not sumething fundemental at least most of them recalling that there
are values all people seem to agree on but mutate in response to outside
political economic technical and cultural influiences

	Lately I have come to regard people who speak like you
with great suspicion especially when they include the pharse for
the children I think that such people are more of an imparative to
want to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits
such as of the truth

So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
on their house killing most of the people inside

I'm not that annoyed about the adults they knew supposedly what
they were doing and it's their own actions

What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside
including mothers let the children suffer and die during awful
conditions

If this is considered religious following to the end I'm proud
that I don't follow such fanatical and noncompassionate religions

You might want to die for whatever purpose but please spare
the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all

I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity
knows about the word compassion Christians do you think 
the actions today would produce a good picture of your 
religion

 hardly expect them to accept anything that Christ said  But I don't feel
 any animosity towards them  Even though they persecuted Jesus and his
 disciples and eventually crucified Him I bear them no ill will  If anything
 I feel pity for them  Jesus had to die to pay the price for our sins and
 so the Jews were merely fulfilling prophesy  Jesus knew He had to die even
 before He began His ministry  That demonstrates the great depth of His love
 for us

Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the
children who died today at the Davidian complex

Sorry but the events today made me even more negative concering
organized religion

 	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
 from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called
 DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever
  
 I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
 the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
 would see stuff coming in from the outside

   Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see how
 anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original mass 
 that formed is forming the black hole in the first place

   Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever 
 faster towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space 
 caused by the excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon 
 it has further to travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the 
                                                            
When you look into the math of the different possible frames of reference
you will find out that this time is not physically relevant

 event horizon of   
 infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

 No it doesn't  Check again in any of the popular GR texts Misner
 Thorne and Wheeler for example  It takes a finite proper time for
                                                 
The relevant time for the falling object

 anything near the horizon to cross it if it's going to in the first
 place and a finite proper time for anything crossing the horizon to
 reach r
         center of the hole where the evil singularity lurks

There is NO singularity at the horizon  The appearance that there is one
comes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn't map properly
physically in this geometry rather analogous to the singularity at
the North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitude
lines  Such singular behavior as the earlier post suggested infinite
time to reach the horizon is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choice
of coordinates  As Paul says in the object's frame of reference
it WILL hit the horizon in finite time and then plunge to the singularity
that IS a real singularity in a short for small holes further finite 
amount of time

Not only that but to an OUTSIDE observer an object that falls into a black
hole disappears in a finite time also in spite of the relativistic slow
down that intuition suggests  This is because any light emitted by the
object as it falls or is shone onto it by a separate flashlight consists
of individual FINITE quanta and only a finite number of these can reach
the object before it plunges through the horizon  These will be succesively
more redshifted true but only a finite number of them will hit the object
and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they
too are inside the horizon and thus cannot come out

This reddening dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast as the object 
approaches the horizon when you do the math

As Paul says this is discussed in Misner Thorne and Wheeler's book 
Gravity where they talk about the appropriatness sp of the term black 
hole and the inappropriatness sp of an older term frozen star which 
was used earlier in this century before all the implications of blackhole 
theory were understood  Do not let the math deter you from looking at this 
book it's got a lot of good prose discussions of this material in between 
the equations that is VERY good reading IMHO

Of course it's all just THEORY

 I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either  They are extremely useful
 mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
 Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  Gravity too is
 very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
 have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
 objects by this thing we call gravity  Gravity however is not 
 a fact  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
 behave in our physical environment  Newton thought gravity was a
 simple vector force Einstein a wave Both are very useful models that 
 have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
 want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
 the way the theory now formulated talks about it  That takes a great 
 leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  Evolution
 is no different

Perhaps the major difference here is that we notice something which we call
gravity and then do some modelling around it  I myself do not notice any
deity  Hence a model cannot be made  A deity is an abstract and hence
religion may be considered a model of an abstract

Besides we can always change the model of gravity if the one we have doesn't
work too well  Can you imagine this with the bible  Erm excuse me I bought
this about  years ago and it doesn't seem quite rightcan I have an
improved model please

some deleted

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  
 
Bill I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who in the course of his or her research is willing to let the
chips fall where they may  This excludes literalists who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists  They find what they want to find  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others
 
Why an insert  Read it  I have a number of times  The passage is glaringly
out of context and Josephus a superb writer had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work  The passage has nothing to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears

I think this is a weak argument  The fact is there are two references to
Jesus in Antiquities of the Jews one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians  Origen wrote in the third century that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah while the long passage
says the opposite  There is an Arabic manuscript of Antiquities of the
Jews which contains a version of the passage which is much less gungho
for Jesus and may be authentic
   There is no question that Origen in the third century saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus  There are no manuscripts of Antiquities which
lack the references

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted but
I don't think it's very likelynor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case I know GA Wells takes
this position but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed  And he is a professor of German not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus

Jim Lippard              LippardCCITARIZONAEDU

Evidently Jim thinks I am arguing an existence' issue  It should be clear 
from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only 
to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim  The argument against the
messiah claim is not weak maybe mine is but in the hands of pros it is not

There are indeed two passages  The short one cannot be used to validate the
messiah claim imo  That's why I refered to the long which can be used  It 
flatly states Jesus was the Christ and mentions the crucifixion 
resurrection and Christian belief in said claims

The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother   brother of
Jesus who was called the Christ  emphasis mine and that's it 
If original Josephus has merely reported what some people say  It is nothing 
more than an observation one which lacks the Christian fundamentals

The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons  its way out of
context  Origen evidently knew nothing of it and  its rather inconsistent
with the short  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as 
insert and I see Jim agrees  Consensus is usually reflected subtly as in
Elaine Pagel's Gnostic Gospels p  A comment attributed to Josephus
reports emphasis mine  As for  I mentioned in my original post that 
the long is a rd century insert more properly postOrigen as Jim notes

There may not be consensus on the short  The text which discusses James in a
legal role stands with or without it  That it does not upset context makes it
difficult to argue insert  On the other hand an inpassing insert is easily
disguised in any context  Nonetheless on historiographical grounds it is 
worthless for the messiah defense and that's why I didn't mention it 

I don't know about the Arabic ms  If you have a translation reference Jim
please let me know  As for its much less gungho tone obviously the date 
of this ms is critical  If after ca AD  a watereddown entry in lieu 
of removal can be easily explained

Dear Rob

When I read Brian K's postings I find someone who is honestly seeking
the truth  When I read your response here I see condescension  When you
reply to a post reply to the post you quote  This statement undermines
any good points you might have had it was enough to make me stop reading

Sometimes I do come across condesending and I am sorry I come across that
way at times  Thank you for the reproach I really do appreciate it  I'll
try to get better

Rob at the same time I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle
approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke  Brian K so far
only responds to the latter  And I am glad he responds at all   In both
cases of approach  my intention is to be loving  I am making no excuse
for myself if I am coming across condesending  I apologize for that

Rob sometimes Brian K comes across as honest I know this  But Brian K 
vasillates back and forth  One post looks honest the next is
an excuse  Now he wants me to explain the universe in  words or less  
I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with
his set of excuses  

I just want Brian K to be honest with himself  If he really wants
to know he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing to do with my God   I wish Brian would read the
Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation to mock God

From my perspective Rob when I look at Brian Kendig I see a man
standing out in the middle of a highway  Off into the distance I 
see a Mack truck heading right for him but Brian K is faced away
from the oncoming truck  He doesn't see it   Here's is how I see
the dialog


Me  Brian K please step aside before you get run over 

BK  There is no truck

Me  Turn around at look

BK  No

Me  Look  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck

BK  No Explain to me why trucks exist

Me  Turn around or you will run over

BK  No I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday

Me  You blind fool  Why do you choose ignorance You have nothing
      to lose if you look  But if do not look you will certainly lose your life
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road

BK  It is my life to lose  I rather not look
      Besides a truck running over me will not harm me
      And by the way I really have an open mind


So is my motivation to belittle Brian or to love Brian the best I know how   

I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out  Because millions if not
billions of people fall into the same category  Perhaps all people
fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives  I have
I can now see the truck behind Brian

My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the
truck coming towards him  My hope is that Brian will want to step out
of the way  My fear though  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself
to the middle of the highway where he will certainly get run over  But if
he so chooses he so chooses and there is nothing I can do beyond that
to change his mind   For it is his choice   But at this very moment
Brian hasn't gotten even that far  He is still at the point where he
does not want to look  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me but his
head will not turn around to see the entire picture  So far he is
satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance 

Thank you again Rob for your reproach  I really do appreciate it  My
wife tells me the same thing at times      I will try to do better

My apologies I really didn't have the time to chase down a slew of
references from  years ago when I was looking at these issues
The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city
Despite some pious legends the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
especially after centuries of political instability and terror the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of When studied with
a
knowledge of cult psychology Acts is eerily familiar especially today

 The mother church did disappear at the time of the Roman attack James
the Just was judicially murdered a few years earlier but there is
evidence that the church survived him There is no evidence that it still
existed after the assault on the city The individuals historically
associated with that church disappear at that time 

 The followers of Jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknames
suggested connections with the Jewish terrorism of the time Zealotes
Iscariot Sons of Thunder

 For cult psychology there's an extensive literature

 For an understanding of the motivation of the members of the Jerusalem
church there is a mixed collection of sources The Anchor Bible has some
interesting articles but one thing I've noticed about biblical
scholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach are
notably lacking You basically have to spread your net wide and then
winnow For example Allegro and Schoenfeld have some interesting ideas
but they were both over the top Many interesting ideas have not been
followed up mostly due to religious reasons What was the connection of
early Christian theology to Samaritan dualism and protognosticism See
Stephen's speech in Acts for a Samaritan interpretation of the
crucifixion Schweitzer's interpretation of Jesus's motivations could be
updated especially now that we have the Essene and Chenoboskian
materials And so it goes For instance the convincing statistical
evidence concerning the authorship of the Pauline materials has been
completely ignored by biblical scholars

I don't track this area much any more My coursework is  years old I
have a personal theory that the synoptics were written in Syria during the
course of the Jewish Revolt I suspect Mark was written before the fall of
Jerusalem as an apology to get the Romans and Romansympathizers off the
back of the local Greek Christians Matthew and Luke were written with
similar goals but incorporating additional materials Given the evidence
in the Gospel of Thomas Chenoboskien I suspect Q came from a Samaritan
protognostic milieu In any case they were written in an environment
cut off by time or circumstances from Jerusalem not expecting further
contact and not wanting to be connected by outsiders to the themes of the
doctrines held by the Jerusalem church

Sorry about the lack of documentation but the time is hard to find

Would you consider the word of an eyewitness Peter to testify to the
events surrounding Jesus' life

No  There are two problems here

Brian Kendig writes

 Peter died two millenia ago  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust  If he were alive today and I could

Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great Tilgrath Pilisar III
Nero Caligula Josephus Cyrus the Great Artexerxes   Their documents
have decayed to dust too  Brian why another excuse 

 Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago
that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is God
might just be Satan trying to convince everyone that he's a nice
guy or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
today

Peter wrote a bit of the Bible  What Peter says about God is what
the Bible says   


Consider the Bible a court recording  Over the period of thousands of
years various people come up and testify of their experience with the
living God  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher  Up comes Moses
once the high official of Egypt  Up comes Elijah a priest  Up comes
David a mere shepherd who became King  Up comes the pagan King 
Nebuchanezzar  Up comes the pagan King of Persia Cyrus  Up comes
Nehemiah cupbearer to the King of Persia  Then Matthew an IRS agent
takes the stand  Up comes Luke an MD  Then Paul a Jew who use
to kill Christians for fun  Up comes John a  year old boy  Up
comes Peter a fishermen  Up comes James the brother of Jesus himself
Up comes hundreds of others  You hear testimony from fishermen IRS
agents priests Kings  The court hearing lasts thousands of years
with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself
I am 

While you are listening to all this stuff you realize that
King David could have never known John Solomon could have never known
Matthew Nehemiah could have never known Peter  You realize that all these
people are independent witnesses and so you rule out collaboration  Yet
all of the witnesses tell of the same God   Each testifier tells
of his own experiences with the living God  Each experience is
different but each experience has enough crossover to unmistakenly
reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God
What Daniel did not know about God the rd Highest Official of
Babylon God revealed to John  years laterbut with a different
perspective  No two testimonies are identical  Each testimony
dares to venture off what is already known  Yet each witness's
testimony even though different from those prior consistently
describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God  

Now  As we stare gazing at the computer you got this seeming fanatic
on the other end of the net saying I know this God  I am  He has
revealed himself to me too  He also calls himself Jesus John 
Please believe me  I am telling the truth  It is wonderful to know him

Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness 
Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from
shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer
programmers fiction  With a scoff of your keyboard with near
complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that
that is all complete hooey   Would that not be the most audacious
display of arrogance  Do you actually think you know better than
King Solomon King David or even Abraham Lincolnr

	And therefore conclude that the argument that Well it would
be better that the baby NOT be brought up under poor conditions makes
no sense and is in fact a very egocentric point of view  

Scuse please are you under the impression that this argument is made in
a vacuum and that somehow only the fetus' potential life is being considered

I would guess from your 'very egocentric' comment that you do not in which
case I have to ask just what the hell is wrong with egocentrism when one is
making a fundamental choice about one's life  Don't you consult your
own wants when you make decisions about your life  I haven't noticed you
asking me about what I want from you

I've got some great ideas  If egocentrism is ruled out you can show up
tomorrow am and I'll put you to work

Discussion on Josephus inserts

Thanks  Am I correct then in assuming that that Josephus
did in fact write about Jesus but Christian copists embellished it

Correct overstates the case  The whole point of the discussions
has been that it is reasonable to assume that there was some brief
reference to Jesus that has been doctored  By consensus this is
the most reasonable of the proposed solutions  but not so much
so as to rule out complete fabrication

How does one falsify any origin theory For example are a forever existing

Guess you must have slept through all the recent excitement when the
COBE experiments confirmed a prediction of the Big Bang theory Superstition
resolves contradictions by postulating new miracles and it just kinda sorta
looks that way apparent age  hence it never makes predictions Science
resolves contradictions by changing the theories involved

Too bad your programming does not allow you that luxury

You sound absolutely convinced Tell me how long did it last what color

I learned that God loves his children who have never heard of him and has a
plan for redeeming them too even those who have died without a knowledge
of Christ  I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on
his death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse  It
requires faith in Christ proven by following him by keeping his
commandments  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed

So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross
 
Paradise and salvation are not the same thing  Salvation is better  Refer
to John 

	I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise 

	Rather I see implied the fact that only those who are saved 
may enter paradise

Plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say values are
relative   Accuracy is a value judgement too  It so happens I agree with 
the substance of what you say below but it's clear to me that at least 
some values are objective  Truth is better than falsehood peace is
better than war education is better than ignorance  We know these things
if we know anything

And what is better Better is a subjective value judgement

I tell you a lie and as a result you give me all your millions of dollars
of assets and move to India From my perspective falsehood was a 
substantially better than telling the truth How do you think a
log of gurus make a living

I attack your country in war kill everyone and take your rich
natural resources Before I did this I was living in poverty
Looks to me like war was much better than peace

I see no need to go any further Once you address this little issue
of betterness being nonrelativistic we can continue

  I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes

I share Dennis's outrage over a similar manner  I have recently become aware
that my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries
suffered by Christians  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums
may be used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is divine
punishment for their sinful conduct  In addition these folks are able to
avail themselves of such alternative therapies as Lourdes Fatima
Morris Cerullo Benny Hinn etc  In any case as Jesus Saves' I feel
that there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my
expense  I would like to request that I be exempted from Christian
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly

Brian Kendig writes

If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a good thing
then I would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert me
Be warned however that I've heard all the most common arguments
before and they just don't convince me

Ask Jesus himself  He himself said why in John   It
isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for
a persuasive argument   Read Jesus's own reply to your
question

John  Most assuredly I say to you unless a grain of wheat
falls onto the ground and dies it remains alone but if it dies it
produces much grain
  He who loves his life will lose it and he who hates his life in
this world will keep it for eternal life
  If anyone serves Me let him follow Me and where I am there My
servant will be also  If anyone serves Me him My Father will honor

Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one

If we were created by a deity why would that deity not wish us to
enjoy what he has given us

Why would I want to live forever  The challenge in my life is that I
will die and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have
before that happens  My time is here and will someday pass I will be
content to live on in the memories of my friends and once they too
are dead then I will no longer have any reason to exist

In short even if your deity does exist that doesn't automatically
mean that I would worship it  I am content to live my own life and
fend for myself so when I die I can be proud of the fact that no
matter where I end up it will be because of my actions and my choices

If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this then so be
it  I would much rather just cease to exist  But if your god wants
my respect and my obedience then it had better earn these and if it
does then they will be very strong and true

Jesus gives more reasons in John   But one obvious reason
why Jesus died and as with everything else it has nothing do with
his punishment was that he could rise to life againso that
we would stop doubting and believe John   The fact
that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
from the dead  It is an obvious point  Do not overlook it
Without this obvious point I would have no hope
and my faith would be vanity

Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead  I think it was
Osiris who did the same as well as a few characters from Greek or
Norse legend if memory serves

But still WHY would I want to rise from the dead  Why do you want to

Why did Jesus suffer in his death  Again ask Jesus  Jesus
says why in John    That's no mystery either  The
world hates him without reason  It is a direct proclamation
of how far we humans botch things up and thus how much we
need a Saviour

If your god wants to win my devotion then it knows what it can do 
provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind
faith that could be applied equally well to any religion

And why can't you Brian K accept this  How can you  The
world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows
him  John 

That's precisely it  I neither see nor know Zeus either nor Odin
Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus

The animosity and the lack of knowledge
that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is
very convincing testimony of the truth of John  and 

You've got to understand my pointofview I see Christians spouting
Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that
will level all opposition  Truth is it's not  Robert has never
demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply he
just rattles them off day by day  Some brazenly fly in the face of
common sense and reality and I point these out where I can

But even more than that even when Christians do try to explain the
verses in their own words they do so from a Christian point of view
which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only
he or she understood the Christian message properly and then all
strife and suffering on the earth would end  Here's the problem with
that substitute Moslem or Buddhist or Satanist instead of
Christian and it means the same thing

Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book  But if
you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD
you've got some convincing to do

I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of
knowledge I am not perfect either  But regardless of that I thank
God that Jesus revealed himself to me without whom I'd also be
bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very
Person who created me and who loves me

And in my opinion you're bumbling about blindly making up entities
where there aren't any and depriving yourself of a true understanding
and enjoyment of your life  As long as you keep your beliefs to
yourself I'll keep my beliefs to myself  but as soon as you start
waving them around expect me to toss in my opinions too

                            n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent
    The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis autre
     is that it ends                                            Rousseau

I responded to Jim's other articles today but I see that I neglected
to respond to this one  I wouldn't want him to think me a hypocrite
for not responding to every stupid article on trm

mmwunixmitreorg James Meritt writes
From my handy dictionary
dictionary definitions of not disagree and agree deleted
Please operationally differentiate between not disagree and agree

Oh but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of 
red herrings and smoke screens

Let's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today
through the 'discord' filter a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont
was kind enough to send me

	Taking action A white geese be held
	as an accomplice to be held as
	a decision upon the door
	A black and white goose waddles past
	the eyes of the door 
	Hits it with the confidence interval for 
	that individual is held responsible 
	for that that individual 
	may be held as a 
	getaway car may be held 
	as an uncountably large number 
	of the driver of something 
	and agree

	A black goose 
	waddles past the person imprisoned

	White goose waddles past the 
	confidence interval for the population 
	of geese be axed 
	fine
	And white goose 
	waddles past the door

Does running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more
coherent  Less coherent

Or has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angstridden poem
about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty yet being
held responsible for the choices we make  Do the geese symbolize
an inner frustration with ambiguity a desire that everything be
black and white with no shades of gray  Does the getaway car
tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our
being is not to get away from responsibility for our actions
but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice the
driver of the getaway car as it were  Does the juxtaposition
of man and machine car and driver reveal a subtext an internal
conflict between determinism and moral responsibility

Or am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and
a random number generator

In article rayCJAKDEnetcomcom raynetcomcom Ray Fischer writes

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
I'd say that compromise seems to be better

And I would agree   But it's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it's
merely a matter of taste  Is your liking for peace any better founded
than someone else's liking for icecream  I'm looking for a way to say
yes to that question and relativism isn't it

The problem is Frank that you are bringing your own subjective values
into the debate and on the basis of those values you are making claim
to something that there is not any evidence that I've seen anyhow to
support This is not unsimilar to those people who make claims to
supernatural gods not on the basis of fact but because it makes them feel
better to think that they can minipulate their environment by influencing
those gods It may be comforting but is it real

If you are going to claim that there is an absolute or objective morality
the very first thing you have to do is demonstrate that morality itself
exists as something more than an abstraction Only when you have done that
can we progress to debating whether this morality is absolute or not

There have been many claims that morality is a component of reality but
then again there have been plenty of claims made by different folk over
the centuries Claims without fact to back them up are ultimatly very
hollow things

So having said that I would ask you to begin by demonstrating that morality
is other than just an abstraction Care to meet the challenge

	But we're talking about the government  Some want item  others item
 etc  There will always be something someone doesn't want to fund

	You don't like abortion  Work to recriminalize it  But as long as it
is legal you really don't have a chance in getting funding stopped
permanently

 This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
 nervous because it has exposed a real scam

	What scam  I'll never have a hysterctomy sp but it's a legal
procedure and my health insurance company will pay for it  Shall I now argue
that I should be exempt from those fees
	Great exept now I'll pay more since it's primarly men who have
prostate procedures  Not to mention the extra cost of keeping track of who
wants to pay for what

	If it bothers you that much start your own health insurance company
that doesn't pay for abortion

	This is a free country you know

 If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
 abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
 to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
 coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

	So don't get coverage through that company  Simple

 A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder
 for reasons of conscience  

	Sources

 If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all
 anymore then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for abortion
 coverage if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs  Or are we
 going to start forcing Jews to eat pork Quakers to fight in wars etc

	No but I imagine you'd have them pay to fight wars wouldn't you

 No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto loyalty oath in support of
 abortion in order to gain access to health care ESPECIALLY if one's
 conscience is so obviously against the practice of abortion

	So don't buy health insurance from that company  Simple

Theory of Creationism MY theistic view of the theory of creationism there

the heavens and the earth

Too bad you're starting off with a faulty translation Try this instead

When God began to create heaven and earth  the earth being unformed
and void with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God
sweeping over the water  God said Let there be light and there was
light God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from
the darkness God called the light Day and the darkness He called

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money

It is always cheaper to kill children than to take responsibility for
them  Why stop at birth why not fund infanticide up to age 

One can't help wondering just how many children YOU have taken
responsibility for

Hmmm

     C'mon Rob  If there is one argument that is ridiculous concerning
abortion it is that prochoice should imply federal funding for abortion

 Hi all
 
 I'm going to try to do something here that perhaps many would
 not have thought even possible  I want to begin the process of
 initiating a literary critical study of the pornography posted on
 altsexstories to identify the major themes and motifs present
 in the stories posted there  opening up then the possibility of
 an objective moral evaluation of the material present there  

First off let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about You sick
perverts you are immoral you are all going to hell which seems to be the
usual religious post found on the altsex hierarchy  Hopefully you won't
get flamed either

You will however be argued with  I personally think that your project is
built on unsteady ground

First I do not believe that there is any way to find an objective morality 
Morality and value are inherently subjective  they represent the beliefs of a
person or a group of people  They can be widely held perhaps even
overwhelmingly held but they are never and can never be objective

 Assumptions
 
  A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True comes
 Truly from God 
 
  Regarding altsexstories  While perhaps even from an
 objective standpoint the majority of its material is indeed
 repugnant you come to this conclusion quite quickly when you
 start thinking about analyzing its material like this some of
 it reflects some fairly profound needs in people as well as some
 truths  and deserve to be pointed out

Second I do not accept the assumptions that you make here  If as you say
you are trying to be objective then why accept a morality to begin with by
using the Christian Bible  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so
 
 In the long run the advantage of making such a literarymoral
 analysis is that it will save bandwidth between Christians and
 non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of
 the stuff on these pornographic groups

Third call me a pessimist but you won't stop the flamage  There will always
be people who pop upin altsex to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we
all are  Just out of curiosity do altsex readers show up unprovoked in the
religion groups to tell you all that you are narrowminded censoring
overbearing totalitarianists
 
 Basically there should not be a dissonance between a Christian
 morality and a nonChristian one  Either there is value in a
 particular work or there is not whether one is a Christian or
 not

Hm  Let me provide an example  Four people get together over dinner to
discuss morality you me a rather conservative Moslem and a sociopath  I
start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with
you  You agree but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of
your own gender  Just a note I really don't know your views on
homosexuality I am just using this as a common view of morality for the
purposes of this example  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to
have their faces uncovered

The sociopath who has become bored kills all three of us and eats us but
feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind 
                                                                         
 In support for the first assumption
 
 The Christian scriptures say this

	Evidence deleted

I'm not going to accept your evidence for this  You ask us to accept The Word
of God that everything good comes from God  This is only a valid argument for
a person who shares your beliefs

Still I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could
be interesting for other reasons than yours so good luck with this next part

                                                                        
              
 
 NOW THEN what are some of the major themesmotifs in the
 pornographic literature on places like altsexstories  These
 are some that I've been able to identify  Please addcomment on
 them
 
 
 Motif   THE MALECINDERELLA  
 
 In so many of the stories there is expressed a feeling of
 alienation and worthlessness on the part of the writer or
 otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object the
 other person of hisher desire Often a story involves a
 protagonist who on the surface is quite average but underneath
 usually has an enormous dick who desires to in some way to gain
 access in a definitely sexual way to the other person who
 heshe confesses is far more desireable than heshe is and who
 indeed seems to walk between the raindrops   

Hmmmdo I detect just a wee bit of condescence here
                                                      
 
 Motif   A CELEBRATION OF INDEED PREOCCUPATION WITH BEAUTY
                                
				not very objective 

 The vast majority of pornographic literature deals with beauty
 be it innocence somehow about to be lost grace or simply
 physical beauty  And generally most people Christian or non
 will say that beauty is good 

One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better or more
good than nonbeautiful people  I would hope that people relize that this is
not necessarily true
                     
 
 Motif   ONE'S DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION  
                    
      Might I suggest the word penis It seems more in line with the tone of
your post 
          
      Blessed are those who are wellhung for they shall get
      laid  from what would thus be a revised Matthew  
 

Bravo  I respect you and your sense of humor sir 

 
 Motif   SEX AS AN EXPRESSION OF SINCERE GIVING  
                                                  
 There is often enough a clear desire on the part of the
 protagonist to give definitely sexual pleasure to the object
 person of hisher desires
                                                 
Yes and this theme is usually what the better stories are about  However
they are not always selfish  I could point to examples in the work of Elf
Sternberg for example

 
 Motif   ALTSEXSTORIES DESCRIBES A SEX WHICH IS COMPLETELY
 REMOVED FROM THE REALM OF TRANSMITTING LIFE  
 
 So removed is sex from its procreative dimension on
 altsexstories that one begins to wonder why sex even involves
 ejaculation as in the context described in pornography it serves
 then no real purpose  

It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies it affirms the
virility of the male involved as well as assuring the reader that he the
character has orgasmed                      

 The Whole Picture TM is probably very well described by the
 Catholic teaching on this Of the husband and wife in an act of
 total mutual selfgiving in the sexual union cooperating with
 God in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life
 cf Humane Vitae  

Your Whole Picture TM unfortunately only applies to people who accept your
church
         
In addition if sex is for procreation then

	Why did God make it pleasurable so that people would want to do it
rather than building it in as instinct
	Why did God make it fallible  Not every sexual encounter results in
pregnancy even among Catholics  Does this mean that they have sinned
 
 In any case altsexstories and the Catholic teaching will
 probably not see eye to eye on this for a long time
 
Granted

 
 Motif   SEX USED AS AN INSTRUMENT VIOLENCE POWER AND
 HUMILIATION  
                                   
 Why pornography seems to tend in that direction I really do not
 know  Probably volumes could be written on the relationships
 between sex and powerhumiliation  But this probably gives good
 reason why traditionally JudeoChristianity has been so negative
 with regard to sexuality  it seems to tend to a great moral
 morass 

Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for
it  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real
life but will think about and read about and mull over

Later

In case you weren't clear on the concept insurance works because it

For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
Jim and I Jim wrote the following to me in email after I pointed out

Hate to shatter your self image of perfection that  you appear to hold but
your language is wrong Jim and me

I pointed out that I did in fact agree that both Robert Weiss and
Jim Meritt took quotes out of context  Hence I find it difficult to
understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite  Needless to say I don't
have time to reply to every article on trm that takes a quote
out of context  

Of course not  just the ones you disagree with  QED

So according to you Jim the only way to criticize one person for
taking a quote out of context without being a hypocrite is to post a
response to every person on trm who takes a quote out of context

Jim replied by saying 
Did I either ask or assert that

But today we find four articles from Jim one of which has the subject

So  As of then and pointing out a specific instance  Wrongo again

Is it not the case that in the eyes of the law when someone is aware of
something and has the capability of taking action and does not that individual
may be held responsible for that action

Which is of course a complete red herring  Taking quotes out of
context isn't a crime  I don't have time to read every article on
trm and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all

So  Check the newsgroups

Does silence is concurrence imply that Jim thinks that because I
didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes
out of context  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
question read what he has written and decide for yourself

Telepathy again  You claim to know what I want

But back to the context of my conversation with Jim  Jim's next 
gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
concluded that I was being a hypocrite  I challenged him to provide
the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion

No  YOu asked specifically what was wrong with yours

Today we find another obscure article posting it twice didn't help

Maybe to the ignorant  I accept your classification

More red herrings  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
number of my articles  

Do you know what uncountably large means  It does not appear so

Could Jim mean that because I axed his articles
but not Weiss' articles he wants to conclude inductively 
Well I can't see where he is going with this

I am not suprised

But I can help him with his induction  I've written roughly 

That does not appear to be the case  The appearance of your Argument
is more like that Captain Kirk would have gotten from Mr Spock  written
by a stagehand at Paramount

Think hard about this Jim  See the pattern  Think harder  Run it
through your induction engine and see what pops out  

Of course  You appear arrogant  So  I already had figured that out

Summary Spit out the lukewarm


In article CJzzGpanixcom mlspanixcom Michael Siemon writes
 Well the whole point of making these the base commandments is that
 they aren't reducible to rules  A set of rules is a moral code or a
 law code or an algorithm for acting  Such things can be very helpful
 to individuals or societies  but not if they are used instead of a
 personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions 

The two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are
so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning  Michael
Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution
of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural
assumptions that are independent of these rules
 
  The Great  Commandment is more than anything else a call
 to act as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility
 in your every action 

The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed
in part as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if
he has ultimate responsibility Indeed many traditions present
an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret
loving one's neighbor as following various other rules and
relying on their god to make things come out right precisely
because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate
responsibility Once again we are confronted with good sounding
goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean 

  Conservatives may twist this act as if you were God to 
 mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them
 as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules  They are so
 insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a
 lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such 
 idiocy IS how God acts 

And who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  There
are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward
reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way
Michael cannot refer to base claims or base commandments to
show that such readings are twisted because this divergence in
understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base
claims and commandments  In addressing conservative Christians
Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions
that these conservative Christians will reject  

 But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system since our
 society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do  It
 may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems
  in which case I will profer the agapate allelou once again

But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  a
principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems The meaning of
these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular
and cultural notions that the believer brings to them from how
the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of
other Biblical passages from a particular sectarian tradition
or from some combination of these things  These commandments
lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for
criticizing ethical systems  What meaning they have comes from
the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments 

 And different bodies of Christians have from the beginning urged
 different ethical systems or in some cases none  As a result
 it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular
 or infamous with Christianity  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH
 It does not have a QU'RAN  Specifically Christian scripture has very
 little if anything in the way of commandments  so little that
 the Christians who desperately want commandments go mining for
 them with almost no support  The one single thing in the gospels
 which Jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love
 one another

Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law which
would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what
it means to love God and love our neighbors  There are many
parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are
straightforwardly read as ethical commandments  The Pauline
epistles are similarly full  If it is not clear that these all
come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior
the problem is not a lack of raw material 


 I am a radical Christian only in that I take the gospel seriously

No Michael the conservative Christians also take the gospel 
seriously  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the
gospel

  Why don't I and the myriads of other Christians like me
 tell you something about Christianity 

In a sense the wide variety of interpretations does tell us
something about Christianity  It tells us that the New Testament
authors left a sufficiently vague hodgepodge that it can serve
as the source text for many vastly different beliefs about the
nature of the Christian god and about what men should and
shouldn't do 

The irony here is that there is nothing in Christianity per
se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and
gays  Every Christian principle he turns to this cause is
effective only through the extraChristian principles through
which Michael interprets his religion and the homophobes apply
the same Christian principles with equal justification to
their cause  In short it is the extraChristian principles that
make Michael's Christianity beneficial and I suspect they would
be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by
Christian interpretation  

Michael paints a picture of standard American atheism as the
rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian
interpretations of the Bible  But I think it is even more
damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents
such a vague hodgepodge of notions about the nature of God and
the nature of the good except of course when it is ordered by
an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles  Here I
think we should apply a Christian parable where a cold drink can
have its value and a hot drink can have its value but the
lukewarm we should spit out

 Not so in PA  Recently the gender inequity in auto insurance was

You take LSD and it skews your perception of reality You come down
and your perceptions unskew

 One wonders just what people who ask such questions understand by the term
 objective if anything
 
I consider it to be a useful fiction an abstract ideal we can strive
towards  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string it doesn't
actually exist but we can talk about things as if they were like it and
not be too far wrong
 
 How could striving toward an ideal be in any way useful if the ideal 
 had no objective existence

Wow  An actual point

A perfectly efficient power station would convert all of the energy in coal
into electricity  There is absolutely no way we can build a perfect power
station it's an ideal  But striving towards that ideal is undeniably useful
and valuable is it not

OK let me narrow the question Is it useful to strive toward a
nonexistent objective ethics In what way

Here is someones biblical claim for the characteristics of Satan

This is probably the portion of Scripture that you were talking about Isaiah 
This does speak of the morning star which according to you is the
Babylonian prince  OK so I turn your attention to Daniel   This passage
concerns a revelation of prophecy to Daniel by the messenger from God  Within
this passage the messenger from God speaks of how he fought for  weeks 
against the Prince of the Persian Kingdom  Obviously this prince was not an earthly
prince  This prince of the Persian kingdom is probably one of the demons
in Satan's hierarchy  As such the morning star can be the prince of Babylon w
ho can also be Satan  Another passage concerning Satan's fall from heaven is 
Ezekiel 

And separately

devil chose to try to become greater than God
he wanted to sit on God's throne
when the devil was created he was one of the most beautiful angels in heaven

We have here three distinct claims concerning the results of the devil's
decision making a specific desire and a physical description  Now in
support aside from the minor detail that an author seldom writes an unbiased
account of the opposition we see

Isaiah 

ISA   How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer son of the
morning  how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken
the nations

ISA   For thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend  into
                                              
heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit

also upon the mount of the congregation  in  the  sides  of the north

ISA   I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I  will
be like the most High

ISA   Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to  the  sides
of the pit


Doesn't say sits on God's throne  Says will exhault throne above the stars

Daniel 

DAN   Then said he unto me Fear not Daniel for  from the
first  day  that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to
chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard  and  I am
come for thy words

DAN   But the prince of the kingdom of Persia  withstood me
                    
one  and twenty days but lo Michael one of the chief princes
                                        
came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia

DAN   Now I am come to make thee understand what  shall be
fall  thy  people  in  the latter days for yet the vision is for
many days


See who is being discussed


Ezekiel 

EZE   Son of man take up a lamentation  upon  the  king of
                                                     
Tyrus and say unto him Thus saith the Lord GOD Thou sealest up

the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty

EZE   Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God  every  pre
cious  stone  was  thy covering the sardius topaz and the dia
mond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the em
erald  and  the  carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy ta
brets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that  thou
wast created

EZE   Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have
set  thee  so thou wast upon the holy mountain of God thou hast
walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire

EZE   Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day  that  thou
wast created till iniquity was found in thee

EZE   By the multitude of thy merchandise they  have  filled
the  midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore
I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain  of  God  and  I
will  destroy  thee  O  covering  cherub  from the midst of the
stones of fire

EZE   Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty  thou
hast  corrupted  thy  wisdom  by reason of thy brightness I will
cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that  they
may behold thee

EZE   Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of
thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffick therefore will
I bring forth a fire from the midst  of  thee  it  shall  devour
thee  and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight
of all them that behold thee

EZE   All they that know thee among the people shall be as
tonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be
any more



Anyone else to make a claim about the characteristics of the devil

Put like this I can't answer I was originally pointing out that your
attitude seemed to be I don't know if it really was that chemists
tend to ignore all kinds of effects your original posting stated that
when doing chemistry it is common to ignore atomic interactions and
I responded that this is exactly what chemists do

 Has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years

Perhaps this revolution has yet to reach Cambridge my now I'll get
flamed for sure  But perhaps I am guilty of referring to 
true chemists tm which are nothing but my ideal and do not
actually exist Chemistry is a very easy subject to treat poorly

 Perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that I was thinking of organic
 chemistry whereas you were thinking of physical chemistry

No actually organic chemists were among the first chemists to use
modern MO theories for explaining reactions that did not fit into the
old models In synthetic organic chemistry which still comprises
a large part of organic chemistry it is indeed common to ignore
the rest of the molecule and pay attention only to the functional
groups but I think this too has changed with the advent of
molecular modelling and asymmetric synthesis Supramolecular 
interactions can be taken into account albeit with difficulty

Anyway I don't have anything against AMORC I just wanted to point
out that secret organizations are lead by human beings and we all
know what that means

I had an ehum interesting experience with the Rosicrucians or at
least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday They had advertised that
they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King  the room
of the heart which rhymes in Swedish Out of curiosity I went to
the lecture

There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians one
woman and two men apart from me The Rosicrucians were male both of
them First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium
Rosicrucianum which was founded in Harlem NL in  He read
straight from a piece of paper which I at that point was because he
lacked experience in talking in front of people but the other guy
read too and he was used to holding speeches I could tell The
first guy also said that the Rs are a mystical Christian order and
that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars
English from the thirteenth century

The other guy took over reading from his piece of paper in a
fairytale teller's voice What he said sounded like a load of crap to
me Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something
What made me a bit suspicious was the way they first said that we all
contained something divine and could find our way back to divinity
then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently
but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss Maybe I've
read too much RAW but it sounded very much like the things he talks
about in the chapter How to robotize people and brainwash your
friends in Prometheus rising 

It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians The one holding
the actual lecture obviously was top dog and the other one seemed to
be a true believer I got the impression that the top dog had more
distance to the faith than the true believer that he used it to gain
power and admiration He spoke like a fairytale teller whenever he
remembered

 Yes do see item  in the sciphysics FAQ file  The mass is only
 fundamental and invariant under the new definition  Since most people are
 more familiar with the old definition of mass I claim it's reasonable to use
 the old definition when posting to altatheism

Referring to the rest mass or what I would just call mass as m

The new definition is decades old Anyone who has worked with SR
since then would be familiar with it If most people are familiar
with m  gamma m a highly questionable assertion anyway I would
expect it is on the large part due to learning SR from lousy
popularizations instead of proper textbooks

 In particular as the FAQ points out with mass redefined as a fundamental and
 invariant property E is no longer mc  I suspect that using the new
 definition would cause more confusion than it would remove

Why should we require E  mc even when p   Because it's cute
Saying m  gamma m adds confusion For example people might think
that the formula for kinetic energy still works if m  gaamma m ie
KE   gamma m v  Wrong In fact it's gamma  m c
However if you say p  gamma m v you always get the right answers

In the end it does boil down to a matter of definition You and I
both know what is going on and that is invariant To say that
things actually get heavier when moving fast relative to the observer
misrepresents what is actually going on it is better to say that
momentum  velocity is observed to increase according to an external
observer

But people who haven't studied SR properly will still make mistakes
or miss the point regardless of what you call mass

  You need a gravitational field to curve space not speed relative to
  what
 
 I didn't say it was the speed that was curving space

Yes you did From Irusnewswwmantiscouk

 Again things get tricky when they move fast  Objects get heavier space
 gets curved and reality generally fails to live up to one's expectations

Summary In response to Dave Davis


I wrote
 And who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  There
 are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward
 reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way

In article rcccassmabullcom ddaviscassmabullcom Dave Davis writes
 This requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally
 valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among
 them I wouldn't make that assumption I don't think it is a
 reasonable assumption 

No  It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice of
interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by
the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully
determined by scripture  Whether or not there is some right
interpretation matters not few Christians claim the ability to
read the mind of their god  Dave Davis should note that it was
Michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural
influence in this thread  I think Michael is right in this but
regardless it should be noted that this has not been a point
of contention between Michael and myself 

I have argued  beyond Michael's claims  that the Christian
scriptures are open to so many interpretations  including a
wide divergence within the Christian tradition  that even their
most important themes are vague  Again it does not matter that
there is some right interpretation unless there is a way to
determine what that right interpretation is  It is the lack of
an objective measure not the presumed lack of an answer that
puts the force behind the line I argue

 Michael and I and others read 'the Bible' with Christian
 glasses Among the things that this should imply is that the
 NT informs the OT even to the point of dominanting it Some
 points in the OT ceremonial  dietary laws are explicitly 
 abrogated by the NT texts 

There are enough Christian glasses varying over a sufficiently
broad range of color that I can find a few that support my
example 

 No Michael the conservative Christians also take the gospel 
 seriously  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the
 gospel

 Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced not to say inappropriate
 Michael's selfdescription must govern  The equation of radical  
 liberal which seems implied by Russell Turpin is wrong 

In my opinion what makes Michael radical is that he fully
acknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to
determine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity
hold dear  He is willing to live and practice his religion
within this indeterminacy and he is willing to acknowledge that
much of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by
ideas that are not purely Christian  Those Christians I have
called conservative must also interpret but they do not
recognize  or at least are unwilling to admit  the extent and
importance of this

 Russell Turpin in an earlier post had said that Michael Michael's
 theological positions actually didn't tell him much about Christianity
 Dean Simeon responds this time gently 'What do you mean' More
 direct perhaps would have been 'What could you possibly mean'
 The implied rhetorical effort to separate Michael from the tradition
 is a failure Michael is in the tradition If your idea of the tradition
 doesn't include him Change your idea of the tradition

I recognize that Michael is part of the tradition  But what does
it tell one about a tradition covering Origen Aquinas Jerry
Fallwell and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon
Not very much

  In short it is the extraChristian principles that make
 Michael's Christianity beneficial and I suspect they would
 be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by
 Christian interpretation  

 This conclusion does not follow even in short from the
 argument that goes before A surprising logical ellipsis

I think the conclusion does follow  The purely Christian
principles that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in
the Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian
scripture  These necessarily vague are not enough to drive his
political stances  That one should love one's neighbor is a 
purely Christian principle  That this means showing tolerance 
for homosexuality is not

As to these political stances they are often at odds with what
is commonly held in most of current Christendom and so I 
suspect they could be better pressed outside it  On the other
hand I can well understand the counterpoint that these 
political stances become most influential when presented to 
those who need them most


 This is a theological statement worthy of Barth
 Dr Turpin DD may wear the black robe of Geneva yet 

Having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science I
doubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon

 And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that heshe
 simply disbelieves that the proposition is true is the only one who
 holds no burden of proof  This is why the socalled weak atheist
 position is virtually unassailable  not because it stands on a firm
 foundation of logical argument but because it's proponents simply
 disbelieve in the existence of Gods and therefore they hold no burden
 of proof  When you don't assert anything you don't have to prove
 anything 

Right Why should I assert anything about beings that I don't believe in
When I have no good idea of what this being is like only some 
contradictory statements being made by various religions I cannot 
firmly assert anything specific 

A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist
However we will first need a definition of 'god' and the theistic
religions do not agree very well on this Did you see my earlier
posting on the existence of god Theists cannot even agree whether
any god exists or metaexists or is herself the existence 
Omnipotence omnibenevolence and omniscience are other concepts
theists do not all agree upon Thus it is hard to assert anything
about a such fluxional beings Deus absconditus remains hidden
from those who believe and from those who don't 

 That's where weak atheism draws its strength  But its
 strength is also its Achilles' heel  Without assertionsaxioms one
 has no foundation upon which to build  As a philosophy it's virtually
 worthless  IMO of course

I have to disagree here  first philosophical maxims are not necessarily
something to build upon What can I build upon Occam's Razor for 
instance Weak atheism is not a philosophy a philosophical system
There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from
ranging from reductionism my choice to objectivism Actually
philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of gods

Second your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles'
heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me and is actually a version
of the oftheard theistic claim that 'but even atheists have to place their
faith on something even if it is not god' This has been discussed in
the FAQ but from a different viewpoint and I do not repeat it

I think one does not have to take anything on blind faith
True one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer
to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all however It is
probably the simplest assumption one can make after solipsism
of course

   Am I correct then in assuming that that Josephus did in
 fact write about Jesus but Christian copists embellished it

In article Aprulyssesattcom mlsulyssesattcom Michael L Siemon writes
 Correct overstates the case  The whole point of the discussions
 has been that it is reasonable to assume that there was some brief
 reference to Jesus that has been doctored  By consensus this is
 the most reasonable of the proposed solutions  but not so much
 so as to rule out complete fabrication

It is worth noting that the dozen or so references to Jesus
outside of Christian scripture provide us no evidence of what
he taught or what he did beyond the fact that the early
Christians claimed him as their founder  All of the writers must
have received their information from the early Christians
perhaps second or third hand  None of these references give any
hint that the writers had any independent information about
Jesus 

These references do show that the early Christians were having an
influence at least enough to earn a few lines here and there in
other peoples' writings  But the typical use to which they are
put by some Christian apologists in making psuedohistorical
arguments a la Josh is totally specious

These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
direct witness to God's existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
alike

Sorry if this is late for the thread but

I thought God was supposed to be constant and neverchanging  How do
you reconcile this common Christian view with the paragraph above

Also while we're at it

 How do you reconcile A KIND and LOVING God with the
JudeoChristian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable
by death  Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing
KINDness and LOVE

 Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of
having made a mistake

 Now that we are living in the age of grace does this mean that
for our sins God now damns us to eternal hell after we die rather
than killing us immediately  If so is this eternal damnation an
example of A KIND and LOVING God

Just curious

 Here tis  Someone just told me that the Old Testament books were translated
 into Greek a long time ago
   Yes that's a famous version called The Septuagint  It was a translation
made by Greek Jews
 and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon afterward

No

   I don't know what you're referring to here  When the Jersusalem Temple was
destroyed some manuscripts may have been lost but I think our extant Hebrew
manuscripts are as good as our Greek ones I don't know about any originals
The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks
had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscriptsscrolls
and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated 
perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions or perhaps just
as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes
in power groups heI dunno

No The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever
built in the world The Greeks had a love of wisdom philo sophos and
this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library The Christians 
got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems 
invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling 
into Moslems hands far more likely since they were the book burners not the 
Moslems or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it 
Either way a tremendous amount of information was lost The destruction of the
library of Alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man
against man

 So I was just wondering since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must 
have had copies of the earlier Hebrew versions is the Hebrew version of the 
 Old Testament very different from the Greek derived version
   No  There are a few famous discrepancies Isaiah's prophecy about a young
woman was changed into a virgin which was how the New Testament writers
read it but not many

Actually the Hebrew almah young woman was translated as the Hellenistic 
Greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the
modern and technical English term virgin The Jews did not have the type
of virginity cult that the GrecoRomans had in Artemis and Diana

Well perhaps this is the answer then

   If you go to a Jewish bookstore you'll get a Bible translated by Jews so
there will be some differences in interpretation but the text they're 
translating from is basically the same

The standard text used by Christians and Jews is the Masoretic Text
Jews of course use the text in its original Hebrew without translation

   If you want to read the original you can buy an Interlinear Bible  That
contains the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament with an English
translation written underneath each word
   If you want a Bible with a possiblymoreoriginal basic text you can try
to find a Samaritan bible  Good luck  I've never seen one The Samaritans 
no not the Good Samaritans have their own version of the  Books of Moses
They claim the Jewish bible was altered by Ezra

Propaganda

Thanks for the tips  Now I just have to find someone to teach me Samaritan

  Again things get tricky when they move fast  Objects get heavier space

Yeah and I was claiming that speed causes disappointment too 

Thinking about it a much more interesting distortion would probably be the
visual effect of having the universe seemingly compress itself into the front
of your field of view and frequency shift all over the place which I seem to
remember is what happens at those speeds  At least you'd see it unlike

I understand from the newsmedia that the Whitehouse has stated that
the fire which withered Mt Carmel was started by the Davidians

I wonder how you know that  The word of the FBI  Well I guess you
have to take someone's word

But it seems to me that no one knows for sure what was pumped in yet
Or what some folks on scene might stoop to or what bureaucratic or
tactical mistakes might have been made All being washed away

One way or another  so much for patience Too bad you couldn't just

Don't forget when all seems lost God's mercy is there for you no 
matter how guilty or corrupt you've been Not quite humanly logical 
is it


PssstLet me let you in on a little secret  Clinton is not responsible for
the death and injuries that took place in the Mt Carmel camp on Monday
Neither is Atty General Reno  The issuance of tear gas might have not been
the best idea to achieve the extrication of the Branch Davidians but
previous attempts through negotiation had fallen through and the FBI had 
said that this was to end asap

One person and one person ONLY is to blame for this Vernon Howell aka David 
Koresh It was he who issued the order to start shooting at the BATF agents 
when they went to serve the arrest warrant on Feb  It was the Davidians 
who KILLED four law enforcement agents and injured several others It was 
Koresh who refused to peacefully walk out of the compound and fight out the 
legalities in a court of law with a jury of  citizens note I can't say
a jury of his peers as his writings indicate that he thought that he was 
Jesus It would be pretty difficult to find that many selfappointed prophets 
in the North Texas area

As for who started the fires in the building there have been numerous local
news reports with interviews with some of the rescued people stating in fact
their own people were starting the fires  Once again it wasn't Reno 
or Clinton who lit the matches in this It was Vernon Howell The only people 
in the building I feel sorry for are the children who perished in the blaze
as they had no choice in the matter The rest of them had every chance

So Steven please scrape up your pennies and nickels and go buy yourself a

The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian
may not be Christian

WOW Are you serious So not everyone who calls themself a Christian is
a Christian WOW That does make things a bit more complicated doesn't it

I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they do and what they say

That seems like very good advice given the above revelation

If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus
Christ then they are NOT Christian

Like for example Matthew  right

If they have not repented of their sins
and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are 
NOT Christian

Um where did Jesus say that he wanted people to worship him

These are the only criteria to being a Christian

So do you adhere to the Ten Commandments

  I would not find this statement to be very useful since it is an appeal
to authority and the opposition will just claim that their authorities are
better  A second tact that local creationists have used is to reply but
those scholars are atheists and cannot be believed they will also use this
phrase to describe any theologians that they don't agree with

 If you are paying for a phone and you don't want callwaiting YOU DON'T
 NEED TO PAY FOR CALlWAITING

 If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
 abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
 to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
 coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

Why the hell would somebody named Dennis be paying for
abortion coverage at all  Why aren't you also complaining that
you want your insurance premiums reduced because you won't be
needing that pap smear coverage

C J Silverio	cjsgicom	ceejwellsfcaus

How would someone named Dennis be stuck paying for abortion
coverage  if abortion is put under a catagory of a general
medical procedure  You have to ask the insurer Would my policy
cover an abortion to find out  If it does you should have a
right to decline that coverage if YOU DON'T WANT IT

The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for the
coverage YOU WANT  If basically you want catastrophic coverage
you get a policy with a high deductible with a correspondingly
LOWER premium  Similarly you don't have to be COMPELLED to
take on a policy covering things like liposuction or hair
transplantation if you DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE again
at a corresponding savings to you

If you don't want to be covered for abortion you should not be
COMPELLED to  To millions of Christians abortion is not a
gynocological examination or a pap smear  To them abortion
is murder  To them being covered for abortion means that they
are paying for a service which THEY THINK IS EVIL CLEARLY
DON'T WANT and will NEVER USE  In such a case all that is
happening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHER
PEOPLE'S abortions

When you are being forced to BUY something you DON'T WANT and
will NEVER USE this is called extortion

When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to buy a jukebox for
the owner's protection this is called racketeering 

And if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing a
defacto loyalty oath in support of abortion by promising to
help pay for other people's abortions when one is clearly
opposed to this procedure this is tantamount to the same thing

 If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that 

 	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to
 man How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of
 established religion is anything other than social convention One
 way is to assert that there are moral universals But that is not
 the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen
 to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties

 What right do
 we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality

 	We expect empathy from our fellow man We expect to raise each
 generation with values that we live by those which assure that mistakes
 we have made are not repeated Do you think that mere authority checks
 all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life I think not In fact
 authority is power and power corrupts The most powerful tend to think
 that they are above the law that applies to everybody else Religious
 authority theocarcy has not mitigated this any better than other
 power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no
 checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses
 recorded by history are greater

 	We live and teach morals by setting an example starting in
 the home This does not come from books or authority figures in
 soceity If people are weak or confused at the present time it is
 not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some
 mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas
 will repair That is but magical and simplistic thinking We need to
 look at forces in the way we live even the good things that happen
 in our present culture that are weakening the family as the primary
 means we have to teach children values Of course people are trying
 to have the community do things that once were done in the family
 alone This may not be as effective We need to look at this



 	Laying down the law and with teeth doesn't stop the crazy
 man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law It
 may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact but it
 may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people
 from murduring

Bruce

   It seems like you are advocating social change based on your
concept of human nature and that concept seems pretty Utopian It's
obvious from even a cursory study of history that no system
regardless of the authority it may claim for its basis will make
people act any better Until human nature changes the products of our
nature won't change and that has to include society I think your
assessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic

   What is needed is an absolute moral standard if all people are to
create any Utopias By implying a Utopian future you also argue for
an absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case I realize
that you may not acknowledge the connection but it's there

        It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from 
       the FBI and that independent observers ie the press were not 
       allowed to get close and see things for themselves  Official 
       communiques tend to be selfserving for the agencies that issue 
       them 
        People in general tend to believe first reports as these get 
       the most and the biggest headlines  Corrections are often 
       overlooked 
         An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found 
       in the rubble had bullet wounds  The local coroner who is 
       independent of the FBI has so far found no bullet wounds
Brian Ceccarelli wrote that's me

 Kent I am not accusing you of evil things  Jesus is accusing you
 And it is not only you that He is accusing  He is accusing everyone
 Me you and everyone in the world is guilty  Whether one
 sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with 
 whether we do evil things  We do them regardless  

Kent Sandvik responds

 Hmm it seems that this is the core of Christianity then you 
 have to feel guilty    

I think I see where you are coming from Kent  Jesus doesn't view
guilt like our modern venacular colors it   

Feelings have nothing to do with guilt  Feelings arise from the state of 
being guilty  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive  Feelings are a 
reaction from guilt  Jesus is talking about the guilt state not the 
reaction   Let me give you an example

Have you ever made a mistake  Have you ever lied to someone  Even a
little white lie   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really 
didn't know  Have you ever hated someone  Have you ever been selfish
Are you guilty of any one of these   The answer is of course YES  You
are guilty  Period  That is it what Jesus is getting at  No big surprise  
Feelings do not even enter the picture   Consider Jesus's use of the word
guilt as how a court uses it

Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being
imperfect  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners  We all do
bad things  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our 
guilt that we are all sinners     It is it in our nature to do bad things 
We are sinners therefore we do bad things  Being a sinner is fact  It is
not a pleasant fact  But it is just a fact  We are not perfect   Calling us
sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a
human being  Guilty as charged

 and then there's this single personality that will save you from this
 universal guilt feeling

You can handle your guilt in one of two ways  Acknowledge you
made a mistake learn from it and try to not do it againin
the meantime not punishing yourself for it  which is the
way Jesus wants you to handle or it  This is the healthy way

Or two the destructive way  put yourself down slap yourself
and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to
say a thousand Hail Marys    even to suicide  This the way 
Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it   All people fall into this 
category to some extent in their lives

Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt
feeling  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he
loves us despite our guilt  Jesus knows we are guilty  That
isn't new to him  It is no big deal to him He just wants you to realize 
that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him
That is what he wants you to know  Why because he wants to 
have your company  You are immensely valuable to him
Jesus wants a relationship with you however in our present
sinful nature we are incapable of having this relationship  

God is perfect  We are not  You cannot fit a square peg into
a round hole  However God has provided a way for us to
change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him
God has provided Jesus so that whosoever just believes in
Jesus will have their nature changed  The Holy Spirit will
move it  And now divine nature is now within lives our very
beingand us and God communicate with each through his
unifying Holy Spirit  The benefits of this are endless  For
with the divine nature living within us we can now see
our imperfections better  We can now head them off at the pass  With
the power of the Holy Spirit living in us we now have his power
to help us overcome our shortcomings   Because the divine nature lives 
within us we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before
we could understand  Because the divine nature now lives within us we now 
have authority over demonic forces  And lastly because the divine 
nature now lives within us we have eternal lifefor the Holy Spirit
is eternal

The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance  Because
it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to
heavenly kingdom it is your relationship to the living God
Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he
separated the goats from the sheep   Many people in the
last day will ask him Didn't I prophesy in your name and do
miracles and do good things in your name   And what did Jesus say
Depart from me for I never knew you  That is the cornerstone of 
Christianity Kent  Jesus must know you as his friend  It is your 
relationship to Jesus  If he is your friend and you are his you will
be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven  

 Brian I will tell you a secret I don't feel guilty at all
 I do mistakes and I regret them however I've never had this
 huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder

Good  It shows that you have a strong selfimagethat you
love yourself  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus
taught  If only more people could do as you do   As I said before 
in the common english venacular feeling guilty has a
different meaning than the state of guilt

 This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
 personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
 religious doctrines And if your personality type is 
 opposite then you are not that easily attached to a certain
 world view system

I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego
a lot less selfcenteredness and a lot more unconditional love

 There are humans that subscribe to the same notion The nice
 thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden
 the shoulders feel far more relaxed

Yes  You have stated what Jesus said  Remember  Come to me
take my yoke upon your shoulders for my burden is light  A yoke
is used to direct oxen to do work  Once you have a relationship with 
Jesus you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life  Having 
God at your side is of great advantage
  Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
  How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference
 
 Which goes faster a bullet or a snail  How come you can answer that when
 Einstein proved that there isn't an objective frame of reference
 
 Not that Einstein proved anything

Oh yes he did  You may not agree with his premises and what he proved may
not apply to reality if such a thing exists but he certainly proved
something

                                        but you can't answer it and your 
 answer be in general true

Got it in one  Similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral system
to be better than another in every possible circumstance  This does not
however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another
in a specific set of circumstances  Nor does it preclude a set of moral
relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of
circumstances which they all agree they are in

OK this makes sense to me  I'm serious you've explained something
to me which I never understood before  But just for grins suppose we
almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality  What
then  Or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame
of reference in which thus and such is good isn't that approximately
objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to
outrun a snail  For example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area
isn't it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even
though there conceivably might be some tailend case that would justify it

                             And even that statement assumes an
 objective reality independent of our beliefs about it

Eh  Could you explain this  Which that statement are you talking about

My own above you can't answer

  And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
  it isn't an objective reality for values
 
 I'm sorry I can't parse an objective reality for values  Could you try
 again
 
 san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face
 of disagreement

I still don't quite see what you're trying to say  I assume by values you
mean moral values yes  In which case what do you mean by real  What is
a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one

I mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand
by a horse being real is pretty much what I mean about a value being real

 If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in
 your opinion then all you get is infinite regress

Sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  It looks extremely finite
to me

I meant that it's never more than your opinion  You've clarified this
for me above  My understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists
agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference
then they're saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes
no different than what I'm saying

                                                    What you do not get
 is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
 is inferior to that of the man of peace

Sorry but that's not so  I can provide a justification for asserting that
the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace  I
just can't provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances

Logically possible or actually possible  By which I mean are you
stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal
switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you
think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is
superior to peace  Really what I'm after is some order of magnitude
on the probability you put on 'possible'

From whose point of view would you like to know what relativism concludes 
One of the people involved in the argument or some third person observing
the arguers

I've just come from responding another of your posts where some pennies
have dropped for me  But it would clarify further if you would answer
from the point of view of any disinterested observers  perhaps an
observer as likely to be in position A as in position B where A and B
disagree in the future and have his or her conclusion now binding on
them at that time

    Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see 
  how
  anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original 
  mass 
  that formed is forming the black hole in the first place

    Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever 
  faster towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space 
  caused by the excessive gravity as the object approaches the event 
  horizon 
  it has further to travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach 
  the 
  event horizon of   
  infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

It seems to me that you are misusing physical intuition here  My point is
that you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomena
inappropriately  Remember that there is no such thing as a global frame
of reference for time  Our minds like to pretend that there is and we 
imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx  years off 
from ours on Earth
This is simply wrong  There is NO global time which can be applied to
events on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth  This is what
Special Relativity has taught us  If I am travelling past the Earth at
a high rate of speed toward AC I can even have a different view of the 
order of the occurance of events on AC versus Earth  Thus the answer to 
the question what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW is NOT welldefined if
asked on Earth until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relative
velocities and the like AND it will have different answers for different 
values of these parameters
Now in the vicinity of a black hole the curvature of spacetime becomes 
important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes 
very important  In particular the frame used by a distant observer is quite 
different from the frame appropriate to the falling object  Our minds just 
don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be 
behaving differently in these two locations but the equations of relativity 
say that it does  We would like to say the falling object is hovering
above the horizon NOW for an object whose frame has rotated wholly away
from ours  In a very real sense once the object has fallen into the hole
its gone forever from our ken  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it
that is

Frank relativism is not keen to make such judgements unlike

Maybe I should not mention the 'magical word' that describes

 is a law requiring all or even some ethnically Tibetan babies to be
 aborted Just how many are we talking about Hundred Dozens One or two
 You are aware of course that even in the days when the one child policy was
 enforced the Tibetans and all other ethnic minorities were exempt Of course
 you do And you are aware that if the Chinese wanted to kill all the Tibetans
 they have lots of better means and they have had a rather long time in which
 to do it But for some reason there seems to be more Tibetans now than at any

  actually nonsense but it's a perfectly good model for predicting all kinds

 Your original posting shows that you seem to think chemists still think
 this way It is true that basic chemistry is still taught in terms of
 electron pairs and valences but this is not what chemists are taught

 I suggest you take a look at PW Atkins's classic text Physical Chemistry

chemistry whereas you were thinking of physical chemistry

As I hope you can tell b and c are actually predicated on

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable  The concepts of right
and wrong or correctincorrect or truefalse belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions  It makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good or better than another position

Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics  perception and motivation respectively
One can certainly ask if a percept is right correct true
veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory  But it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false  On the other hand it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil but one can
certainly ask that question about motives

Therefore your suggested answers ac simply can't be considered
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment

True by correct I mean the thing valued is really good  I should
use evaluative terms but I don't always  Sorry for the sloppy phrasing
Can you answer if betterness is used in in place of correctness

Now the problem with d is that it is doublebarrelled  I agree with
the first part that the rightness of a moral position is a
meaningless question for the reasons stated above  But that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication not an implication at all that
one cannot feel peace is better than war  I certainly can make
value judgments bad better best without asserting the correctness
of the position

You can never say that the thing is really better or more likely
to better from all realistic frames of reference


Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ad  My short e answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue
neither is right correct or wrong incorrect  They simply hold
different moral values feelings

This is where my difficulty arises though I'm starting to get
in now  The thing is there isn't anything simple about different
moral values when those values are human rights

Jim  we essentially agree except about the definition of fact
The scientific definition of fact is not the ultimate truth but
rather a theory which is so supported by evidence and so predictive

So we have the fact of evolution and we have theories of evolution
just as we have the fact of gravity and theories of gravity and
the fact of the atomic nature of matter and atomic theory  The fact
of evolution is that the current diversity of life arose through
common descent  this is so supported by the evidence that no one ever
bothers to try to test it anymore  Theories of evolution include
theories regarding the mechanism of common descent natural selection
vs drift or the actual pathways of evolution or any number of
other things  These are constantly being tested because the actual
mechanisms etc behind the fact of common descent are still up for
question

Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory  In other words it
could theoretically still be falsified and rejected  But since it's
so predictive and so consistently supported by evidence it seems
pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore

Both are very useful models that

Here is where you fail to make an important distinction  You have

Ordinarily it is also a value judgement though it needn't be one 
could do science without believing it was worth a damn in any context 
though that hardly seems sensible
No you're just overloading the word value again It is an
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth
Shit I don't even know what worth means Consider the possibility
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value
science at all 

But once you make a decision on the value of truth and the likelihood of 
science getting it the rest follows  In your example science is necessarily
worthless and so are its results because truth is worthless assuming that's
all science is good for  And it's no accident that phrases such as good
for fit so naturally in this context

Just because evaluating an arithmetic expression
and asking how much you value life both involve the word value doesn't
mean that they refer to the same thing at all I understand that
the word value is used for both but you have to be clear in what
sense you are using the words I agree with judging science as a
value in the first sense but not the second

But I don't use it in the second sense  Consider that Fma is no 
different than F until I note the connection with reality that Fma has and
F does not  I'm making a decision as to the importance of Fma
over other expressions I can compute  I'm valuing it whether implicitly or
directly because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality
are different to other things which do not  And noone points
out an unimportant difference except to say that it's unimportant
Important useful worthy etc are all words with evaluative
power quite different from evaluating an expression  I'm careful
to use value in the sense I mean which is invariably the first

I don't understand your point here What do you mean by not quitesure
observations It gets observed all the time that if you don't
buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is
done the results become meaningless 
Well how do you know that it gets observed all the time  This
is your own private subjective it is it not    It is not binding
on the rest of us
Huh What are you talking about People frequently point out the
point I made above That is what I mean by 'observed'

OK I misunderstood  I thought you meant observed in the sense
of 'notquitesureobservations' by which I mean those undertaken
by people

DES does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either
This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which
accepts  bytes and uses the first  to ECB the second 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics
The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in 
the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent  Such a box 
may as well be assumed to wear a dufflecoat and go to the Limerick Races
Truth by blatant assertion again Frank It's observationally the
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations

Yes it does  You're saying in effect it works independently of what I
believe and basing that statement on your reasonable assumption ie 
unsupported belief that it works indepently of what you believe It
begs the question rather obviously  And of course reasonable
assumption seems to be weasel words for seems useful useful
belonging to world of ghosts and values and therefore being unreal

No I don't see what the popularity of a value has to do with whether
it is objective or not Pls explain
If almost all people agree that the sun exists in the usual uncritical sense
and almost all people agree that  a deal is bad  it's a reasonable 
conclusion that the sun really does exist and that the deal really is bad
I disagree completely Until rather recently most people did not
believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb Popular
opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact
True but nevertheless the basis of all matters of fact is overwhelming
popular opinion and some overwhelming popular opinion is fact the
sun shines  If it were not so physics would be a personal matter
assumed to be different for each of us  There would be YourGravity and
MyGravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict
both  
This is simply complete nonsense The basis for 'matters of fact' is
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is

The basis Eric is people peering at the world and saying what
they see  I'm talking about uninterpreted facts  observations  People
do those  Agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory
that is more than personal

about raw observations the dial reads  matter in other words though 
they can surely be mistaken or even lying there too I saw the statue 
move  Getting to theories from raw facts is certainly errorprone but
one assumes that the raw facts are usually as reported otherwise science
is impossible  
Opinions about 'raw facts' as you call them are somewhat different
than interpretations of those raw facts

I know this  You know this  Can we proceed

Now I take an experience of goodevil to be every bit as raw a fact as an
experience of pain or vision
That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says

You're not comparing apples with apples  If we all look at the same meter
we'll agree  If we're all in the same situation that's when we'll
agree on fundamental values if at all  People who say that nobody agrees on
values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem
to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either

  For me an ethical standard can be nothing
more than a hypothesis about the modification of observed value through
human actions It will be better if  You ought
See above We can't seem to agree on what's better

See above  We sometimes can  There is also the matter of inertia
against experimentation  Most if not all moral hypotheses are necessarily
tested by way of thought experiment  Few people will attempt genocide
or experience a lifetime in jail to find out if it's really as bad as 
all that

   In that context
then I see the choice as being between scepticism relativism and 
objectivism  IMO the existence of supermajority experiences of
good life freedom truth peace love intelligence testifies that
objectivism is true for fundamental values  and this in turn is weak 
evidence that objective ethics may be possible
I don't see that it's any evidence at all
As I point out above I'm really not interested very much in
what the popular opinion is I'm prepared to trustto some extent
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
because by and large they accord with my own However if everyone
else said the dial read  and it looked like a  to me I would
hope that I would believe myself Ie believing other people about
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
what I would believe if I observed myself but the possibility exists
that it is not Since I know from observation that others disagree
with me about what is good I believe I can discount popular opinion
about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually

Firstly if everyone else said the dial was  and I saw  I'd check
my lens prescription  Secondly your observation that people
disagree shows nothing  people may be looking at different things
by virtue of being in different situations  If I look at an elephant I'll 
see an elephant  That doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you 
look at an iguana    Thirdly I question your assumption that when
people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals that 
they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals that seems to be the 
disagreement you refer to

 You're admitting a lot more than that  You are admitting that

 how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions

 For what it's worth  and yes I know you claim to be an agnostic 
 it's this ability to relabel things from immoral to moral

 From my reading I discovered that this is not yet possible and may not be
 possible in principle  The reason is that every case that comes to trial
 is unique with its own collection of special facts  It is beyond human
 power to specify all the possible circumstances that may bear upon a case
 in advance  We have to judge each one on its own merits and simply take
 the formal law as a guide  The law is an ass we must be careful to use
 it as a beast of burden and not expect anything more from it

Just as well then that I'm not claiming that my own moral system is
absolute

Jon

and I thought to impress with my references

Ok so you don't claim to have an absolute moral system  Do you claim
to have an objective one  I'll assume your answer is yes apologies
if not

Objective means is that different observers will get the same results
The observers may need to be trained in the use of the system  I'd be
interested in seeing a summary of your system though I appreciate that
it might take a great deal of effort to put it in writing

In your post above you objected to situational morals  Perhaps you
could begin by explaining how you objectively set the situational
boundaries of an act in your system  I don't think you can do it
Here's a game we could play that would illustrate my point  I think of
a situation and you have to say whether it is moral or not and why
In your move you can

	 Ask me any objective question about the situation or
	 Pronounce judgement

After you have pronounced judgement I get to add whatever context I like
to the situation provided I don't change anything I have already said
If I can change the context to one where your objective system would give
a different answer then your system is faulty  Since I don't know what
your system is either you must write it down or at least be consistent

Do you think your system could pass this test

I hate doing this because it's been done so many times before but

Evolution in the nonscientific sense is change  Although it is
often used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tend
toward higher complexity and ability evolution simply implies change
for good or for bad  In the scientific sense evolution is merely the
change in allele frequencies for a given population over a period of
time  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss the
scientific fact of evolution  We observe such shifts in allele
frequencies occurring all the time so it is trivial to conclude that
evolution is a scientific fact

The mechanisms that enable such changes in allele frequencies are
collectively known as the theory of evolution  Darwin's natural
selection is one such theory  Genetic drift is another  Gene flow is
still another

Evolution is a fact and a theory  I posted Larry Moran's lengthy
article on this topic a couple days ago  Why don't you go back and
read it

The doubt that has infiltrated the previous smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology has inflamed passions  There is lack of agreement
even within warring camps  Sometimes it seems as if there are as many
variations on each evolutionary theme as there are individual biologists

Niles Eldridge yes he's a paleontologist Natural History Evolutionary
Housecleaning Feb  pg 

So

Of course he's a paleontologist  He's also an evolutionist  In fact
I'm damn glad he's made it apparent that evolutionary biology has the
ability to adapt to new lines of evidence and to develop new theories
Otherwise it wouldn't be science it would be something like
creationism

So when should we expect your next outofcontext quote John E King
Do creationists like yourself ever use anything other than appeal to
authority to support arguments  Like science maybe  I guess not
And they wonder why they can't teach creationism in science

What is the fact of evolution  There is a difference between calling evolution a

the latter is more accurate   And you said it best yourself If you assess

you want to argue about something that you do not know anything about

This discussion on objective seems to be falling into solipsism Eg the
recent challenge from Frank Dwyer for someone to prove that he can actually
observe phenomena  Someones even made the statement that science is
subjective and that even atom are subjective This is getting a bit silly
and the word objective is losing all meaning  Lets start by remembering the
definition of objective which has been already presented

  objective ADJ  Of or having to do with a material object as 
    distinguished from a mental concept  Having actual existence
    a Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice b Based on
    observable phenomenon

The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that
thing eg the world is objectively round regardless of the fact that there
exist flat earthers but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable
phenomenon instead of being based solely on peoples wishes feeling mental
processes etc  Thus atoms being based on very observable and repeatable
phenomenon are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective 
Even weird high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon even though
that observation can change the outcome  Nor are those observable phenomenon
affected by emotion or personal prejudice eg chemical reactions do not
change to the whims of different people  Thus to say that science is not
objective ie objectively verifiable is a bit silly as that is the
point of science  Now I will agree that science is not objectively good I
will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective 

Now some examples things which are objective  A D tractor is larger
than the average breadbox  Chlorophyll is green  Seawater contains salt
There exists ozone in the atmosphere at least presently  Ozone blocks 
ultraviolet light  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer

Good on the other hand is a value judgement  It doesn't seem to have an
existence apart from what we give it unless someone can objectively show the
existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined good  We cannot
quantify it touch it or collect it in any concrete sense eg I have a bag
full of good  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word good an
objective meaning eg  good has been used to denote strength resiliency
speed etc  That though is a subjective definition as some might not see
strength and etc as necessarily good eg strength inspired by Naziism 
is not generally viewed as good 

As to a morality I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based
on verifiable observable phenomenon  The closest I have seen is some form of
the Golden Rule which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss
people off as they will likely then involve themselves in your life in a
manner you won't like  This is verifiable when you get in someone's face
they will often retaliate  Another objective fact about morality is that a
more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group and thus can
at times ignore that form of the Golden Rule without fear of reprisal  Now
as to whether this enforcing of morality is good or bad is quite
subjective  By the way remember that subjective does not mean that a thing
cannot be formally stated or even commonly agreed upon it only means that
that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena or has a physical
existence unto itself  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such
thing as an objective morality or that I could not accept any such a
morality I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such
morality 

One other thing to notice objective is many times used as synonymous with
true andor absolute and subjective sometimes has the connotation of
false andor relative Tain't necessarily so  For instance when a
conclusion is based on objective but insufficient evidence then it can be
both objective and false  As to absolute it is easy to note that while we
can objectively show that TNT is explosive but that does not absolutely mean
that all TNT will explode and thus objective is not necessarily absolute
either  On the other hand something subjective can also be either
absolutist or true For instance there are some theists who are
specifically absolutist in their morality even though they have only
subjective evidence to back it up  Further many a scientist and detective
has been motivated by subjective reasons eg a gut feeling or hunch to
investigate a phenomena or situation and gather the objective evidence
necessary to support a true hypothesis  On the whole though I would have to
agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective
evidence

wrong about the whole affair  I had been a devout follower even a
Biblebanger but eventually it started ringing terribly hollow to me

And I felt torn when I began to disagree with a lot of what the Bible
and my priests told me this was what made me finally realize that
either I was very wrong or else the Bible was very wrong  And since
I felt reasonably sure of myself I decided to start analyzing the
Bible very closely  That was the catalyst to my break with my faith
though it was a long and difficult effort

Brian have you checked out what your priests told you in the
Bible to see whether they were telling you the truth  Did you know
that according to the Bible there shouldn't even be such things as
priests anymore  Do you know why the preisthood was established in
the Old Testament to begin with and the reasons why after Jesus
there were no prieststhat is until the Roman Catholic Church 
 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring
the whole concept beyond the book of Hebrews

You said you analyzed the Bible very closely  I think you are
lying  For if you had I would think you would have at least
got the doctrine of hell straight

Nonreligious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead

to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the

that Jesus was created but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss
were not  I agree that this is a heresy  So what  
The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is
not a basic Mormon doctrine  Jesus did not perform the atonement
in Getheseme alone as some antiMormons are trying to teach  
As far as the unpardonable sin whatever that is it is Biblical
and not specifically Mormon  It is also called the sin against
the Holy Ghost  Most Bible scholars other than conservative
ones do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same
I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts  I don't
know what you mean by That He needed to be saved  Jesus
Jehovah  Elohim  In Mormon doctrine Jesus was sinless
and thus did not need to be saved

 This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolut
 standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality
 are equally good
 
 Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
 How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference

Which goes faster a bullet or a snail  How come you can answer that when
Einstein proved that there isn't an objective frame of reference

Not that Einstein proved anything but you can't answer it and your 
answer be in general true  And even that statement assumes an
objective reality independent of our beliefs about it

 And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
 it isn't an objective reality for values

I'm sorry I can't parse an objective reality for values  Could you try
again

san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face
of disagreement

If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in
your opinion then all you get is infinite regress  What you do not get
is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
is inferior to that of the man of peace  Your saying it does not
make it so  and that's according to your premise not mine

The problem is that you imagine him inside this huge wall unable

have a case where relativity plays a big role concerning looking
at opposite frames of reality

Kent with regards to the information contained in the Bible which
is the original context of this thread Brian Kendig is inside a huge
wall  Brian IS inside  The Bible and the information contained therein
are outside the wall   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the
absurd things he says  For example If I get through into the firey
pit I will cease to exist  The Bible doesn't say that  He hasn't
a clue even to what Jesus said about hell  That is but one example

Now in your sense Kent of sensing realitythat is a different
matter  And to you and to Brian relativity does play a big role
What we perceive to be true depends on our vantage point  Since I
have read the Bible and Brian Kendig shows that he hasn't he has 
a narrower perspective than mine  at least in the respect
of knowledge of the Bible   I am proposing to Brian Brian come up here
and take a look from this vantage point   But Brian replies I rather
not thank you  I am content where I am  Besides the vista from up
there stinks   And in the meanwhile Brian ignores the facts that
he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same

        b mph to someone stationary next to the train

What a coincidence  That's exactly how I've experienced it too
So far
Trouble is I've no way of knowing if it is just coincidence
That is it appears to have been that way in all measurements to date
But I wouldn't go as far as saying that it will always be so  or that it need 
always be so

The reference frame makes the speed relative  But what's interesting
here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet
Every person off a bullet moving mph  

More coincidence  Wow
Still  I wish I could be sure that it was always going to be like that

 Malcolm Lee mleepostRoyalRoadsca wrote in reference to Leviticus 
 and Deuteronomy 
  These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had
  expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
  direct witness to God's existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
  is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
  Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
  God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
  age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
  repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
  for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
  alike
 
 Hmm for a book that only applied to the Israelites Deuteronomy Jesus sure
 quoted it a lot Mt    In addition he alludes to it in several
 other places Mt  Mk  Jn   And just in case it isn't
 clear Jesus thought the Old Testament isn't obsolete I'll repeat the
 verse in Matthew which gets quoted on this group a lot
 
 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets I have
 not come to abolish them but to fulfill them  I tell you the truth until
 heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke
 of a pen will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is
 accomplished  Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of
 heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called
 great in the kingdom of heaven  For I tell you that unless your
 righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
 you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven  Mt  NIV in
 pretty red letters so that you know it's Jesus talking
 
 This causes a serious dilemma for Christians who think the Old Testament
 doesn't apply to them  I think that's why Paul Harvey likes quoting it so
 much 
 
 Rob Lanphier
 lanphuidahoedu 

I will clarify my earlier quote  God's laws were originally written for 
the Israelites  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
all people not just the Jews  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
Heaven through the saving grace of God  I never said that the Law was made
obsolete by Jesus

If anything He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made  In the
following verses Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended  If you'll notice He
also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived
interpretations  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their
heads but not their hearts  That is why He points out that our righteousness
must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
of Heaven  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their
way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin
They had become legalistic rulemakers  religious lawyers who practiced the
letter of the Law but never really believed in it  

I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world a lot of
modernday Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart

Christianity is not just a set of rules it's a lifestyle that changes one's
perspectives and personal conduct  And it demands obedience to God's will
Some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  That is their
choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too

 Anyway I've often wondered what
 business followers of Christ would have with weapons
 
 Didn't Christ tell his disciples to arm them selves shortly 
 before his crusifiction I believe the exact quote was along the
 lines of If you have something sell it and buy a sword
 
 This from a guy who preached love deference of power to God and
 renunciation of worldly life in exchange for a life of the spirit If
 Jesus did in fact command his disciples to arm themselves I would
 take that as yet another reason to reject Christian doctrine for
 whatever it's worth
 

Let me clarify  In order to more clearly understand scripture one must
look in the context of where the verse is found  The section you refer
to here is found in Luke   I'd like to start back at verse  and I'll
include it here for the sake of completeness

   Then Jesus asked them When I sent you without purse bag or sandals
   did you lack anything
   Nothing the disciples replied

Verse  says  But now if you have a purse take it and also a bag and
    if you don't have a sword sell your cloak and buy one  It is written
    And he was numbered with the transgressors

Verse  says  The disciples said See Lord here are two swords
                That is enough  he replied

What does this all mean
 
In verse  Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them out
previously they did not need to take anything with them  Their food
lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others
If verse  Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in the
near future  Remember Jesus was saying these things shortly before he was
to be arrested  In verse  He tells the disciples that they will have
to take their own possessions and provisions with them  THey will have to
carry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity from
anyone  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take care
of themselves  This was implied by the reference to the sword  Jesus knew
that He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal  The charges
brought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples

In verse  we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally  It is
not the first time that the disciples got His message wrong  They had done 
this on several occassions  Instead of understanding the gist of His words
they presented Him with two swords  Jesus was perhaps taken aback by
this promptly concludes the discussion by saying That is enough

The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die  Jesus kept telling
them over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they could
not grasp this  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who would
lead them in rebellion against the Romans  That is why they were so keen on
presenting Him with the swords  They had no idea that Jesus was referring to
a different kingdom of which they were to be a part of  The disciples could
only perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven

Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion
This was clearly in evidence in Luke  when Jesus rebuked his disciples for 
using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest 
Him  As further evidence Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose

Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see that
DK was NOT Jesus as he claimed  Jesus surrendered himself to the authourities
and allowed himself to be crucified  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory but
rather Jesus was executed like a common criminal  

I hope this makes it a little more clear

God be with you

	    The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	   during the initial raid

	    The Branch Davidians opened fire first

Sigh I was waiting some some notsointelligent person to bring this
up  Look this is a country of laws To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance

 th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses 
 papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 
 shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon 
 probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and 
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
 or things to be seized 

	The first question is Did the 'tipoff' call indicate to the
Branch Davidians that a noknock warrant was in use and they could
therefore presumably go into 'Weapons Free' once the compound property 
was entered  The second question is What makes Gerry think that the
Davidians' actions would have been different had another type of warrant
been in use 

	I'd like to see both of these questions answered before seeking
judgment as to any claims about my IQ


No a noknock warrant is in clear violation of the th amendment
Okay what about the fact that they were tipped off  they shouldn't
have opened fire  right  WRONG  Think about this I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a noknock warrant So
being moronic sheep we wait with our guns holstered Now instead of
the Feds in comes my competition and we're history  The only
acceptable answer to a noknock warrant is blazing guns  I may sound
paranoid but our government is out of control and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it

	A spurious analogy especially for one so skeptical as Gerry 
The Davidians were NOT drug dealers and by all accounts feared no one
but the Feds Any evidence to the contrary

	Deleted vast quantities of carefullyannoted spew from David Koresh
	I don't know about the rest of you but I think Mr Tice needs a hobby

He has one He spent last summer telling everyone who doubted the word
of the great Perot that they were bigotted perotbashers right up to the
moment he chickened out on them He then kept quiet for a bit and then

I am avidly collecting Koresh rumours the nuttier the better So far I
have three posts in my mailbox claiming that the Warrant for the search
	 Never existed
	 Did not authorize no knock helicopters etc
	 Was completely irrelevant because the laws wer unconstitutional

I am avidly trying to locate a copy of the Book of Koresh that a number
have claimed exist

Then there is the rumour that Loresh in fact survived the fire in a secret
hideyhole and rose again on the third day only to be spirited away by
FBI agents and disposed of in order to prevent a cult following

The source of the fire is variously attributed to a deliberate act on the
part of the FBI an accident or an act of God

In the same way I really like the miracle amunition belt story The
idea being that in a just cause God will supply amunition fear not
for the Lord himself shall place the arrows in your bow Neat eh The
BATF agents were thus definitively shot by the will of God himself I
can't see why they needed the million rounds of ammo though in that
case


If you have some Koresh material that hasn't gone to the net then please
send it to me In particular I really do want to see the book of Koresh
but no making one up please I want the real Mcoy the one the Feds
discoverd on the third day in a box with seven seals and are suppressing


I will editorialize for the benefit of the net to produce a definitive

There evidently was a feast of bread and wine associated with Mithras  I
have often wondered if Yeshua intentionally introduced this ritual to
expand the appeal of his religion or if it was appropriated by later
worshipers

You could argue that if you wanted but I think a more reasonable 
argument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast was
very similar to the Pesach Passover meal during Seder a very
Jewish ritual
 
The fact that there appears to be an abuse in the early Church of
people eating too much a very real concern with some Passover meals
and not treating the meal with respect shows the simplifying of the
ritual to just bread and wine to be a way of dealing with the
inherent problems of people's human nature and trying to keep the
essentials of the remembrance aspects

kmfolks with him children and all to satisfy his delusional mania Jim
kmJones circa 

I think there's plenty of evidence to the contrary  six rescued
Davidians consistantly recounted that the Federal tank knocked over a barrel
of propane These guys haven't exactly been spending time together
plotting an elaborate and consistent story It would be contradictory
for Koresh to go for mass suicide  remember that Koresh's death was
the opening of the sixth seal  the signal that Armageddon had begun
His army the people in the compound would then fight the powers of
evil and win ending in the Rapture The fire wiped out his army I
read earlier that Koresh was planning to walk out of the compound 
and blow himself up with a grenade  that would jibe better with
his teachings

stIn the mean time we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption
stAre you surprised things have gotten that rotten

kmNope  fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption
kmfor centuries

I'd think you'd be the last one to support gassing people and 
burning them to death for their religious beliefs Corrupt Evil
I don't know We'll never know And when you start calling people 
fruitcakes about their religious beliefs that's dehumanizing people
We saw what happened when many Germans started believing that Jews
were subhuman

In one neat stroke they destroyed all the evidence that could have 
pointed to wrongdoing And killed all the witnesses including 
children whose last view of life was choking and pain followed by
burning them alive

I am extremely saddened that this tragedy occurred I'm furious that
they used my money to do it

sma real Christian unless you're born again is a very fundamental biblical
smconversion and regeneration are 'probably' part of some small USAbased cult

the bornagain tag often use it to mean very specifically
having undergone some sort of ecstatic experience which can in
fact be very easily manufactured with a little psychological manipulation
and are often insultingly dismissive of those whose
Christianity is a little more intellectual is not the result

Some of these cults which seems like a rather dismissive term
to me are pretty big here in the USA  Most of them
are quite respectable  neiborly  do not resemble Branch Davidians
in the least confusing them is a mistake  What about live 
let live folks  I'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies
who are Catholic  the antiabortion movement in the USA seems to have a
few hard cases in it for example

I've often heard such people use the line Catholics aren't
real Christians Indeed anyone sending missionaries to
Ireland must certainly be taking this line for otherwise why
would they not be content for Christianity to be maintained in
Ireland in its traditional Catholic form

I have to agree Matthew with this I have certainly encountered a lot
of antiCatholicreligion propaganda  emotion  some bigotry from
members of certain religious groups here  They also practice their
missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States but to
someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty
offputting  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot
of popular anticlericalism

Followups set elsewhere this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues
to me

  You most certainly could But you could also expect the same would happen
right back to you Every person claiming that thier decisions are not

makes humans come up with a code to follow

Indeed  But that code is law not morality  I think the point here was not

anarchistic system  Our incredibly high standard of living is based on 
technology derived from an ordered existance  We wouln't have got far if 
we were still bashing each other over the head with clubs right

The question becomes is it possible to have an ordered society in which 
the laws are recognized to be in place based on enlightened self interest 
as opposed to morality 

And secondly assuming a satisfactory legal code is in place and we 
choose to persue individual freedoms as far as possible is a moral 
code required or even acceptable

Can an agreement ever be reached  At what point do we start to comprimise

For those who think David Koresh didn't have a solid structure
or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast
 
I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon  

Other than it tells quite a lot about the Man himself 

It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most people

Are you the spokesman for most people

I've enclosed a partial list of the sources he cites or quotes
he exactly used As a Christian sermon it's pretty good if not 
inspired

Though I differ in part on some of his conclusions the argument 
he presents is well backed  which is why it's taken me this long
to work through  still ongoing 

If you thought it was rambling  that says far more about you than
it does Koresh 
 
You've made me curious  What does this say about me

That you don't recognize the Biblical commentary used  Those in the
church know the language though and have no such excuse  

First Seal in Revelation  the entirety of Psalms  and the
most of Revelation   which demonstrated one of his major points 
about how the writings in the Prophets including David and in 
the Psalms and in Revelation are all telling the same story when 
you understand how they're related ie have the key They largely 
explain each other 
 
Charles Manson used revelation as well  Do we see a pattern here
I wonder if Koresh liked the Beatles

You missed the point  which is that the Prophets the Psalms and 
Revelation all together provide a very rich view of a very special
event  a wedding

Koresh was a nut okay  Just because he found ways for the Bible
to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook

How are you able to make such a conclusion  Please note that the
first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those
in the church That said it doesn't hurt to try to see what the 
prophecies are ahead of time  for those outside the church

Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed
for the message he carried 
 
I'll type this very slowly so that you can understand  He either set
the fire himself or told his followers to do so  Don't make him out to
be a martyr  He did not get killed he killed himself

So you say It should be interesting to see what the investigators 
conclude and what the final judgments are

In the mean time we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption
Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten

The evil was inside the compound  All that thou shalt not kill stuff

So much for war and government eh

Oh yeah one last point for the believers  Philippian 
 
For the rest of us could you please post the text

Very glad you asked since I goofed  it should be Philippian  
here from NIV

	Because of my chains most of the brothers in the Lord
	have been encouraged to speak the word of God more
	courageously and fearlessly

	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and 
	rivalry but others out of good will The latter do so
	in love knowing that I am put here for the gospel 
	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition not
	sincerely supposing that they can stir up trouble for
	me while I am chains But what does it matter 

	The important thing is that in every way whether from
	false motives or true Christ is preached And because
	of this I rejoice
	
My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord are
human and imperfect Whatever we preach no matter how eloquent or
how corrupted  is of little difference Those who know the Master's
voice will recognize Him  a gemstone amidst rock Such is also the 
lesson of the stumblingblock For those who have an ear to hear

 David Thibedeau sp one of the cult members said that the fire
was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the 
facilities knocked over a lantern
 
In two places at once Bit of a coincidence that

Never lived out in the country I see  years ago I had a place
where I had to carry in propane every month hook the bottle up 
to copper line to supply both the stove and a type of water
heater called a flashheater A flash heater has a pilot lamp

Here's the point If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked 
up to copper or some such lines run through the ceiling spaces
 when the FBI started wrecking the place they could easily have
ruptured the lines Which then would start spreading out through
the overhead And since it was a country home it wasn't necessarily
built with nonflamable insulation 

It's probably more plausible than anything else that the fire started
mainly as a result of accident  or willful negligence on the part of
the FBI which should have known better ie manslaughter

It's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day  the fire
wouldn't have started

Whatever the faults the FBI had the fact is that responsibility
for those deaths lies with Koresh

So what is your beef against Jesus

First and foremost I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything
more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago  I know
your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did
but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has
any bearing on this universe or the lives in it and I similarly do
not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed

Period

I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'cultural
virus' that has been passed down from generation to generation because
people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim
responsibility for their own fate so they brainwash themselves and
their children into believing the popular myths and it goes on from
there  And eventually Christianity becomes a given  if so many
other people believe in it it must be right no

I don't believe in any life after death  I believe that when I die
I die so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose
to my life in the meantime  I don't believe that it's a good thing to
humble myself and view pride as a sin  pride in moderation is a
constructive thing  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and
nothing inferior about women and my priests lost a lot of my trust
when they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of these
opinions to me  I don't believe in 'loving everyone' especially
people I've never met while I try to show respect to everyone my
love and admiration is something not easily earned and I do not feel
guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has
abused it

If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously stop
trying to show me how the Bible makes sense  Start trying to show
me that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone's life
here on Earth

Didn't Christ tell his disciples to arm them selves shortly 
before his crusifiction I believe the exact quote was along the
lines of If you have something sell it and buy a sword

This from a guy who preached love deference of power to God and
renunciation of worldly life in exchange for a life of the spirit If
Jesus did in fact command his disciples to arm themselves I would
take that as yet another reason to reject Christian doctrine for
whatever it's worth

Like most religions the doctrine has good and bad in it  I would 
certainly reject the current implementations of the doctrine

No  The above is a classic example of taking a scripture out of context
It's taken from Luke   But note vs  For I tell you that this
which is written must be accomplished in me namely 'and he will be reckoned
with lawless ones'  He then stated that two swords were enough
for the group to carry to be counted as lawless  

So having more than the politically correct number of weapons was
cause to be arresed and killed even then huh

Jesus' overiding message was one of peace turn other cheek live by 
sword die by sword etc

Yes of course as in Matthew  Do not suppose that I have come to 
bring peace to the earth it is not peace I have come to bring but a sword

 Here tis  Someone just told me that the Old Testament books were translated
 into Greek a long time ago

   Yes that's a famous version called The Septuagint  It was a translation
made by Greek Jews

 and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon afterward

   I don't know what you're referring to here  When the Jersusalem Temple was
destroyed some manuscripts may have been lost but I think our extant Hebrew
manuscripts are as good as our Greek ones  I don't know about any originals

The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks
had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscriptsscrolls
and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated 
perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions or perhaps just
as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes
in power groups heI dunno

 So I was just wondering since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must 
 have had copies of the earlier Hebrew versions is the Hebrew version of the 
 Old Testament very different from the Greek derived version

   No  There are a few famous discrepancies Isaiah's prophecy about a young
woman was changed into a virgin which was how the New Testament writers
read it but not many

Well perhaps this is the answer then

   If you want to read the original you can buy an Interlinear Bible  That
contains the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament with an English

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT

coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

You appear to be stunningly ignorant of the underlying concept of health
insurance

Are you any less stunningly ignorant  Have you ever heard of life
insurance premiums some companies give in which nonsmokers are charged
much smaller premiums than smokers

Not to mention auto insurance being much cheaper for women under  than
for men under  because women on the average drive more carefully
than most menin fact almost as carefully as I did before I was 

As many people have mentioned there is no reason why insurers could not
offer a contract without abortion services for a different premium
The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be
lower for those who chose this type of contract  Although you are
removing one service that may have feedbacks into other types of covered
care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs

For an illustrative example in the opposite direction it may be possible
to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium  If you
add preventative services and this reduces acute care use then the total
premium may fall

  Do you consider NeoNazis and white supremists to be Christian  I'd hardly
  classify them as Christian  Do they follow the teachings of Christ  Love

  Christ their Lord and Saviour  By the persecution of Jews they are violating
  all the precepts of what Christ died for  They are in direct violation of
  the teachings of Christ  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
  of that time loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
  sins  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else
  The enemy is Satan not our fellow man
 
 In Mark  Jesus is quoted as saying Whoever believes and is baptized
 will be saved but whoever does not believe will be condemned  I
 consider most NeoNazis and White Supremisists to be Christians because
 a  They say they are
 b  They feel it necessary to justify their actions with the Bible
 

Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute
Jews  Isn't it love your enemies instead  They may say they are Christian
but do their actions speak differently  Do you believe what everyone tells
you  I don't  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions
And ultimately by my own choice  Salvation however was granted only through
the grace of God

 The Bible provides us with no clear definition of what a Christian is  It
 tells us what a Christian should do but then it goes on to say that as
 long as you believe your sins will be forgiven  

To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the
very name Christian  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in
your heart what does that say of your belief

 White Supremisists and
 NeoNazis may not be your brand of Christian but by believing in Christ
 they are Christian


White supremists and NeoNazis are NOT any brand of Christian

If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot
 see

What does this belief entail  Believing in Christ and having your sins
forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin  To
repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it
again  I am a Christian but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me
of being such then are you not prejudging me  BTW I am of Chinese racial
background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this
country  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these
White supremist Christians as you call them

Anyone can say what they believe but if they don't practice what they preach
then their belief is false  Do you concur
 
 Now for your original statement
    What bothers me most is why people who have no religious affiliation 
    continue to persecute Jews  Why this hatred of Jews  The majority of
    people who persecute Jews are NOT Christians I can't speak for all 
    Christians and there are bound to be a few who are on the antiSemitism
    bandwagon
 
 You imply here that it is predominately atheists and agnostics who
 persecute Jews  I am hard pressed to think of even an example of Jewish
 persecution in the hands of atheistsagnostics

Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention
What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial
intolerance and bigotry  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity
but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them

 About the only one that
 comes to mind would be in the former Soviet Union where many religious
 people suffered some sort of persecution not to mention many
 atheistagnostics who suffered persecution for believing the government
 sucked

and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are 
NOT Christian  These are the only criteria to being a Christian

     indication that BD's were contemplating suecide
 
     The survivors claim it was not a suecide
 
 It's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim  It is
 clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that
 BD members had started the fire

No this is far from clear  We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that
a survivor made this claim  We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who
spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did
NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire  In the absense
of any more evidence I don't see how we can decide who to believe
Furthermore its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that
some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else
With the state of the area now we may never know what happened

 
     BD's were not contemplating suecide and there is no reason 
     to believe they committed one
 
 No reason  How about these two
 
   Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the
 	corridors and set fire to it  The speed at which the fire spread
 	is not inconsistent with this claim

Again we have only the word of the FBI on this claim  The lawyers who
have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim

 
   There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound
 	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this
 	fire  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did

I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities  Its more likely
that the BD's started the fire than did the FBI  But there is currently NO
way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence
which is nearly none

 
   Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide it is very possible that
 	David Koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this
 	was not suicide  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort
 
 There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction
 
 A  They are not dead but escaped via bunkeretc  From reports of the
 	inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found I would rate this
 	as highly unlikely
 
 B  The fire was started by an FBI accident  This is possible but it would be
 	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it
 	Sure it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
 	which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
 	the day near the edge of the complex  It's anecdotal evidence that
 	has been contradicted by other escapees
 
 C  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI  This has been suggested by
 	some on the NET and I would rate this possibility as utterly
 	ludicrous  This is what we in sciskeptic would call an
 	extraordinary claim and won't bother refuting unless someone gives
 	any good evidence to back it up

   D   The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs  I am truely amazed that
        I have heard or read of no one suggesting this possibility
        With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and
        the adults wearing gas masks it had to have been chaotic inside
        I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or
        accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over  With the winds it
        would have quickly gotten out of control

 
 So we are left with two reasonable possibilities  That the fire was an FBI
 accident and that the fire was started by the BD  I find the latter more
 likely based on the evidence I've seen so far

   No I think that D is also quite reasonable  I personally can't really
asses any relative probablities to either of these  probabilities although if
forced to bet on the issue I would probably take an accident either FBI or
BD over intential setting of the fire

   I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered
had gunshot wounds  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically
denied that they've reach any such conclusions  He pointed out that under intense
heat sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and
that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is
quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard

   In short there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many
scenarios as to what happened on Monday  We should remain skeptical until
more information is available

Science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round 
as you would wish it  If there is no such thing as objective value then 
science can not objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head
Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said
to be more useful than a set of tarot cards  You like those conclusions
I don't

I think that you are changing the meaning of values here Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word

value n  A fair equivalent or return for something such as goods
or service  Monetary or material worth  Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance merit  A principle standard or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable  Precise meaning as
of a word  An assigned or calculated numerical quantity  Mus 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest  The relative darkness or
lightness of a color  The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound 

In context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best In terms
of scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing

No I'm using definition  or perhaps  in both cases  If there
is no objective worth usefulness or importance then science has no 
objective worth usefulness or importance  If nothing is inherently
worthwhile or desirable then simple theories with accurate predictions
are not inherently worthwhile or desirable Do you see any flaws in this

The problem is your use of the word objective along with values
Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective that is
they are particular to a given individual or personal You see
what one person may see as worthwhile another may see as worthless

If on the other hand some things have objective worth usefulness
or importance it would be interesting to know what they are

Again your form of measurement in this sentence that being of worth
is subjective 

If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will
be a good beginning

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful worthy or important in
dealing with observed facts  Alternatively you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful worthy
or important in any situation   In other words I need to know
how you use the term objective

When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of
that word given by another person I try to find a standard against
which to judge that usage In most cases the dictionary is the standard
I use Here is a definiton of objective

objective ADJ  Of or having to do with a material object as 
distinguished from a mental concept  Having actual existance
a Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice b Based on
observable phenomenon

By this definition science does not have an objective worth since the
phrase objective worth is an oxymoron However you asked something a 
little differently this time you asked for an objective basis for a
notion The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is
responsible for changes in our world the changes are material and
thus objective would provide an objective basis for an argument
However the conclusion arrived at from that argument that science is 
good is subjective

I think that the problem here is one of word usage Take a little time
and read the definitions of these words objective subjective worth
value morality good evil I believe that if you think about the 
meaning of them for a while you will have to conclude that there is no
such thing as an objective morality

I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me  I
really wish I could believe in him 'cos no matter how much confidence
I build up on my own the universe is a big place and it would be
so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it

Brian K I am pleased with your honesty  And to be honest as well I
believe you have not asked my god to come to you  Why do I say this
Because by the things you write on the net and the manner with which
you write them you show me that you made up your own god and are
attempting to pass him off as the real thing  I got news for you
Yours doesn't at all sound like mine  Your god doesn't come to you
because your god doesn't exist

I've gone into this with an open mind  I've layed my beliefs aside
from time to time when I've had doubt and I've prayed to see what
good that would do  I don't see what more I can do to open myself to
your god short of just deciding to believe for no good reason  And
if I decide to believe for no good reason why not believe in some
other god  Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate

I am sorry Brian but when I read your postings I do not see an open mind
What I do see is misunderstanding lack of knowledge arrogance and mockery

Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself

Be true to yourself then  Have an open mind  And so end the mockery  Gain 
knowledge of the real God  Put your presumptions aside  Read the
Bible and know that there is truly is a reason for everything and
there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond
our shallow worldly experience  A person who commits himself  
to seeking God will find God  Jesus stands at your door and knocks  But a
person who halfheartedly opens the Bible or opens it with purpose to find 
something to mock will find learn and see nothing  The only thing one
will gain with that attitude is folly

Be careful to not jump the gun for at first glance there are many passages
in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd  Be assured that even
though they seem alien at first be confident that they are not
Be assured that beyond your present comprehension there lies such
deep reasons that once you see them you will indeed be satisfied 
I will personally guarantee that one  As Jesus put it You will never
be thirsty again  Your cup will even flow over


From King Solomon  BC to  BC

    It is the glory of God to conceal a matter
     to search out a matter is the glory of kings


Jesus says in John   

   No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him


And in John 

   For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son
   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
   life


You are included in whosoever  And I also pray that the Father is
drawing you which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting
to talkreligionmisc  Remember Brian you could be a St Paul in the
making  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do but also had pleasure
stoning them  Yet God showed him mercy saved him and Paul became
on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church

You see Brian I myself better be careful and not judge you because
you could indeed be the next Paul  For with the fervor that you attack
Christians  one day you might find yourself one and like Paul
proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more

Or you could be the next Peter  What Jesus said to Peter Jesus would 
probably say to you Satan would surely like to have you  Why so
Because Peter was hardheaded cynical and demonstrated great
moments of stupidity but once Peter committed himself to a task
he did with full heart  Peter was the only apostle to have the
faith to walk on water as Jesus did

You asked Why not believe in Zeus  Zeus didn't offer eternal life
You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus

Timothy J Brent said in response to PVASILION

 But then I don't pack heavy weaponry with intent to use it  You
 don't really think he should have been allowed to keep that stuff do
 you  If so tell me where you live so I can be sure to steer well
 clear  The public also has rights and they should be placed above
 those of the individual  Go ahead call me a commie but you'd be
 singing a different tune if I exercised my right to rape your
 daughter  He broke the law he was a threat to society they did
 there job  simple

 You have no evidence that David Koresh or his followers were
packing that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that
recreational and selfdefense purposes

 Your statement that the public also has rights is correct only is
parsed as the individuals who comprise the public also have rights
There is no separate rightsbearing entity known as the public

 Since the rights of the public of which you spoke are in fact only
rights of individuals the statement that the rights of the public
should be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning

 You have artificially created an illusionary conflict of
individuals' rights when you speak of my right to rape your daughter
No person has the right to rape another person therefore there is no
conflict

 How do you define society  Do you hold that this society is a
rightsbearing entity which is separate from any individual people  How
do you define a threat to society  To what extent do you believe that
a person loses his rights when he is declared by whom to be such a
threat

Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe

The facts are what is there the processes that exist in the
present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured
in the past These facts exist with or without a theory

The theory tries and explains the facts and how they relate
to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both
coherent and useful that it can be used to make predictions

The facts of gravity evolution electromagnetic radiation
relativity atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they
behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain
how they interact or even why

A theory never really becomes a fact but a theory can predict
the existence of a previously unknown fact and if we find this
fact as the theory predicted we say the theory is supported
by the facts A theory is a mental construct a speculation 
a model  If it is a good model it may be useful

In science a theory is something that is supported by the 
evidence considerable evidence sometimes all of the evidence
A hypothesis is a new fledgling theory because there is not
yet enough evidence to support it  When a new hypothesis 
is proposed to replace an existing theory it must explain
all of the facts that the current theory explains and at least
some of the facts that the current theory could not andor
predict new facts

It is so simple I'm surprised that this subject gets
beat to death about once a month A quick glance in a dictionary
would clear up  of the confusion and bandwidth in this
newsgroup  Then we could talk about really important things
like why do men have nipples

In article CztJuFKxnewscsouiucedu cobbalexialisuiucedu Mike Cobb writes
 Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus  I realize it is 
 normally tossed out because it contains miracles but what
 are the other reasons

Far from being tossed out the gospels are taken almost
universally as the primary source of information about Jesus
I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring  Who tosses out
the New Testament  Undoubtedly a few naive atheists do this
but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb
ascribes this more broadly

Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is
why except for some naive believers who unfortunately far
outnumber nonbelievers both naive and critical are the gospels
not taken as gospel truth that faithfully records just what
happened two thousand years ago  This has an easy answer and
the answer has nothing to do with miracles no text is taken
this way by a critical reader

There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text
measures it by some set of criteria and then either confirms the
text as historically valid or tosses out the text  I suspect
this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and
secondary school where certain texts are vested with authority
and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present
historical arguments along these lines for their religious
program  In fact most texts used in primary and secondary
school history classes ought to be tossed out even the better
such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed
above and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if
it bit him on the keister twice

Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts
and their use in studying history  First all texts are
historically valid  ALL texts  Or to put this another way I
have never seen a notion of historical validity that makes any
sense when applied to a text  Second no text should be read as
telling the gospel truth about historical events in the way
that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and
secondary school  NO text  This includes your favorite
author's history of whatever

Every text is a historical fact  Every text was written by some
person or some group of people for some purpose  Hence every
text can serve as historical evidence  The question is what can
we learn from a text  Of what interesting things if any does
the text provide evidence

The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi formerly of
Oregon are historical evidence  The gospels are historical
evidence  The letters of the officers who participated in the 
vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence  The
modern American history textbooks that whitewash great American
figures are historical evidence  These are all historical
evidence of various things  They are not much evidence at all
that the Maharishi formerly of Oregon could levitate that
Jesus was resurrected that vampires exist or that great
American figures are as squeaky clean as we learned in school
They are better evidence that some people saw the Maharishi
late of Oregon levitate that some of the early Christians
thought Jesus was resurrected that many people in Eastern Europe
saw vampires return from the grave and that we still have an
educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather
than teach history

How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of
historical evidence  text or otherwise  evinces  This is a
very complex question that has no easily summarized answer
There are many books on the subject or various parts of the
subject  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's Historian's Fallacies
as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy
to read texts present history  It's relatively cheap  It's easy
to read  Give it a try

Hello Ceci

     My name is Tony and I have a few comments on your rosicrucian
adventure I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in
any Order fraternity etc with or without the word Rosicrucian in the 
name of the organization I only claim having done some homework 

     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems
different it's my lack of writing skills showing nothing else Heck
English may be my second language And then again maybe not by now 

     I proceed

I had an ehum interesting experience with the Rosicrucians or at
least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday

     Let's start with the name Rosicrucian I took me a long time to come
to the conclusion that there is a difference between a member of a
rosicrucian body and BEING a ROSICRUCIAN So when you say that you met
some 'rosicrucians' you mean members of a group that calls themselves
rosicrucian At least that is what your observation suggests 

     I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium
Rosicrucianum only because they may be confused by some readers of this
newsgroup with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based the USA Jurisdiction in
San Jose CA this being the RC org with the most members last time I
looked Of course most members does not necessarily mean best

     Anyway the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they
descend at least in part from what was the GoldundRosenkreuz Golden
and Rosy Cross from the th century There were two Golden and Rosy
Cross the first chronologically more alchemical the second with
Masonic tinges but their history is the subject of a complete chapter 

     You'll have to trust me when I tell you that if that
lectureclasswhatever had been presented by AMORC it is unlikely that you
would have had the same impression ie you'd probably have had a
positive impression more likely than a negative one IMHO 

The first guy also said that the Rs are a mystical Christian order and
that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars
English from the thirteenth century

     Again instead of Rs it should be Lectorium Rosicrucianum  It
is curious to know that  other RC 'orders' in the USA claim to be non
sectarian

     The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged
the 'authority' of the medieval catholic church They flourished during the
th century century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the
crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the
worldly ways of its clerics It was largely in response to the church's
unseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root first in northern
Italy then throughout the south of France


What made me a bit suspicious was the way they first said that we all
contained something divine and could find our way back to divinity
then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently
but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss

     I don't see nothing fundamentally wrong with us containing
something divine And yes I don't like phrases like eternal bliss
either

Madison avenue in New York City is where the most influential read

In article Aprbatmanbmdtrwcom jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom writes
 The default condition in the absence of a preponderance of
evidence either way is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable
And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that heshe
simply disbelieves that the proposition is true is the only one who
holds no burden of proof  This is why the socalled weak atheist
position is virtually unassailable  not because it stands on a firm
foundation of logical argument but because it's proponents simply
disbelieve in the existence of Gods and therefore they hold no burden
of proof  When you don't assert anything you don't have to prove
anything  That's where weak atheism draws its strength  But its
strength is also its Achilles' heel  Without assertionsaxioms one
has no foundation upon which to build  As a philosophy it's virtually
worthless  IMO of course

Yes as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless  This is true in
exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in
Zeus is worthless  Atheists construct their personal philosophies
from many different sources building nongodbased ideas in the same
way as Christians build nonZeusbased ideas of thunderbolts
Atheists no more base their philosophy on atheism than Christians
base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus

The weak atheist position is logically extremely assailable  any
logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it
as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak
atheist  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with
attempts to provide such a logical demonstration and they all fail
miserably  In fact most of the people around here who claim the
strong as opposed to mathematical atheist position do so on this
basis not only do we not believe in a god but also all the arguments
presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound
therefore one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do
not exist  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are
defined to be logically undemonstrable but these are not the gods of
popular religion and the coherence of such claims is quite
questionable

    I found this on the net at my college It sounds pretty good to me What do
    you folks think

    This are the tenets of Stan as handed down and set within the Holy Book 
    of Stan
    
     Thou shalt not spill thine drinks or waste thine food for all that 
    is is sacred and to waste is the denizen of Luc the Infidel All who 
    waste today shall have not tomorrow
    
     Thou shalt pay heed to those who know the higher calling of Stan so
    that they may teach you the way and that thou shalt become one with
    Stan and the universe shall be in your hands
    
     Thou shalt honor thy loved ones and cherish those near you for they
    are the true path to happiness and happiness is a devine gift of thy
    lord Stan
    
     Stan is the one true God and shall be taken before all others so
    that the false gods will know that he is the one and all who oppose
    him shall forever be banished to the form of the sheep and be sent to
    the flocks of Luc for all eternity
    
     The word is the law and the law is the word The word is within
    thine own heart follow the path and be true to thine own self and thou
    shalt be blessed by Stan thy lord and saviour
        
     Thou shalt honor the faiths of others for it is their choice to
    follow this path and do not think less of others for being of a
    different faith yet even in the face of these false gods do not
    waiver in thine faith in Stan and hope that the unbeliever will see
    the light that is Stan
    
     Thou shalt not wrong others for being different for Stan cherishes
    the different and holds freedom in the highest regard for to do less
    would be to fall in with Luc the Infidel for Stan does not control
    he merely guides and lets the choice lie within thine own heart
    
     Thou shalt know that thy lord Stan has many names and is called
    differently by many people but know also that Stan is the true name
    and all those of the faith shall know that Stan is God and God is Stan
    
     Thou shalt be to the world what thou art to thineself for to be
    false to others is to be false to yourself Thy lord Stan asks not that
    you be like him he asks only that you be like yourself for that is all
    you were ever meant to be
    
     Thou shalt not kill the innocent nor spill blood unnecessarily for
    those who are deserving of death shall be dealt with by Stan and sent
    for all eternity to the flocks of Luc and those who harm the children 
    of Stan being born of Woman shall be judged as the sheep of

How does one falsify God's existance  This again is a belief not a scien
tific premise  The original thread referred specifically to scientific
creationism  This means whatever theory or theories you propose must be
able to be judged by the scientific method  This is in contrast to
purely philosophical arguments

	If given a definite definition of God it is sometimes possible to 
falsify the existance of that God 
	But when one refuses to give an immutable definition one can not

If you would like to understand better the sort of behavior
that we saw in connection with the Waco tragedy I'd strongly
recommend reading When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger
Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter available as a Harper
Torchbook It goes a long way towards explaining how a 
belief system can be so strong as to withstand even overwhelming
disconfirmatory evidence At least read the first chapter
Interestingly just as the Branch Davidians had roots in the
SeventhDay Adventist movement the SDAs themselves had their
roots in the Millerite movement of the first half of the th
centurya movement that expected the end of the world in 
was disappointed when it did not take place and wound up as
a church

The one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the
world over the centuries is the resurrection of Jesus  

This is hardly possible as the majority of people in the world were
born lived their life and died without ever knowing anything about
Christ  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he 
is not who Emery thinks he is



emery
Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that
Jesus really did rise from the dead
We have four gospel accounts  

I am leaving out all proofs of Emery's which rely on quoting the
bible as proof  Circular reasoning etc  There have been occasions
already stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change
edit or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel
And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it
is true then to be fair we have to do the same to the BhagavadGita
and the Koran both of which contradict the bible

Enough said
emery
Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest
We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that
these people were not Godfearing people who sincerely and wholeheartedly
believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event
And for what gain would they lie  To make a stand at that time meant 
persecution imprisonment and perhaps even death

Again this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof
of any of this happening  It just isn't there

Besides simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not
make your faith correct  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now
does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam is
the correct religion
emery
History bears out the persecution of Christians  Roman historian Cornelius 
Tacitus Govenor of Asia in AD  writing of Nero's reign alluded to 
the torture of Christians in Rome


All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith  That
does not prove that their faith is true or correct it just means that they
were sincere in their beliefs 

Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth
It's not that easy  And minority religions have always suffered torture
Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today  All religions
are harassed in China today  You haven't proven anything so far



emery
With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer it
would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy
would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax  

Not if they didn't believe that it was a hoax  


emery
Yet not one did  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make
up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen
from the dead especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those
who believed

The followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koran
says Muhammad performed  They were attacked and slaughtered for their
beliefs  They didn't denounce Muhammad or Islam  If you are correct
then that means Islam is the true faith
Frank DeCenso
 But how It's evident from the texts in Ezek  that God isn't concerned
 about buildings or structures  God is concerned about people  The people and
 leadership Ezek  never did return as a city  Others may have come later
 and built a city but the people and leadership that God prophesied about in
 Ezek  were never rebuilt as a city of people and leaders 


How incredibly fucking stupid  Of course the text is referring to the city
itself buildings bricks mortar etc  Otherwise it makes no sense to
refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a place to spread 
fishing nets

Frank DeCenso

I need to prioritize things in my life and this board is not all that important
to me  

Of course it is  It forms a very big part of your selfrespect  You come onto 
the board thinking you're some sort of apologeticist for your faith and you
routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded assumptions

Frank DeCenso
This board will have
to wait until if ever I can organize my life to fit it in  I tried dropping
out but Sieferman coerced me to come back  He won't this time

I doubt that Sieferman has anything to do with you dropping out  

It's probably closer to the truth to say that you don't have the cards to 
play in this game because you insist on playing from a losing hand and you're
finally realizing it  You will lurk on the board and keep 
quiet for a while looking for an area where you are certain that you 
are correct and then we'll see you pop back in again  Of course you then
will say that you have merely returned because your life is now in order

But we'll know better

John  Most assuredly I say to you unless a grain of wheat
falls onto the ground and dies it remains alone but if it dies it
produces much grain
  He who loves his life will lose it and he who hates his life in
this world will keep it for eternal life
  If anyone serves Me let him follow Me and where I am there My
servant will be also  If anyone serves Me him My Father will honor

Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one

Again you missed Jesus's point  If you read the surrounding passages
you would understand what Jesus means by life in the world  But
as is you bumbled around asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk
and came up with the wrong idea  Also you do not know exactly
what Jesus means by eternal life  

Brian K do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics
book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding
material  Why do you such with the Bible  For an idea what Jesus
means by the world look up references to it in your concordance  For
a good description the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game  For 
eternal life check out John  John   You will find that
eternal life is quite different than what you think  Eternal life
starts NOWan infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship
with God


In short even if your deity does exist that doesn't automatically
mean that I would worship it  I am content to live my own life and
fend for myself so when I die I can be proud of the fact that no
matter where I end up it will be because of my actions and my choices

If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this then so be
it  I would much rather just cease to exist  But if your god wants
my respect and my obedience then it had better earn these and if it
does then they will be very strong and true

If my diety exists you would not just cease to exist  Jesus talks of
hell in Luke   


You've got to understand my pointofview I see Christians spouting
Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that
will level all opposition  Truth is it's not  Robert has never
demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply he
just rattles them off day by day  Some brazenly fly in the face of
common sense and reality and I point these out where I can


The truth is is that it is not some sort of magic spell  The truth
is is that you do not understand it and enjoy not understanding it

Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book 


Wrong again  Christianity is supposed to be relationship  You
do not even know what Christianity is and you are arguing against
it

And in my opinion you're bumbling about blindly making up entities
where there aren't any and depriving yourself of a true understanding
and enjoyment of your life  As long as you keep your beliefs to
yourself I'll keep my beliefs to myself  but as soon as you start
waving them around expect me to toss in my opinions too

Then there is the rumour that Loresh in fact survived the fire in a secret

I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either  They are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  Gravity too is
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we call gravity  Gravity however is not 
a fact  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment  Newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force Einstein a wave Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it  That takes a great 
leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  Evolution
is no different

Are you serious  Here's an exercise next time you are in the barnyard 
Take your model and hold it directly above a fresh cowpie  Then release the

 And I felt torn when I began to disagree with a lot of what the Bible
 and my priests told me 

Did it start getting a little uncomfortable  Did your style start feeling a
bit cramped

Yes that's exactly what I felt  My heart just felt that what I was
being taught was wrong  a basically good message but framed in
errors  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were
somehow not equal to men that homosexuals are guilty of their
lifestyle that pride in one's work is a bad thing that Jesus died
for me  I don't want ANYBODY to die for me especially as an
impersonal act where the person can't possibly even know me well
enough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not

I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good
thing  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message
of Christianity then so be it  Maybe I'm just not compatible with
Christianity  I just refuse to follow rules blindly and since I
can't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you
describe it I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters

I know how that goes  Knowing I couldn't and didn't want to 
live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me
outside too  

Don't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I
don't believe in your god  I will not steal and I will not murder 
not because I fear divine repudiation but because these just aren't
in my character  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just
running around on a murdering spree stealing things when I'm able
insulting people for the heck of it because I'm not answerable to
anyone but you'd be wrong  I'm answerable to myself  A life like
that would be a cheap life I happen to want to earn respect in myself

'Till I met the Man that is

My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soulsearching
and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of
God with me  I finally decided that I had once felt this presence
just as I had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a
little tyke protecting me from the monsters under the bed  that I
had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear as
something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers

Since then I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your
supernatural trinity does exist  But there are a few times when in
my darkened room by my bed I have set aside everything I believe for
a moment and called out to whatever's out there because I want to
know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know  And I
have not yet received an answer

 Only when I truly listened to myself body and soul did I realize
 that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being
 Christian  There is a higher truth in the universe and Christianity
 just ain't it

Any suggestions on what or who or where it might be and why

Nope  It may well be unknowable  Scientists have suggested that the
universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the threedimensional
universe may be mapped onto a fourdimensional supersphere in the same
way you can map a twodimensional plane onto a threedimensional
sphere see Sphereland the sequel to Flatland for more thoughts
on this  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four
dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck
in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variables
become too much for us to even speculate on

That is there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to
be so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor
had anything to do with it

OK you may say So now if I'm just being good am I doing good enough

That's for you to answer  If you feel you're doing fine then go ahead and
ignore us foolish little Christians  We can present what we've seen and
experienced providing our witness but it isn't up to us to make that seed
sprout  

Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy
book and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe guilt
trips insinuations that I'm without morals arguments from disbelief
how can you possibly believe that God doesn't exist and so
forth  All I'm asking is for you to convince me  I want to be convinced
but it's not going to be easy

So much as you don't like what we're selling there just may be someone
out there that can identify with it  Methinks you could give us all a 
lesson in tolerance and back off

Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both
the inside and the outside I view it as harmful in many ways  It
preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives and once it's
got these people it teaches them to have pity and sometimes starkly
intolerant of others who do not share these views  Maybe you'll say
that your religion doesn't teach that  but I've got to judge
Christianity from the Christians I know

I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's
self and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason
than that

So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some
people think  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly
valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity
whatsoever and I want people who are considering Christianity to
realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy
fulfilled life

I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice
things  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses
is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong and
they know the weaknesses of their religion yet they still decide to
believe but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think
any less of people who don't agree with them

Obviously the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the
Christian's faith is far from conclusive notwithstanding how vehemently we
propose otherwise

Precisely my point  You've still not given me a reason to be a
Christian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem

 The nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deeply enough in
 it is that eventually you'll be able to feel justified in most
 anything you want to do

Y'know your right  Fortunately for everyone around me I'm not religious  
I'm a Christian

 just as the Moslems aren't religious and the Buddhists aren't
religious  Who is religious then
Reading Stephen Jay Gould's essay Evolution as Fact and Theory wouldn't
hurt either  It appears in Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes

 Recently I've asked myself a rather interesting question What RIGHT does
 god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of course 
 

He is God

 In his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
 according to his rules we will burn in hell Well with what RIGHT can god
 make that desicion 

He is God

 Let's say for the sake of argument that god creates every
 one of us directly or indirectly it doesn't matter What then happens is
 that he first creates us and then turns us lose Well I didn't ask to be
 created 


God granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint
 
 Let's make an analogue If a scientist creates a unique living creature which
 has happened it was even patented does he then have the right to
 expect it to behave in a certain matter or die


The scientist creates the living creature to examine it poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour  He will kill it if it becomes a threat  For
example let's say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks
free of its confines and starts devouring the population  The scientist
would not hesitate in killing it

God creates us to be His loving companions  He knows whether we are true in 
our love for Him or not  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him
God cannot abide by sin  By rejecting God a person becomes an enemy of God
one that must be killed by Him  Note  I say that God and God alone is
worthy to be Judge Jury and Executioner  We are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy
 
 Who is god to impose its rules on us  Who can tell if god is REALLY so
 righteous as god likes us to believe Are all christians a flock of sheep
 unable to do otherwise that follow the rest 


God is God  Who are we to question the Creator  If you doubt God's doing
in certain situations do you claim to know a better solution  Would you
be playing the role of God

 These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had
 expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
 direct witness to God's existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
 is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
 Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
 God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
 age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
 repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
 for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
 alike
 
 Sorry if this is late for the thread but
 
 I thought God was supposed to be constant and neverchanging  How do
 you reconcile this common Christian view with the paragraph above


God never changes  He still loves us  Sending Jesus was one of His
attempts to reconcile with mankind  The nature of God has not changed

 
 Also while we're at it
 
  How do you reconcile A KIND and LOVING God with the
 JudeoChristian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable
 by death  Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing
 KINDness and LOVE


Sinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate death  There are
several OT passages to back this up  God is God  He cannot tolerate
the prescence of sin in His midst  And the Israelites knew this  And
still some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed  Were these
people KIND and LOVing themselves  God gave them every break He could
but in the end He really had no choice in the matter  Seeing as how
we were failing to achieve salvation on our own He sent His Son to die
for us  to be the ultimate sin offering  Now we live in the age of
grace


 
  Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of
 having made a mistake


He sent His Son as a consolation to us out of love
 
  Now that we are living in the age of grace does this mean that
 for our sins God now damns us to eternal hell after we die rather
 than killing us immediately  If so is this eternal damnation an
 example of A KIND and LOVING God


Hey let's be fair for a moment here  KIND and LOVING does not mean
a free ride  There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship
Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that 
children can do whatever they want  NOT  Part of being a parent means
administering punishment when the child is at fault  Part of being a 
parent means giving instruction  God tests us through the trial of
life such that we may grow stronger  He teaches what is right and 
what is wrong  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us
be it Heaven or be it Hell  If God did not follow through with what
He has warned us about He would not be a very good parent

In parenting if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through
with it the children will not take that parent's words very seriously
God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and
what not to do  By life's trials we see the folly of doing our own
will rather than His  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting
Him when it comes time for Judgement  Do we follow Him

I will

Peace be with you

Jesus did and so do I

Didn't expect to find you in the Devil's role Stephen but these are
the times that try men's souls
 
 	o  What was called many months of planning was probably
 	   the intelligence collecting paperwork and interviews
 
Nine months as I understand it  No doubt this accounts for a 
significant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending
our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such
an event  But my gut instinct says there is more at hand  It took
some careful preplanning to demonize DK to such an extent  The
attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation
that seems to be the agenda of the day  It also fits a pattern of
increased government interference in personal religious beliefs
Randy Weaver is now on trial

 	o  It's important to them because it justifies budgets

No quarrel here  The BIG BANG theory is always apt at appropriation
time  They just don't have to possess a single motive
 
 	o  The warrant was sealed to keep from jeopardizing the 
 	   the government's case

I certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government's
case since it makes no claims of illegal action  Therefore the federal
judge had reason to seal it  But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's
remark that secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government
There is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of
free people
 
 	o  There was probably no one actually exercising oversite
 	   Instead a system of bureaucratic rules has been set 
 	   up for such incidents Like computer programs  these
 	   have to be debugged periodically Especially when used
 	   in fringe areas cf the hostage rescue program
 	   Therefore  NO ONE WAS IN CHARGE And no one can 
 	   reasonably be held responsible 

How can I argue with irrefutable logic  I have long suspected that
the government has become a mindless machine and now you go and
confirm my worst fears  Has it become a BEAST that is programmed
simply to say Kiss my toe and you get your piece of the pie
I suspect bugs in the program arise when agents or those who love
this critter have independent thoughts
 
 	o  What they were after generally speaking is protecting
 	   their jobs budgets and paychecks

And watching Terminator II
 
 
 We waited  days for our hostages to come home from Iran  We gave these
 people  days  
 
     died at the Alamo   died that day in Waco    

Yes  seeds for a new Republic  And  for
 					
    Rev  And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and
              nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an
              half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put
              in graves               
 
    Why no burial  Is is that the bodies of the Witnesses will be said
    to be property of the state  Or just a typical bureaucratic delay
 
    Rev And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice
		over them and make merry and shall send gifts one
		to another because these two prophets tormented them
		that dwelt on the earth

Stephen have you sensed that some have been rejoicing lately

A moment of silence doesn't mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise it's not silent now is it

Nonreligious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead
classmate  to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased   to give the classmates a moment to grieve together 
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the
context of the school  to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that it's not disruptive later

Yeah all well and good The fact is though that the proschool
prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way
to get prayer back At my high school for instance our dear
principal ended the moment of silence with Amen

I can certainly see opposing the Amen  but that doesn't require 
opposing a moment of silence

I'll back off when they do

Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here  I guarantee
you the people who want school prayer aren't going to back off when
they can't even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray
silently

I don't necessarily agree with Pat Robertson  Every one will be placed before
the judgement seat eventually and judged on what we have done or failed to do

I'm sorry but He does not  Ever read the FIRST commandment

tell kids that they ought to pray now with kids aren't allowed

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively

You're just overloading the word value AGAIN I suspect

Maybe you're underloading it   If from hundreds of alleged procedures for
obtaining truth about the material world I pick science then that is a 
subjective judgement according to the strict meaning of the terms yes

Yes naturally

Ordinarily it is also a value judgement though it needn't be one 
could do science without believing it was worth a damn in any context 
though that hardly seems sensible

No you're just overloading the word value again It is an
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth
Shit I don't even know what worth means Consider the possibility
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value
science at all 

But you STILL value likely ways over unlikely ways correct If I wanted to
know the truth about say the specific gravity of chicken soup I could 
employ science  meters gauges scales etc  or I could just talk a walk 
on a beach somewhere Both have a possibility of generating the truthful 
answer  in the case of the walk on the beach it would have to be some sort 
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just 
happened to be truthful  so what makes me choose the scientific method of 
truthdetermination over the walk on the beach method Because I VALUE 
science's higher probability of obtaining truth that's why Everywhere one 
turns there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the 
veneer of detached objectivity It is an inescapable aspect of the human 
condition

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not

OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in 
any important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   
DES does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either

This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which
accepts  bytes and uses the first  to ECB the second 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics

The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in 
the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent  Such a box 
may as well be assumed to wear a dufflecoat and go to the Limerick Races

Truth by blatant assertion again Frank It's observationally the
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations

Well I would add that the attribute works even when not being measured is 
ALSO something which is valued and intended Eric All you've succeeded in 
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values

  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else
Twaddle You're overloading the meaning of the word value
that's all Whether I care if the results are true is a value
I fail to see how whether they are true correct whatever is
a value

The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it if you
care to look at it that way  however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth unless you care to follow the a
procedure to obtain truth science correctly  You have to pick 
the right procedure and note its importance  You've got to value it
Otherwise you don't care about actual truth and shouldn't object
to the statement objectivism is true

Nonsequitur Humans do math because they value what math can do
That does not mean that math is based on values  unless you claim
that computers or even unconstructed physical systems which instantiate
mathematical systems also are based on values 

The point is that when we recognize these instantiations of mathematical
systems we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even 
to control these instantiations There is always a driving purpose behind
thought  a motive if you will Sometimes that motive is relatively 
pure eg pursuit of knowledge othertimes it's impure eg pursuit
of money or of physical pleasure But it's always there And even when it
is a pure pursuit of knowledge presumably one pursues knowledge in order
to personally grow develop advance to a higher plane of being So there
is still an element of acquisition of reaching of grasping even in the
approach of the detached objective scientist 

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively then we are using a maybenotquitesure
method on maybenotquitesure observations  That should lead
to maybenotquitesure results no  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable

OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in any 
important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   DES
does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either

The DES chip works just fine even if I don't know that it exists
You are confusing why we are using the chip with the chip works
They aren't the same

No I think you are the one who is rather confused There are two senses
in which we can say that the phenomenon of the working of the DES chip is 
valuebased

	 Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES
	   chip and started it running in the first place

		and

	 Because the very notiondefinitionconcept of works has value
	   associated with it

The first is a CAUSAL linkage  we want it to work therefore we CAUSE it to 
work That is rather a mundane interpretation The second however is a more 
subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage  that the attribute works is 
itself as everything else presented to the human consciousness as a valued 
fact not just a factinitself You are perhaps justified in shooting down 
the causal linkage but you have not begun to address the phenomenological 
linkage

Suns in unpopulated solar systems shine without being blessed by your
values 

Our predictions or confirmations that suns shine in unpopulated solar systems
are however items of value

Genetic algorithms closely related to the scientific method
can work without intervention of any kind 

Again our predictions or confirmations of the working of genetic algorithms
are items of value

Your claim is without merit
the universe does not depend on human values any more than it
revolves around earth

The universe does not DEPEND on human values no but our experience and
understanding and concepts of the universe are laced with human values
Phenomenologically everything is valuerelated since the thing which is 
experiencing the phenomena ie self is itself valuedriven Self is in 
fact the very SOURCE of all values Whatever involves self involves values

 
This was obviously a lot different than the ordinary FBI adventure

I believe that the Federal officers had a conflict of interests here

Throught out the whole affair it seamed to me that they were chiefly
concerned with saving face rather than saving lifes  Its true that
The BD were resisting arrest and that they should have surrendered
when they first realized that these where federal officers  But they
didnt
 
I'm not sure what you mean by 'saving face' unless you are confusing
the FBI with the BATF who are the ones who were in charge of the
original search warrant
 
But when they didnt the FBI should not have treated as a hostage
situation it wasn't

I think  more discussions possible independant negotiators and
family intervention should have been used

Independant Negotiators What was there to negotiate Any sort of plea
bargin has to be brought to the court the negotiators can't negotiate
charges or sentences FBI negotitators did make a deal for the
Dividians to come out Koresh showed he was not negotiating in good
faith and there is no reason to believe independent negotiators
would have done any better

I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead  The FBI and
the BATF could not let a man like that live  He was a testimonial to their
stupidity and lies    

Now before everyone gets crazy with me let me say that Koresh was crazy as 
a bed bug but out government was crazierand they lied to us

They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time  Yet 
whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into
town on a regular basis  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and 
wondered why they didn't pick him up then  There are two possible answers
First they didn't see him  What kind of survaillance is that  Second they
didn't care  They wanted a confrontation  They wanted publicity and they got
it

After the first battle they told us that they did not know he knew they were
coming  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that
Well we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway

Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige  According to
them they did but according to the Hartford Courant the woman that raised
Koresh His Grandmother was not allowed to go in and see him                 
 The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he
said

A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out
His grandmother raised Vernon Howell Koresh's Real name  she didn't raise
David Koresh

Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a
logical level  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you

Here's another one  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that
they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must
be done  Now they claim they never thought he would do it

I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how
much money this was costing  That was the start of the Justification part
part of the plan  That's when I knew it would come soon

But back to the plan  It is considered Cruel and Unusal Punishment to
execute criminals in the minds of many people but look at what's acceptable

They knew the parents adults had gas masks  They did not know or were not
sure if the children had them  So the plan was to pour the gas into the 
compound  The mothers seeing what the gas was doing to their children were
supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with

I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR
Chemical Biological Radiological warfare training  Part of that training
is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were
subjected to  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical 
agent that irritates the skin  You think its on fire

I have no doubts the children would become hysterical  Its not the kind of
thing you never want to do again  This was the plan the final solution

We waited  days for our hostages to come home from Iran  We gave these
people  days  

I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole
thing that the government could point to as a success  Well FBI agent Ricks
changed my mind  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant

And while expressing regret at the loss of life he suggested that the
operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal
shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt

It took  dead children to get us that new definition of success

One more thought  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic
weapons on the premises 
                                                      
        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE  CALIBER MACHINE GUN

THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY

Still without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him
For all of this my President takes full responsibility  What a guy
I hope he gets it

Before you go absolving the BATF  FBI of all blame in this incident you should
probably be aware of two important facts
  There is no such thing as nontoxic tear gas  Tear gas is nonbreathable
    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting followed eventually
    by siezures and death  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people
    they exposed  Any potential heart problems among the BD's
 
 No doubt it is dangerous stuff when concentrated
 
  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister  Tear gas is produced by burning a
    chemical in the can  The fumes produced are tear gas  The canister has a 
    warning printed on the side of it  Contact with flamable material can result
    in fire  Now how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building 
    they admited was a firetrap
 
 None  They used nonincindiary methods which means they produced the gas 
 outside the building and pumped it in via the tanks

 horror story about FBI ruining a guy's life for the hell of it omitted

It was the BATF but what are a few fundamental facts between friends

 So is this a real story or a work of fiction  How about some
 sources  When where and in what newspaper did you get all this
 from  Or is it all hypothetical

You don't pay me enough to create long works of fiction for your reading
amusement

The text excerpted appeared in the NRA Official Journal of March 
The full text of the article is available for anonymous FTP from 
godivanectarcscmuedu I believe the file name is lawmaster

It's a cheap shot for cynics to blow off the source just because it's a 
biased NRA publication  If your local news media didn't choose to 
report on this incident that's their failure not ours  

So be intellectually honest and check out the story independently  
Enough names dates and locations are provided his neighbors also 
witnessed the BATF's behavior

One warning  you may or may not get anywhere attempting to research 
this through government sources

    When Lawmaster's attorney went to the US Courthouse to obtain a
  copy of the affidavit supporting the search warrant so that he could
  determine whether there was probable cause for the issuance of the
  warrant he was told by court officials that the US Attorney had
  asked that the affidavit be sealed

Sealed warrants hm where have we heard about THOSE lately

  So do you want the president to specifically order each and every activity
of the FBI or what  And how willing are you to blame Reagan and Bush
directly for the incidents that took place in the War on Drugs in their
administration  Are you going to blame Bush for the fact that Weaver's wife

 or consider the thousands in Central America killed by those brave

 Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has
further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon
of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

Don't think so  It would become a singularity in a few miliseconds

fact if we are to believe evidence gathered during the last two
centuries from geology paleontology molecular biology and many other
scientific disciplines  Despite the many believers in Divine creation
who dispute this  the probability that evolution has occurred
approaches certainty in scientific terms  Hitching The Neck of
the Giraffe

Of course  Hitchings believes in evolution  The purpose of the quote I
sited was to show the ambivalance that evolutionists have with their own
theory  For example on page  he states one may question an 
evolution theory so beset by doubts among even those who teach it  If
Darwinism is truely the great unifying principle of biology it encompasses
extraordinarily large areas of ignorance  It fails to explain some of the
basic questions of all  how lifeless chemicals came alive what rules of
grammer lie behind the genetic code how genes shap and form living things

Ordinarily it is also a value judgement though it needn't be one 
could do science without believing it was worth a damn in any context 
though that hardly seems sensible
No you're just overloading the word value again It is an
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth
Shit I don't even know what worth means Consider the possibility
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value
science at all 
But once you make a decision on the value of truth and the likelihood of 
science getting it the rest follows
SO
What's your point

In your example science is necessarily
worthless
MAYBE TO ME In this example and as I argue below that's not even
true

and so are its results
Not necessarily

because truth is worthless assuming that's
all science is good for
But science is also good for technology which may or may not
have anything to do with truth I may value technology and
not truth after all

And it's no accident that phrases such as good
for fit so naturally in this context
Spare me This is nonsense Frank Pregnancy is sometimes referred
to as having a bun in the oven Does this mean that the uterus
is at  F Argument by idiom is weak indeed and it's what
you're engaging in here

Just because evaluating an arithmetic expression
and asking how much you value life both involve the word value doesn't
mean that they refer to the same thing at all I understand that
the word value is used for both but you have to be clear in what
sense you are using the words I agree with judging science as a
value in the first sense but not the second
But I don't use it in the second sense  Consider that Fma is no 
different than F until I note the connection with reality that Fma has and
F does not
Of course it's different ma What is at issue is accuracy
not difference

I'm making a decision as to the importance of Fma
over other expressions I can compute
This is the result of a chain of deduction about the value
of understanding the universe One can make the observation
that IF one wanted to understand the universe Fma would be
valuable without believing Fma to be valuable Frank

I'm valuing it whether implicitly or
directly because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality
are different to other things which do not
Things which have a basis in reality are different from things
which have a basis in reality Quantum mechanics is very different
from biochemistry yet they both allegedly have basises in reality
Look Frank noone said that people didn't do science because they
value itin the sense of think it is good but that is not necessary
to make the observation that it's results have value in the sense
that they are accurate Allow me to give you an example I think
that knowing the byte order on IBM s is pretty much worthless
I don't care to know it but I would be quite prepared to
note as valuable ie accurate the claim that it was Bigendian
if it was shown to be so like by showing me the manual

 And noone points
out an unimportant difference except to say that it's unimportant
Important useful worthy etc are all words with evaluative
power quite different from evaluating an expression  I'm careful
to use value in the sense I mean which is invariably the first
No it's fleeking not Scientific judgement is SOLELY the sense
of evaluating an expression accuracy It has nothing to do with
importance worthiness or usefulness Choice of problems DOES
have to do with those factors but they are orthogonal to
evaluating for accuracy solutions to chosen problems

The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in 
the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent  Such a box 
may as well be assumed to wear a dufflecoat and go to the Limerick Races
Truth by blatant assertion again Frank It's observationally the
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations
Yes it does  You're saying in effect it works independently of what I
believe and basing that statement on your reasonable assumption ie 
unsupported belief that it works indepently of what you believe
No I was saying that it works independently of whether I measure
it which is something quite different

 It
begs the question rather obviously
It would if they were the same thing which they are not

  And of course reasonable
assumption seems to be weasel words for seems useful useful
belonging to world of ghosts and values and therefore being unreal  
Frank you are attempting to inject goodness judgements where there
are only accuracy judgements by essentially punning on the word
'value' which has both meanings useful is a goodness judgement
Reasonable is an accuracy judgement They are not the same
thing at all Useful in making some conclusion is an accuracy
judgement again I'm afraid Sorry Frank but all you're doing is
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue IF you
mean to say that science is based on value accuracy judgements
I have no problem with that If you mean to say that it's based
on value goodness judgements that's nonsense By contrast
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements

No a noknock warrant is in clear violation of the th amendment
Okay what about the fact that they were tipped off  they shouldn't
have opened fire  right  WRONG  Think about this I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a noknock warrant So
being moronic sheep we wait with our guns holstered Now instead of
the Feds in comes my competition and we're history  The only
acceptable answer to a noknock warrant is blazing guns  I may sound
paranoid but our government is out of control and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it

Hmm  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn clearly marked as
officers and yelling Police repeatedly  This is used every day to bust drug
houses  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and
display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight  As for not knocking it's
a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even
fight  Usually this strategy works if it didn't then it wouldn't be used so
commonly now would it

Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my
point since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear
judgement on this issue

I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day
Furthermore we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending
potentially dangerous and armed suspects  Do you suggest that the police
always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have
been allowed to inspect the officers's badges  Just what should the police do
when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects  How far can they
reasonably go to identiy themselves  What do you suggest they can do which
can't be faked by the competition

Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops that's not an
excuse to murder police  In the case of the BD's there was almost definitely
at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops

 For an illustrative example in the opposite direction it may be possible
 to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium  If you
 add preventative services and this reduces acute care use then the total
 premium may fall

Women who are known not to want abortion services for example
might be judged to be more likely to require prenatal care

Malcolm Lee mleepostRoyalRoadsca wrote
 I will clarify my earlier quote  God's laws were originally written for 
 the Israelites  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
 all people not just the Jews  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
 Heaven through the saving grace of God  I never said that the Law was made
 obsolete by Jesus

Just for reference here's the earlier quote
Malcolm Lee mleepostRoyalRoadsca wrote in reference to Leviticus 
and Deuteronomy 
 These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had
 expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
 direct witness to God's existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
 is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately
 punishable
 Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to
 God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in
 the age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There
 is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And
 not just for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew
 and Gentile alike

These are two conflicting statements  To say one is a clarification of the
other is a breach of logic  I don't mind people shifting their position on
an issue  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change
was made  What about Deuteronomy   Is it wrong now  Did Jesus
change that

 If anything He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made  In the
 following verses Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
 the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended

Sure he does this  However he doesn't address the notion of stoning
nonvirgin brides because this needs no clarification  Are you going to
deny that Deuteronomy  is not patently clear in its intent

 I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world a lot of
 modernday Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
 in it  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart

I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible
from end to end and don't believe in it  Depending on how they use this
knowledge they can be scary  They can argue any position they desire and
back it up with selected parts of the Bible  Such Pharisees include David
Koresh and Adolph Hitler  I will qualify this by saying I don't know if
they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly
made the means look frightening

However just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible but
believe every word  In fact this is probably scarier since there are far
more of these people from what I've seen  In addition they are very easy
to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees since they don't know enough
to debate with these people

 Christianity is not just a set of rules it's a lifestyle that changes one's
 perspectives and personal conduct  And it demands obedience to God's will

No it demands obedience to a book  If God came down and personally told
me how I should behave then I would say that I would be doing God's will
by doing it  However if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to
obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to
two millenia even longer for the OT even if I follow everything in it
with my heart I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing
the will of God

 Some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  That is
 their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too

Well if God respects it so much how come there is talk in the Bible about
eternal damnation for nonbelievers  I see little respect eminating from
the god of the Bible  I see a selfish and spiteful god

 God be with you

Not yours thanks

And for the curious here is my earlier post
 Hmm for a book that only applied to the Israelites Deuteronomy Jesus sure
 quoted it a lot Mt    In addition he alludes to it in several
 other places Mt  Mk  Jn   And just in case it isn't
 clear Jesus thought the Old Testament isn't obsolete I'll repeat the
 verse in Matthew which gets quoted on this group a lot
 
 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets I have
 not come to abolish them but to fulfill them  I tell you the truth until
 heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke
 of a pen will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is
 accomplished  Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments
 and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of
 heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called
 great in the kingdom of heaven  For I tell you that unless your
 righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
 you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven  Mt  NIV in
 pretty red letters so that you know it's Jesus talking
 
 This causes a serious dilemma for Christians who think the Old Testament
 doesn't apply to them  I think that's why Paul Harvey likes quoting it so
 much

I would like to add my support for a misctaoism discussion group
I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting cupportalcom 
Thyagicupportalcom I read in altmagick but I differ
with himher in believing that at least some minimal parameters 
should be agreed upon

Thyagi wrote

 I recommend that the depth of generality indeed of AMBIGUITY in this
 newsgroup misctaoism be maximized  Calling the Tradition old or new
 is rather unnecessary and only leads to foolish squabbles  There is no
 doubt that Nature is a splendid teacher whether she appears in the words
 spoken by a tree or by a stream a microbe or a star  Let us not limit
 'misctaoism' to 'philosophy'  

But if we don't limit it to something the discussion degenerates into
a big amorphous glob 

Other questions Thyagi proposes are

  What is this 'actual process of reality'
  Why is Taoism based upon an assumption
  Why does this assumption concern knowledge and what can be known
  What is the value of not knowing
  What is 'a Tao'  What does it mean to be 'Tao'd'

It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the
category of general metaphysics I would prefer any misctaoism
to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated
with at least semiorthodox Taoism with established classic works 
definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about 

I think neoTaoism should be excluded or get its own group what I
mean by this is HumptyDumpty Taoism in which Taoism means whatever 
a poster says it means This alttaoism could also be a refuge 
for debates about what Taoism REALLY means or speculations on sexual
alchemy etc

eg from Thyagi again
 Taoism does what the hell it wants I tell you
 Taoism doesn't exist  'Taoism' is no more real that 'Tao'  Decide now
 Real or not real  Exist or notexist  When shall we be certain

Kent gloomily predicts quoting from Thyagi's article

 However most traffic in 
 the group will likely concern the philosophical secular taoism
 averred by Alan Watts and Niels Bohr and yogic taoism as it pertains
 to medical sexual and martial techniques

I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of
place What's happening is that that the term Taoism is becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic Alchemy 
Zen etc by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they 
want This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled The
Tao of this that and everything else With respect to some exceptions
like the books by Jou TsungHwa

Any other commentsideas I look forward to seeing them On balance
I say let misctaoism rip and let the chips fall where they may If
it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the
Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to
these groups just as they do now

If I wanted to
know the truth about say the specific gravity of chicken soup I could 
employ science  meters gauges scales etc  or I could just talk a walk 
on a beach somewhere Both have a possibility of generating the truthful 
answer  in the case of the walk on the beach it would have to be some sort 
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just 
happened to be truthful  so what makes me choose the scientific method of 
truthdetermination over the walk on the beach method Because I VALUE 
science's higher probability of obtaining truth that's why Everywhere one 
turns there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the 
veneer of detached objectivity It is an inescapable aspect of the human 
condition
This strikes me as rather obvious What is your point about this

ALSO something which is valued and intended Eric All you've succeeded in 
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values
Huh Of course I intend that it works But the fact that I want it
to work and want to use a procedure that will show that it works
has no bearing on the logical standing of the procedure that
I choose empiricism

I don't see how this is any kind of problem Kevin

A moment of silence doesn't mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise it's not silent now is it

Nonreligious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead
classmate  to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased   to give the classmates a moment to grieve together 
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the
context of the school  to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that it's not disruptive later

Yeah all well and good The fact is though that the proschool
prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way
to get prayer back At my high school for instance our dear
principal ended the moment of silence with Amen
I can certainly see opposing the Amen  but that doesn't require 
opposing a moment of silence
I see it as the camel's nose

I'll back off when they do
Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here  I guarantee
you the people who want school prayer aren't going to back off when
they can't even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray
silently
I'm willing to take my chances on winning the whole thing personally

 Recently I've asked myself a rather interesting question What RIGHT does
 god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of course 


He is God

In other words the right of might

 In his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
 according to his rules we will burn in hell Well with what RIGHT can god
 make that desicion 

He is God

In other words the right of might

 Let's say for the sake of argument that god creates every
 one of us directly or indirectly it doesn't matter What then happens is
 that he first creates us and then turns us lose Well I didn't ask to be
 created 


God granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint

In other words he can do it he did it and your in no position to
argue about it
 
 Let's make an analogue If a scientist creates a unique living creature which
 has happened it was even patented does he then have the right to
 expect it to behave in a certain matter or die


The scientist creates the living creature to examine it poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour  He will kill it if it becomes a threat  For
example let's say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks
free of its confines and starts devouring the population  The scientist
would not hesitate in killing it

God creates us to be His loving companions  He knows whether we are true in 
our love for Him or not  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him
God cannot abide by sin  By rejecting God a person becomes an enemy of God
one that must be killed by Him  Note  I say that God and God alone is
worthy to be Judge Jury and Executioner  We are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy
 
In other words you better do what this God wants you to do or else

 Who is god to impose its rules on us  Who can tell if god is REALLY so
 righteous as god likes us to believe Are all christians a flock of sheep
 unable to do otherwise that follow the rest 


God is God  Who are we to question the Creator  If you doubt God's doing
in certain situations do you claim to know a better solution  Would you
be playing the role of God

In other words its his game he made the rules and if you know whats
good for you you'll play his game his way

It sounds like you're modifying your definition of Christian to anyone
who strives to follow the teachings of Christ Do I read you
correctly And just what constitutes strive Did Jesus say this and
define just what striving means Can you give an example of striving 
that is insufficient to qualify one as a Christian and thus condemns one

So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
on their house killing most of the people inside

I'm not that annoyed about the adults they knew supposedly what
they were doing and it's their own actions

What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside
including mothers let the children suffer and die during awful
conditions

If this is considered religious following to the end I'm proud
that I don't follow such fanatical and noncompassionate religions

You might want to die for whatever purpose but please spare
the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all

I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity
knows about the word compassion Christians do you think 
the actions today would produce a good picture of your 
religion

  Robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying things
like it is held that cf Kermit thread  On what exact body of
theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox  Who is that holds
that Luke meant what you said he meant  Whenever your personal interpretation
of Biblical passages is challenged your only response seems
to be that one needs merely to look at the Bible in order to see the truth
but what of those who see Biblical things differently from you  Are we to
simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it
  Just curious

Rick Anderson  librbaBYUVMBITNET


When Robert refers to the orthodox he is talking about the Historical
position of the Christian Faith Such things are derived from Biblcal
texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith

You are right that people read things differently in the Bible and this
is alright in parts like parables and such forth However when it comes
to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs
there is only one correct way to read it For example either the
doctrine of the Trinity is true or it is false Yes people read the
texts differently but only one position is true They both cannot be
According to the text the doctrine is true and has always existed

Therefore when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and
thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the
Bible people consider him a cult

Why should anyone check let's restrict this to Christians why do we
want to find commandments in the books regarded as scripture  What's
going on I will pass on psychologizing answers whether dismissive or more
open as not the kind of issue to deal with here  the question is what is
the theological point involved  And it has been quoted at me often
enough by those who don't believe I take it seriously that Jesus is said
to have said If you love me you will obey my commands  John 

I am like any Christian the slave of Christ and it is my will that I
should do as He wills me to do  I am also or instead His younger brother
but still under His direction though we both call God Abba  Christians
therefore will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them and
discovering it will feel obligated to do it or to confess their failure
Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon such as slaves of
Christ  the point is that adherents of a religion will read the texts
whether classified as inspired or not that are held up as models in an
effort to find application to their own situations  This practice ranges
from devotional reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon
ical scripture as the Word of God  And at the highest pitch this leads
to a question of whether we can find in inspired scripture something that
can act as absolute guidance for our actions

The problem is in finding out just what it is our Lord commands  I am
going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians
have looked for these commands namely Christian tradition  That is not
because I reject tradition but because my primary audience in this essay
is Protestants who deny tradition a determinative value in favor of the
witness of Scripture  The question I want to deal with is WHAT commandments
can we find from our Lord in Scripture  And that turns out to be a hard
question   If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would like to turn the
discussion to the authority of tradition I can accomodate them  unlike
most Protestants Episcopalians admit claims from a Scripture b Reason
and c Tradition on roughly equal standing 

Earlier in John than my quote above we read John  I give you a new 
commandment love one another  This is the ONLY place in the NT where
Christians are given an explicit commandment with the context commenting
on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus  At the same meal so we
readers infer since it is not in John but in the Synoptics Jesus
says Take this bread this is my body  Mark  cf Matthew 
Luke   Corinthians   The mode is imperative Greek labete
and hence this too is a commandment

In both cases we have to infer that the command is directed to a wider
circle than the immediate collocation of disciples  because we judge the
evangelist's point in mentioning it with the disciples by then mostly or
entirely dead is that we are expected to follow this as a commandment
from our Lord  In the case of communion Paul's mention at least this
is probably true of the evangelists also implies an ongoing ritual liturgy
in which these words operate to bind Christians to the original command
to his disciples as a continuing commandment to the Christian community

I am entirely comfortable with this inference but I must point out that
it is THERE between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command
I take it as a clear inference at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion
that all Christians are called to love one another in Jesus' command
directed at the disciples  But I have to call attention to the inference
The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific
context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of Christ

All reading of scripture has to make such inferences to get any sense out
of the text whatsoever  This is a general problem in reading these texts
 we cannot read them at all without our own understanding of our native
languages in which we normally read the translated texts and without
some appreciation of the original context and at points the original
languages when English misleads us I am going to presume in what follows
that we have the general problem of how to read scripture under control
 I don't really think this is true but it will suffice for my current
purposes   I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already
coped with the understanding of a  year old text from another world
than the one we live in  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser
vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we
can read the texts as the original audience might have done

Among the reasons we have for seeing John's agapate allelou as a general
commandment not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that
one occasion and one linking it to the Synoptic Great Commandment is
that we have criticism from Jesus about limiting our love to those whom
we congenially associate with  In Matthew ff we read You have learnt
how it was said 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy  But I
say to you love your enemies  In fact the Leviticus context quoted
does NOT say 'hate your enemy'  it is merely the common human presumption
And Leviticus is at pains to say that the love should extend to strangers
amongst the people of Israel  Luke in expanding on this same Q context
goes on to have Jesus say Even sinners love those who love them 
All of this suggests quite strongly I'd say  that limiting the
scope of the new commandment is not quite what Jesus has in mind  In
short inference leads me to generalizing the actual text to a command
that is in force on Christians and with objects not limited to other
Christians

Trickier than the agapate allelou or Institution of communion there is
the case of the Great Commission where Matthew  Mark  the Twelve
are sent out to evangelize Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close
at hand  The verb is imperative kerussete but the context is rather
specific to the Twelve and there are further specifiers as in Do not
turn your steps to pagan territory and do not enter any Samaritan town
 the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to
Jerusalem which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians
than the previous examples  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING
such an inference what I have to call attention to is that such inference
is NOT justified in the text nor unlike the first two cases I cite by
the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader  Still Paul seems to
have felt obliged to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand
even contrary to Jesus' instructions to the   to the gentiles to
the ends of the earth  So Christians after him have also taken this as
a commandment in the sense of John   Do I accept this  I don't
know  It is surely rather speculative  But you see how the ripples of
inference spread out from the text that is the pretext  Christians may
infer a general commandment applicable to all from what is presented in
the gospels as a specific occasion  I do not necessarily object to this
kind of generalization  but I insist that people who make it must
have an understanding that they are reasoning at some considerable
length from what we actually have in scripture  There are assumptions
involved in this reasoning and these are not themselves scriptural
though people will do their best to justify their assumptions by OTHER
references to scripture  which simply adds MORE inference into the mix

Let's move on to the Great Commandment  that we should love God with
our whole hearts and minds and souls  This is perhaps the Synoptic
equivalent of John's agapate allelou  And yet  it is not PRESENTED
as a commandment in our texts  Rather the context is controversy with
the Pharisees  To cite Matthew ff

	But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees
	they got together and to disconcert him one of them put a question
	Master which is the greatest commandment of the Law

It is by no means obvious here though I accept it as such that Jesus'
answer is meant to be a commandment to Christians  He is answering a
polemic from his enemies   Mark's account in   casts the answer
in a far more positive light as so the scribe in this version says
far more important than any holocaust I need to point out that this word
originates in the context of animal sacrifice forget the Nazis for this
or sacrifice  Luke is intermediate  he has a lawyer posing the question
to disconcert Jesus and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains
 Luke    The contexts here are so confusingly various that one
could be forgiven for drawing no inferences   In no account is this
said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on
Christians  though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each
case that Jesus thinks it to be so  The point is that our mental gears
HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about
what WE are commanded to do by Jesus  And all of this is contingent on
our understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the all quite
different gospel accounts and the application of such a context to us

The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious  It should be noted
that ONLY in Luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of
the Good Samaritan  We may look for an analogous intent in Matthew where
 gives the Golden Rule as the meaning of the Law and the Prophets
and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same a generation
before Jesus  If we make these associations which I think are entirely
reasonable we are  again  indulging in inference  The texts do not
explicitly support us rather we read the texts as having this kind of
interrelationship  Current literary theory calls this intertextuality

My discussion of why the agapate allelou has to apply beyond the 
community of the disciples and beyound the circle of Christian believers
applies again here to buttress a conclusion that this is despite the
presentation not saying so explicitly a commandment to Christians
Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions  but I must point
out that they are conclusions they depend on rather elaborate chains
of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts themselves

The contextual problem keeps coming up more and more severely as we look at
those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as 
commandments  And we get some really hard cases  Take divorce  Mark is 
pretty clear The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty
of adultery against her    cf Luke    except that Matthew
has an escape clause  except in the case of fornication   This
seems to be a rather clear commandment whether or not we take Matthew's
reservation and some Christians to this day take it so  But some don't
at least in practice  This is rather peculiar it is not as if Jesus were
not explicit about this whereas He says nothing at all about some of the
things people gnash their teeth over  How is it possible if the commands
of Christ are clear that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists
of the synoptic tradition

I'm going to continue this examination into evermurkier waters but this
is enough to start with  The theme is finding commandments in scripture
is an exercise in inference our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions
that is our own cultural biases  I have so far identified a very few
commandments that are generally accepted by all Christians  and yet in
these already some of the difficulties start to surface  It is these
difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic  The divorce
commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties I see almost no
evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn
me with spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soccouples or
misclegal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce or demanding that
US law refuse to allow it or refuse unrepentant divorcees places in
their churches   That is not to say that divorce doesn't enter into 
consideration in general  it is most definitely a matter of concern in
even the most liberal church circles  For example a wildly liberal
Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence in a wildly liberal diocese has
recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a
private secular ceremony before a judge so that the public ceremony
he celebrated need not go through an agonizing examination by officials
who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands
we are faced with as Christians  This in a church that was effectively
CREATED by a famous divorce

NUNNALLYacshardingedu John Nunnally writes
 When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question 
 In paraphrase 
 On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they
 are above the Law and above the Prophets  major and  minor and not 
 accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion 
 in Matthew  What is the source of this pseudodoctrine Who is
 the pseudoteacher Who is the Great Deceiver
OK here's at least one Christian's answer
Jesus was a JEW not a Christian  In this context Matthew  makes
sense  Matt  Do not think that I Jesus came to abolish the Law or
the Prophets I did not come to abolish but to fulfill  Jesus lived
under the Jewish law  However He was the culmination of the promises
of the Prophets  He came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey
God's purposes
Verse  says For truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass
away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law
until all is accomplished  The key to this verse IMHO is the last 
phrase  Jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the 
Law was supposed to accomplish  

Jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the Law and unless
I'm mistaken heaven and earth have not yet passed away Am I mistaken
And even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word
of Jesus do you really think that all is accomplished

Verse   Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments
and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven
but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish 
people about living lives under the law this makes sense

Then why didn't Jesus say Any Jew who annuls  in v  Are you
saying that all of Jesus' recorded words mean nothing to Gentiles Are
you really saying that Jesus only spoke for and to the Jews Jesus
didn't mention your name does that mean he wasn't speaking to you When
you read the words of Jesus do you think he is speaking to someone
other than you

In general it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about doing away with the Law  That was not 
Jesus' intent at all

You said above that Jesus was the fulfillment of the Law Are you
saying that does not mean doing away with the Law

He had come to earth to live the Law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his 
people all the way back to Eve Gen The serpent will bruise your 
heel but He will bruise his head

GenJPS I will put enmity between you and the woman and between
your offspring and hers they shall strike at your head and you shall
strike at their heel

GenNRSV I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your
offspring and hers he will strike your head and you will strike his
heel

GenKJV And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and
between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
bruise his heel

Looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the Word

Jesus appeared to be doing away with the Law 
because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the Law of God  He regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only 
God's Law
In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law 
and defending himself against his accusors  Almost the entire Sermon 
on the Mount Matt  is dedicated to helping the Jewish people 
understand the true intent of the Law sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions

Only helping the Jewish people

In Galatians  Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the 
Law in this way
 But before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed   Therefore 
the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ that we may be 
justified by faith    But now that faith has come we are no 
longer under a tutor   For you are all sons of God through faith 
in Christ Jesus
I believe this says that after Christ was revealed the Law had 
served it's purpose ie our tutor to lead us to Christ and
now we are no longer under a tutor  The law has been fulfilled 
as Christ said he would do

You are using your interpretation of Paul as an argument against the
clear words of Jesus

God the author of the old Law and the ChristMan Jesus are the same
personality  Therefore the old Law and the new Testament the last
will and testament of Jesus are based on the same moral principles 
It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are
reexpressed in Christianity 

Reexpressed Care to define that a bit better

On the other hand now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and 

What Are heaven and earth gone away Where did they go Is all
accomplished for example Revelations Explain please

Christians relate to God through Christ not the Law it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the mysteries of this new relationship  ie Baptism 
representing Christ's death burial and resurrection Rom 
The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice I Cor  and
Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection Matt ff
Acts 

Again your interpretation of Paul versus the clear word of Jesus Do
you see any problems here When did heaven and earth go away When was
all accomplished

OK That's one Christian's explanation  I don't claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome
other Christians to offer other alternatives
Please excuse the long posting  Thanks for your interest if you have read 
this far

	Would someone be kind enought to document the exact
nature of the evidence against the BD's without reference to
hearsay or newsreports I would also like to know more about
their past record etc but again based on solid not media
reports 

	My reason for asking for such evidence is that last night
on Larry King Live a socalled cultexpert was interviewed from
Australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the
original raid This admission if true raises the nasty
possibility that the Government acted in good faith which I
believe they did on faulty evidence It also raises the
possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising
them and giving ver poor advice

	A few years ago Anson Shupe and David Bromley published
STRANGE GODS THE GREAT AMERICAN CULT SCARE Beacon Boston 
 and THE NEW VIGILANTES ANTICULTISTS AND NEW RELIGIONS Sage
Beverly Hills  Both books suggested the possibility of

I can certainly see opposing the Amen  but that doesn't require 
opposing a moment of silence

If the ONLY people proposing a moment of silence are doing so as a
sham to sneak in prayers then it MUST be opposed  What the HELL have
prayers to do with public schooling  I ask this question as a devout
Christian

I'll back off when they do

Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here  I guarantee
you the people who want school prayer aren't going to back off when
they can't even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray
silently

Their kids can bloodywell pray any Goddamned time they WANT to  And
nothing on heaven or earth in government or the principal's office
can prevent or in any other way deal with their doing so  Especially
if the prayer is silent as bursting out into the Shema Yisrael or
some other prayer might be construed as disruptive if audible 
No one ever prevented ME from praying in public school  They hardly
even prevented me from masturbating in study hall

I should have thought better of someone posting from a UChicago address
How can you manage to say such nonsense without shame

Muslim students might have a complaint if they are prevented from setting
out their rugs and doing the proper ablutions before prayer at the times
specified in the Qu'ran  Jews would probably like the opportunity to daven
with tefillim and whatever else they require at their appropriate times
I do not see THEM complaining though Muslims and Jews have a case that no
Christian I have ever heard has been able to make

The Christian insistence on a PUBLIC UNIVERSAL ENFORCED moment of
prayerHHHHHHsilence is nothing but the Inquisition naturalized
into the American context  It is offensive to the Gospel of Christ

I can certainly see opposing the Amen  but that doesn't require

I already responded to this on one dimension but afterthoughts cause
me to make another independent reply  The problem with a moment of
silence is that it is NOT an evenhanded way of allowing for religion
amongst students in the public schools  As I noted before Muslims need
more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are
required by Muhammad to do  And at least Orthodox Jewish prayer also
has requirements that are not addressed by this

There is in fact a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in
this moment of silence shit  And that is especially bizarre in that
Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff  a Christain may pray totally
incognito AT ANY TIME to some extent this is true of Muslims and Jews
as well  what I intend in my first paragraph is that there are some
characteristic forms of prayer in these religions which DO need special
times andor behavior which cannot be undertaken without an observer 
being able taking note of it

A Christian may pray at ANY time  silently and without any trace of
his activity being evident to others  That may or may not be true of the
other religious traditions amongst us certainly these tend to have SOME
forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from AmericanProtestant
mainstream religion

All that a moment of silence does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which
doesn't NEED it to have a special place set aside in the public schools
There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms or rugs
or phylacteries or anything else at all visible to the outside world  A
Christian student MAY and probably does pray at innumerable times during
the day without anyone else knowing it  That may also be true of non
Christians  I am not claimng otherwise  In the moment of silence it
would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven for the Muslims
to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed
forms  But of course Christians can do their thing  and therefore
the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that

Luckily there is a strong Jewish presence in this country and I as
a Christian revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools
and a growing Muslim presence as well  I can only hope that the political
forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms
on nonChristians

As far as I can see as a Christian there is NOTHING in this moment of
silence campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE
children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity  And
as a Christian I must protest such coercion  For what it's worth I
suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the nonChristians 
it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in making
their children prayerful so that they want the public schools to teach
what THEY cannot manage to teach despite having all the opportunity in
the world to do so

If you have taught your children to pray they do NOT need a moment of
silence in school  If you have NOT managed to teach them the moment
will only embarrass you  Give it up

Jesus

     This is the verdict  Light has come into the world but
     men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds
     are evil  Everyone who does evil hates the light and will
     not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be 
     exposed

Kent Sandvik says

It seems we are dealing with a blackandwhite interpretation
Brian are you subtly accusing me of evil things because I never
saw the light However this is even more confusing because
I even admit that I don't like the situation where I'm not 
informed

Black and white  A spade is a spade  There is no hidden
agenda behind this so stop trying to look for one   It is an
easy and as straight forward as it reads

Kent I am not accusing you of evil things  Jesus is accusing you
And it is not only you that He is accusing  He is accusing everyone
Me you and everyone in the world is guilty  Whether one
sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with 
whether we do evil things  We do them regardless  

Jesus uses the word men  I am included  Jesus is not soloing you out
Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man
Christians are not immuned from doing evil things  A Christian 
is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells  A Christian 
can see the evil he is doingbecause his evil has been brought
out into the light  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been
exposed that the Christian will stop doing evil  If you haven't
seen Jesus's light your evil deeds simply haven't been
exposed to the His light  You may shed some light on your
own  Your human spirit shines at perhaps  candela  But the
Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela  The Holy Spirit can
shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know
existed 

So do you see Jesus's point  Christians are not perfect  Nonchristians
are not perfect  Nonchristians do not want to come into the
Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives
and they will not like the sight  It is an ugly thing to see how far
we have fallen from Jesus's perspective  Do you think you want to
know how really ignorant you are  Do you think Brian Kendig wants
to know  Do you think I want to know  Ego verses the truth
which do you choose

I'm watching the news about a man who saw the light and made
sure that the  children burned to death as part of his insight
into the light I don't think the world is that simple And if 
you act in such ways when you are enlighted then I'm a happy
man and I pray I will never receive such 'light'

And I watched Koresh too an imposter who thought he saw the light 
who made sure that the  children burned to death sadly as part
of his delusion  It is even sadder that the people who
died with him chose to die with them and that ignorance was
their downfall to death 

And Kent don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an
excuse like bringing up Koreshas if Koresh actually had truth in him
David Koresh was no light and no excuse for
you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ  David Koresh who
claimed to be Jesus was a fraud  It was obvious  David Koresh
was born in America Jesus was born in Bethlehem  Koresh wasn't
even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that

Jesus warned of such imposters in the endtimes  David
Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus  Jesus told us to be
aware of imposters  years ago  

So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to
be Jesus  Ask the obvious  Where were you born  Was your
mother's name Mary  If the Branch Davidians asked that
simple question they would have labeled Koresh a liar
right from the start  The wouldn't have followed Koresh
They wouldn't have died  But look what happened  Their
ignorance cost them their lives  Their choice to be ignorant
cost them a lot

Kent since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism do you
not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus  
Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context  Do you
remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt
Eve  Did he not misquote God  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded 
was the same ploy he tried on Jesus  But in Jesus's case
Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible in context  It
didn't work with Jesus  

Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan
tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what
Koresh did to his followers  Who did Koresh emulate
Who was Koresh's teacher  Koresh did to his followers what
Satan did to Eve  Did not Koresh kill his followersr  Did
not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well  Did not
the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew
the real Christ was born in Bethlehem   Did not Eve
choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil despite knowing that it would cause her death  God
held them all responsibledeceiver and the rebeller  None 
of them had an excuse  

As opposed to the Branch Davidians we have a second chance
Follow Jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life
Don't follow Jesus and you stand condemned already for like
the Branch Davidian complex your house is already on fire
Satan Adam and Eve have already set it ablaze   It is just
a slow burn but it is burning nevertheless

I also heard the Romans had a large Solar festival on this day because this
day about  days after the Winter Solstice was when you could notice a

Gedaliah Friedenberg friedenbmapleegrmsuedu writes
As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

Please allow me to explain myself  In  the governor of Missouri
governor Boggs issued his socalled Mormon extermination order  The
only crime illegal activity the Latterday Saints had committed was
their religious affiliation their antislave stance Missouri still
allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in Missouri

I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow
to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience
brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements

It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
average people and that at the time almost all Americans were pretty
homogeonously Christian It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust
at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred

True but that is exactly the problem the Mormon extermination order
was issued not just by a Christian it was ALLOWED under the Constitution
of the United States which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents
like this order from occurring in the first place  As I indicated in
an earlier posting your irrational hatred is clearly evidenced by
individuals like Robert Weiss who could have been Gov Boggs' Lieutenant
he would have fitted right in drewling et al and seems a modernday
occurrence based on results slander persecution misrepresentation
lies denying Mormons representation in their own user group etc etc

In intent and purpose what really has changed

The situation is not entirely different today  Many irrational feelings
and beliefs are justified through religion  I don't think most of them
are started because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and
perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification
which discourages critical thought

True as evidenced by numerous examples as I am sure you're aware

In any regard Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from
being trusted or righteous  Have things really changed for the better  I
may be a born cynic but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case In the early s I believe the late President Kimball lds church
leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MXPeace Keeper
missile maze from being built in Utah yet another inspired decision from
secular authorities  Fortunately his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off

Do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of
people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassingeradicating the
Mormons  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
nuclear testing etc was to get them thar Mormons  And what about the
majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons  You seem to be searching for enemy
 
Correction the majority of Utahn's ARE Mormon  I believe up to a
  in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states

conspiracies  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you
badly must have been done primarily for that purpose

What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched as we believe
that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert
truth judgment and justice  In addition we believe that the adversary
has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be
a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and
evil combinations  As an intelligent being don't you suppose that the
destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power

As far as Utah is concerned what I pointed out were some horrible examples
of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities which have
brought death disease ie the downwinders and environmental contami
nation  I am hardly paranoid I am just not expecting too much from a
secular government that may not share our values and faith and which indeed
as Gov Boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy us  As a matter of
fact prophecies in my church indicate that in future years global
persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope that
paraphrasing all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must
flee to Zion  Zion the pure in heart will be reestablished in those
days and it AIN'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it

  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with
John I too wonder who or what's next

I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
life of even one person  Sure he did not pose a threat to the security of
this nation  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers  That
much is definite

Hmmm  definite by whom  Until such has been established beyond reason
able doubt this alleged threat may have been less than the threat
imposed upon him and his followers by the BATF and FBI

Who killed who  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound
What REALLY caused the murder of the little children  Could it be that
the ATFFBI presence has any bearing upon the events  How would you
interpret the Mt Masada events  Blame the Jews  What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway  What business did the ATFFBI has in Waco
Texas  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
team in   In that case the police botched the job as well  But to
lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible
mistake  I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case
Certainly if David Koresh chose any peaceful option the ATF and FBI
would have complied  The responsibility is more his than the authorities

Come now at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise
peaceful standoff let's get it over with and force David Koresh to
come out  By gassing them  Were they naive or what  They played
right into the hands of an apocalypticthinking individual he had prepared
his people for this eventuality for years and not one firetruck or plan
was in place to deal with this scenario  I feel that the authorities
had some responsibility to protect their own citizens even if they were
religious zealots and guilty of  not paying a  gun license
Has the BATF become an extension of the local taxcollectors

David Koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the
executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers

Characterizing the ATFFBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair  In
order to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent
to kill

Que Intrusion into private property with semi's loaded with life
ammunition isn't that implicit intent or at least prepared to kill
I ask you would the BATF warrant stand up in a civil court of justice
I do not mind if criminals such as dangerous drug lords are brought to
justice but escalating events to the point of allowing to if not compli
city with the destruction of a people

        Just thought I'd clear up a few of the murky areas

Actually after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo and later Carthage
the Mormons DID fortify Utah  They still arm themselves to defend the
faith and stockpile food as well  They have been involved in quite a
lot of illegal activity  including multiple and often underage wives
for the leaders  a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their
sect  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking
                                         

By they you mean the leaders of the lds church  I grant you that when
Joseph Smith was still alive plenty of accusations were filed most of
which had little bearing with reality as evidenced by various verdicts
I have studied lds history for  years now and I have yet to see prove
that the lds leadership was involved in quote illegal activities
Plural marriage yes but your charge of underage wives sounds like it
could have originated from a tabloid and discredits the high moral
standards which characterized these leaders and families unlike as it
appears those of David Koresh

        Joseph Smith started the sect  After he and his brother Hyram
were murdered in a Nauvoo Il jail cell church membership split over
who to follow  Initially Smith was considered a prophet just like
Mohammed a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider
Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews I'm led to understand  Make
no mistake this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith  The

And neither did he claim he was  As the church reflects the moral
aptitude of its leaders and especially those of Joseph Smith I have
nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man whose only crime
was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision  Many have tried
to explain the Smith phenomenon away but the bold presence of an 
million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's
testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message

thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed
down father to son  After Joseph Smith died his son was only
entering his teens  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have
been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death  The
Council of Twelve the Church governing body wasn't of much help
here and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects
Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake  The rest waited
for Smith Jr to grow up enough to assume leadership  The other
claimants to the leadership were soon ignored like Mike Dukakis 

The rest were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church
while the great majority of the membership the Twelve and the various
auxiliary organizations chose to accept Brigham Young as the new
prophet and leader of the Church  If you knew your lds scriptures and
doctrine you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in
line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy he was the senior
apostle in the Quorum and various comments made by Joseph indicated
that it was Brigham who would lead the latterday exodus to the West

Other rightful heirs were either dead Hyrum Smith or excommunicated
Oliver Cowdery and while persecutions abounded and intensified
Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place an empty
land beyond the boundaries of the United States at that time  This
Rekhabite principle pseudographia was well understood and antipated
by the great majority of lds faithful and was not questioned by them

Granted a couple of doityourselfers stayed behind unwilling to
sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown but
this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat  The
church benefitted from this purification process they became even
more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world

        Both sects practiced the year food stockpile doctrine
and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at
least owned weapons  There is little evidence that they were a
militaristic sect given that they tended to move on rather than
face largescale opposition  Brigham Young having suffered a
great deal getting to Salt Lake seems to have been quite
justified in making military training a good thing  Remember
this was far beyond where even the US Army went and these people
had nobody to turn to save themselves

        Just a little context to put this all in perspective

BTW since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints one of
the largest denominations in the country a sect  It didn't splinter
from any other religion as did say the Southern Baptists or Methodists

So what did the Mormons get  It seems that J Edgar Hoover was very
impressed with the way they kept secrets  They're pledged to defend
secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood  Many actually
do  even to the point of suicide

What a balloney  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God  I am
not comfortable with this alleged cosiness with Mammon I assure you
that many among us reject this attitude categorically  Period  Our
ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has
appointed to represent Him  In any regard to read this TRASH about
suicide and atone for sins with blood is yet another insulting
misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for


        The RLDS the Reorganized LDS are friendly rivals of the LDS
and delight in telling stories about them which generates quick retorts
from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time  At no time have
I ever even heard this hinted at  I'm taking it with a salt block

Make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top

  So he hired virtually no one but
Mormons until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the
Church of Later Day Saints  Though J Edgar is finally gone the FBI
personnel especially the field agents are still heavily Mormon
I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment
of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical

Preposterous  Even if this were true reliable data please I
am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes
of honor and conduct that's why they were selected for in the
first place remember  Besides one of our Articles of Faith
STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion and that all
people are free to worship how where or what they may

        If it's true there would be little affect  LDS and RLDS
philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
Church as set down by Jesus but that God will judge each on his
own merits  In addition the RLDS also contend and the LDS may
as well that ignorance of the True Way tm is an excuse  You
can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected
it  In short LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to
Buddhists secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they
will not be penalized for ignorance  It is more likely that Hoover
liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade
alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like
These people are the salt of the Earth and as such are more
easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them

A good explanation I can accept that  You are right that lds people
are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's orders the late
president Kimball for example was an exception with his strong
opposition of the selection of the MX Peace Keeper missile maze
in Utah

        That's my somewhat educated guess anyway  Both sects have
splinter groups that don't mirror the masses but these are small
and rare and hardly worth noting their common ancestry

        None of this has any relevance to guns though  When a
man's religion is used to deny him the right of selfprotection with
the weapons suitable for the job he'll find an ally in me

They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

How do you know Were you there

While obviously Koresh was a nut case the typical inability of the
governmentmedia to get its story straight is quite disturbing On
tuesday night NBC news reported that the FBI did not know the place
was burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from the
building The next day FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians
setting the fire The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible
their battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set the
blaze while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating
of the site because it was still too hot So how did they KNOW they
didnt accidentally set the fire

Sounds like the FBI just burned the place to the ground to destroy
evidence to me

So are you happy now when  people including innocent kids
died today

No and Im especially unhappy that these  people died in an assault
on private property with government armored vehicles

I am also unhappy or actually very suspicious that the FBI was dismissing
out of hand any chances that they might have accidentally set the blaze 
themselves I mean I guess we are just supposed to believe that
ramming modified tanks into the walls of a building and injecting
toxic gases into the building are just routine procedures no WAY
anything could go wrong

	I do not believe that there is such a thing as nontoxic tear
gas


You are correct See today's  Washington Post The gas the
FBI used is most certainly fatal in high concentrations Of course
nontoxic tear gas is an oxymoron the whole point of tear gas is
that it is toxic and its toxic effects cause people to seek
fresh air

We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes
that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly
considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil 
rights Among these are drug abuse sexual perversion and political 
incorrectness
Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants He had been accused of
a number of differing crimes inconsistantly over the last two months but 
this is the first time I have heard that one I had heard child abuse but
this is somewhat stronger
It is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children and ironicly
considering his apocalyptic dread believed enough in the American People's
inherent goodness to believe he was protected
It is truly amazing that all these people who  days ago had never heard of 
the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal crazy a child abuser and 
a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons
had said Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found
that they have screwed up 
But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost
For in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes

                     Welcome to the Peace Run

                     You're invited to join in
                     a Global Relay Run and
                     help light the Way



                       Why the Peace Run  

There's a new spirit in the Nineties a spirit of oneness a growing
belief in the possibility of true global peace

The goal of the Sri Chinmoy OnenessHome Peace Run is simple to
bring this spirit forward in a concrete way to transform it into
a reality in their own lives

Every other year thousands of men women and children from more
than  nations  passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand 
join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe
Transcending political and cultural boundaries they go from
nation to nation  across mountains jungles and deserts  carrying
the message of brotherhood to all humankind

Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path
for those who follow Each time the Peace Torch changes hands the
flame of oneness burns a little brighter  until one day it will
shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth


		      Making History  

The three Peace Runs since  have achieved some historic break
throughs in the Middle East a landmark run crossed the Egyptian
Israeli border in Europe a precedentsetting run linked Eastern
and Western Europe with Russia in the United States Mexico and
Canada entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace
and in Poland the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II


		   Speaking as One World  
               Leaders Celebrities  and You  

The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over 
Presidents Prime Ministers religious leaders sports figures and
entertainment personalities

Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper
reports magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts including
specials on PBS MTV and NBC's Today Show

 I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice peace and
reconciliation The world must know that God wants us to live
amicably as brothers and sisters members of one family the human
family God's family   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
			  Nobel Peace Prize Winner


		     How It All Works  

Peace Run  started with a fiveborrough relay in New York
City on Saturday April  converging at various points to lead
up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag
Hammarskjold Building There runners from around the world
were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch

From there Peace Torches are now being transported to over
seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or
crosscountry relay runs including the United States Canada
Japan Australia Russia and Eastern and Western Europe Smaller
runs will take place in the Philippines Mexico Israel South
America Egypt and elsewhere in Africa Distance to be covered
 miles

The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate
the minds of those who support participate in witness or hear
about the event   Carl Lewis
                     SixTime Olympic Gold Medalist


                    Who's Behind It  

The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team an
international running organization that believes sports can be a
powerful instrument for promoting world peace Each year the Team
puts on hundreds of athletic events including several worldclass
ultramarathons marathons and triathlons in dozens of countries

The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador
Sri Chinmoy who has written and lectured extensively on peace
offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless
world figures to advance the cause of international harmony

The Run is managed by Peace Runs International a nonprofit
organization based in the United States


                 Take a Step For Peace  

The Peace Runs in   and  attracted nearly half a
million participants We're expecting even more people to join
Peace Run '

You can also join the Run  carrying the Peace Torch a few steps
a few blocks or a few miles Or you can come out and cheer the
runners as they carry the Torch through your community

You can also join local celebrities and government officials in
one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the
nation route

Your inner support is important too If you're a runner each time
you go out you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace

Bill I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert  By biblical
scholar I mean
an expert who in the course of his or her research is willing to let
the
chips fall where they may  This excludes literalists who may
otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists  They find what they want to find 
They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others

I've seen this claim about the Josephus insert flying around the
net too often to continue to ignore it  Perhaps it's true  Was
there only one Josephus manuscipt  If there were say  copies
the forger would have to put his insert into all of them  By the
same token since Josephus was a historian why are biblical scholars
raising the flag  Historical scholars  I would think would have
a better handle on these ancient secular documents  Can you give 
researchers documents page numbers etc

Jack

I became aware of the claim years ago  So I decided to check it out on my
own  But then that was in BN times Before Net  So here are some 
references  See Robin Lane Fox's The unauthorized version p where 
Lane Fox writes  the one passage which appears to comment on Jesus' 
career is agreed to be a Christian addition

In my ReAlbert Sabin response CusJsunfishusdedu to Jim Lippard 
April  I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine 
Pagel's The gnostic gospels p to wit  A comment attributed to
Josephus reports  emphasis mine  Scholars sometimes do not even mention
the two Josephus entries another subtlety reflecting consensus

So far as I can deduce today's consensus is built on at least three things 
 the long passage is way out of context  Origen did not know about the
long passage and  the short and long passages are contradictory 
I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are
orginally developed does anyone

Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians  The
former like the latter incorporate historical social technological and
ideological contexts as well as theology  So the distinction is blurred  I 
didn't elaborate on that  Sorry  In turn historians are compelled to
incorporate theology

Can't say about the number of copies  These were however BG times Before 
Gutenburg  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high counting on one 
hand seems more reasonable  Perhaps those mss without the long insert if any
because anything is possible have been destroyed  Such a practice is 
certainly not foreign to religions  Anyway all we have are mss which have 
the two entries  Lippart in the message noted above talks about an Arabic 
ms  But here the ms date is critical

Assuming for the moment that the FBI believed in the bible and

that God is the one who has to open the seals not some

Fear doesn't usually follow reason  By the way why do you call

he's just some wierdo

Jesus' comments about how Christians have to follow the OT deleted

I will clarify my earlier quote  God's laws were originally written for 
the Israelites  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
all people not just the Jews  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
Heaven through the saving grace of God  I never said that the Law was made
obsolete by Jesus

Exodus   How many people have you put to death for working on
the Sabbath

If anything He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made  In the
following verses Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended  If you'll notice He
also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived
interpretations  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their
heads but not their hearts  That is why He points out that our righteousness
must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
of Heaven  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their
way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin
They had become legalistic rulemakers  religious lawyers who practiced the
letter of the Law but never really believed in it  

Leviticus   How as that mediumrare steak last night

I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world a lot of
modernday Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart

Leviticus   What did you wear to work friday

Christianity is not just a set of rules it's a lifestyle that changes one's
perspectives and personal conduct  And it demands obedience to God's will

Deutromony   I can you can now justify discrimination

Some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  That is their
choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too

Right

In response to WhittenFwvaSaicCom David Whitten

I wrote

There evidently was a feast of bread and wine associated with Mithras  I
have often wondered if Yeshua intentionally introduced this ritual to
expand the appeal of his religion or if it was appropriated by later
worshipers

And you responded

You could argue that if you wanted but I think a more reasonable 
argument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast was
very similar to the Pesach Passover meal during Seder a very
Jewish ritual

Of course  The feast WAS the Seder and the accounts of it are very clear
on this point

The difference is the connection between the bread and wine and the body
and blood of god  This is an old association of the TammuzOsirisMithras
line and not really related to Judaism  In any case I didn't really
intend to argue the point  I saw a possible association and pointed it
out but I haven't the foggiest notion what really happened

Actually both are positive arguments  Positive may not be the best

is true  The default condition in the absence of a preponderance of
evidence either way is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable
And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that heshe
simply disbelieves that the proposition is true is the only one who
holds no burden of proof  This is why the socalled weak atheist
position is virtually unassailable  not because it stands on a firm
foundation of logical argument but because it's proponents simply
disbelieve in the existence of Gods and therefore they hold no burden
of proof  When you don't assert anything you don't have to prove
anything  That's where weak atheism draws its strength  But its

Andy I think we do agree given your clarification of how we were 
each using the terms fact and theory  I'll only add that I
think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them
though your usage is quite valid

Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory  In other words it
could theoretically still be falsified and rejected  But since it's
so predictive and so consistently supported by evidence it seems
pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore

I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way
reduce its current usefulness  So long as it accurately predicts or 
describes things we can observe

Not to be a pain in the ass but is there any reason you don't
just say the theory of evolution rather than the fact of evolution
is still a theory  I'm asking because this whole thread got started
because I was bothered by a post that referred to the fact of evolution
basically leaving off the phrase is still a theory  Without a 
clarification like the one you just gave just saying the fact of
evolution has a very different meaning to me

description of atomic theory and alternative theories of gravity deleted
Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it

Here is where you fail to make an important distinction  You have
shoehorned the facts of the existence of gravity and atoms and
evolution into one category with the theories which have been
proposed to explain the mechanisms  The existence of these things
is so predictive as to be considered fact  The mechanisms on the
other hand are still worth discussing  

I'm not sure I agree here  Again it may be because I feel stronger
about separating terms  I was trying to say that the theories
proposed to explain the mechanisms and the mechanisms themselves
are the only realities here  It is the existence of mechanisms not 
the things themselves that are so predictive as to be considered 
fact as you would say  There aren't really little planetary particle 
systems called atoms out there  Or I should say and more to my original 
point it would be a leap of faith to say there are because we observe only 
the mechanisms  There is no need to believe there are actually
atoms out there as we have decided to think about them  It's enough
to discuss the mechanisms  At any rate I'm not sure I am being 
any clearer than before but I thought it was worth a shot

The bottom line though is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas

    evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence my way
      the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational
        evidence your way

    creation is just an opinion  If a theist wants to call it
        a theory then he can  I won't  it has no supporting evidence 
	and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can
        be made  With no mechanisms to talk about there really isn't
	much to say

Do you agree

Speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that
will result in the same value measured no matter the reference  A 
bullet with zero velocity sitting on a table on a train moving mph
will be moving at a speed of

        a mph to someone on the train
        b mph to someone stationary next to the train

The reference frame makes the speed relative  But what's interesting
here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet
Every person off a bullet moving mph  

I know of no train where all the people on it every time it is
filled will see a moral problem in exactly the same way

There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre  In sum Ezekiel prophesied
that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt as there are a lot of
people living there it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct

This doesn't bother me at all because I understand the language Ezekiel used
differently than do socalled Biblical literalists  For example it sometimes
happens that someone says My grandson is the cutest baby and then turns
around and sees the granddaughter and says Oh  Isn't she the cutest thing

This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the
world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for
first  Rather he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very
objectoriented  Because this example is one that is common to many people
nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements the Bible however is
often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly
literally true  For those people the existence of Tyre is a problem for me
it is not


Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel we read this from
John E King

 The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the
 area

No it implies nothing of the kind  If you had nothing but the prophecy from
Ezekiel and you were told you interpret it literally you would never say
Oh he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff
like that  You would read I will make you a bare rock and You will never
be rebuilt and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock  The only way
to get from fishing nets' to houses and buildings and a mediumlarge
population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there

In other words your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the
prophecy at the time it was written  There is no way that given a literal
reading they could read this passage and conclude mediumsize city

You seem to feel that Never be rebuilt means be rebuilt  maybe so but
it is hardly a clear implication'


Mr King also writes

 So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from  to 
 Let's assume the latter one is correct  By modern standards
 we are talking about a onehorse town

Well no  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis where I'm
from  You know the Naval Acadamy the state capital George Washington
resigned his commission in the statehouse  Annapolis may not be New York but
it's at least a twohorse town

But supposing  people is a small town  it's still  people
MORE than Ezekiel predicted


And you've said nothing about the other problem  In chapter  Ezekiel
predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their
valuables  However Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre and in chapter 
Ezekiel even quotes God as saying he and his army got no reward from the
campaign he led against Tyre

Let's ignore Alexander for a moment and just pay attention to chapter 
Ezekiel says N would destroy Tyre and N did NOT destroy Tyre  Ezekiel says
that N would plunder their valuables but N did NOT plunder their valuables

Regardless of what you think about Tyre now the fact is that N died before
the place was destroyed  Ezekiel said N was going to do it and N did not

 

This post is of course pointless  Inerrantists have an amazing ability
to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say

For example I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 
by pulling some clear implications out of hat

When Ezekiel said that N would demolish your towers that clearly implied
that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers
used to be  And when Ezekiel said that N would demolish your fine houses
and throw your stones timber and rubble into the sea that clearly implied
that N would never set foot on the island  And when Ezekiel wrote that N
would build a ramp up to your walls that clearly implies that N would
spend  years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the
walls

See  A few clear implications that are totally contrary to the text and
you can reconcile anything you want

Tice the Cotera Joe Gaut et alapologies if I've mislabelled any
of you I've only started reading trm since the BD disaster  But I
know the Cotera is a fundy and are defending Koresh and his beliefs
as an example of True Christianity under persecution from the the Big
Bad Secular State what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits
If the reports are accurate what IYO does this say about the quality of
his Christianity  Or are the allegations just part of the Big
CoverUp

I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire I wouldn't
put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself  On the other
hand if the propanetankaccident story is correct I wouldn't put it
past the FBI to try to cover its ass by claiming Koresh did it  I
hope your government does a VERY thorough investigation of the whole
debacle and I'll be disappointed if a few heads don't roll  The
authorities seem to have botched the original raid and in the matter
of the fire are guilty of either serious misjudgement or reckless
endangerment

I'm not expert on Christianity but I know a little about history
and how the repeated instances of Messianic figures jesus was neither
the first last nor most serious of those pretenders related
to the history of the period

A messiah in those days was to bring salvation from the Romans
He was supposed to reclaim Israel and Judaea bring the Israelites
back from what is now IraqPersiaAfghanistan and do so
not only by faith but by real war  Any Messianic pretender
would tell his followers to get ready for war since they
were going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free the
Israelites

For those interested Bar Kochba's claim was taken far more
seriously than Jesus' among the Jews  They revolted and
 were slaughtered by the Romans  His claim was only
rejected after his defeat although for a short time he looked
as though he would win  They even got to mint coins before
the Romans triumphed

Now how that has played into Christianity is rather interesting
given your use of the statement attributed to Jesus  Did Koresh
figure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel
Had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants of
the Israelites one hint almost none of them are Christians
look at the three countries listed above they were their
and Jewish until at least the th century

Brian C don't you see  I do not believe that your god is

	a real or even

	b beneficial

In fact I believe your religion is imaginary and carried to
extremes harmful  I would like to help you see its shortcomings and
perhaps someday finally become strong enough to see it for what it is
an elaborate lie kept alive by the elite priesthood to keep the
masses properly submissive to their influences

Please offer me an argument that's more convincing than you just
don't believe 'cos you don't want to  Everything you've said so far
could apply equally to any religion  why do you believe yours is the
real one

Note that saying it's the only one that promises eternal life or
something like that isn't an answer to my question unless you show
that a no other religion promises eternal life and b it is
unarguably true that eternal life must be a reality

  This is quite different from saying Employing force on other people
  is immoral period   Unfortunately from time to time we are obliged
  to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
  we have to bear the moral consequences of that
  
  Since both statements to all intents and purposes say effectively
  the same thing 
 
 Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force
 in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is
 not moral say effectively the same thing
 
 Yes when you tag on the Unfortunately  then to all intents and
 purposes you are saying the same thing

Then delete the unfortunately   Now tell me that the two statement
say effectively the same thing

And to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop please notice
that we are only obliged to use force to preserve self   We can choose
not to preserve self which is the point of pacifism

 
 Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and
 the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two 
 statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when
 they say effectively the same thing
 
 What they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator

And in this case they don't prescribe the same things so

 
                   and lead one to do precisely the same thing then 
  either both statements are doublespeak or none
 
 They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what
 motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
 same thing
 
 That's not true  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum 
 force and still be a pacifist  If the minimum is  great   but one is
 always trying to get as close to  force as possible under that belief
 Not the same as 'force is immoral period' but still tending to pacifism

If you don't think the use of force is immoral why minimise its use

I've just spent two solid months arguing that no such thing as an

 When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question 
 
 In paraphrase 
 
 On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they
 are above the Law and above the Prophets  major and  minor and not 
 accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion 
 in Matthew  What is the source of this pseudodoctrine Who is
 the pseudoteacher Who is the Great Deceiver

OK here's at least one Christian's answer

Jesus was a JEW not a Christian  In this context Matthew  makes
sense  Matt  Do not think that I Jesus came to abolish the Law or
the Prophets I did not come to abolish but to fulfill  Jesus lived
under the Jewish law  However He was the culmination of the promises
of the Prophets  He came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey
God's purposes

Verse  says For truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass
away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law
until all is accomplished  The key to this verse IMHO is the last 
phrase  Jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the 
Law was supposed to accomplish  

Verse   Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments
and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven
but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish 
people about living lives under the law this makes sense

In general it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about doing away with the Law  That was not 
Jesus' intent at all  He had come to earth to live the Law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his 
people all the way back to Eve Gen The serpent will bruise your 
heel but He will bruise his head  Jesus appeared to be doing 
away with the Law because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the Law of God  He regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only 
God's Law

In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law 
and defending himself against his accusors  Almost the entire Sermon 
on the Mount Matt  is dedicated to helping the Jewish people 
understand the true intent of the Law sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions

In Galatians  Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the 
Law in this way

 But before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed   Therefore 
the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ that we may be 
justified by faith    But now that faith has come we are no 
longer under a tutor   For you are all sons of God through faith 
in Christ Jesus

I believe this says that after Christ was revealed the Law had 
served it's purpose ie our tutor to lead us to Christ and
now we are no longer under a tutor  The law has been fulfilled 
as Christ said he would do

God the author of the old Law and the ChristMan Jesus are the same
personality  Therefore the old Law and the new Testament the last
will and testament of Jesus are based on the same moral principles 
It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are
reexpressed in Christianity 

On the other hand now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and 
Christians relate to God through Christ not the Law it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the mysteries of this new relationship  ie Baptism 
representing Christ's death burial and resurrection Rom 
The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice I Cor  and
Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection Matt ff
Acts 

OK That's one Christian's explanation  I don't claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome
other Christians to offer other alternatives

Please excuse the long posting  Thanks for your interest if you have read 
this far

 So are you happy now when  people including innocent kids
 died today
 
 	It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other
 	One thing for sure  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself
 	against the statements lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification
 	made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him

Frankly speaking I don't care who started this whole show I just 
feel sad about the children that were trapped and had to die
for a case that didn't have any reason whatsoever All Mr 
Koresh could have done would have been to release these 
children 

	COuld he  And the first three that died when guns ablazing in came
	the BATF and FBI

	I imagine I would have some trouble giving up my children to
	someone who had just shot  what  two of them

	NB  It takes two sets of guns in a situation like this


Yes I put the blame on Koresh and similar fanatical religious
leaders that think more about their cause than about keeping

	Fanatical  those whowill not tolerate another's way of life
	Religious  Based on emotional internal or otherwise
		lacking in commonly defined scientific basis
		including legal ones such as this old saw

			Innocent untilproven guilty

		not
			Innocent until presumed guilty

	Who is the fanatic  Note who is dead this usually bespeaks
	a fair bit for the idea that the OTHER side also had lethal
	weapons used fatally

		They are dead  the children
			At best Koresh was an asshole and the government
			criminally negligent in its hadniling of the case

			At worst Koresh and his followers were
				innocent
				not brainwashed
				guilty of illegal arms possession
					as yet unproven
				and murderedd
				along with  children
			They cannot speak for themselves
			Members of the surviving alive and not burned
				to death BATFFBI can and are
				inappropriately
				to the public eye
				outside the bounds of their legal authorities
					read the charter
					the Constitution specifies that
					the COURTS convict while the

					and that the evidence involved
					shuld not be disseminated in a
					way to harm or injure a party
					involved prior to that action
					its called slander or libel
					even where factually true butthen
					distoted or disseminated with intent
					to harm
				for the purpose of covering their butts

			because the bottom line is
				they SAID they wanted the kids to get out
					alive
				and theFBI the BATF Ms Reno the Prez
					and EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS

						SICK
						SELFSERVING
						GROUP OF UPRIGHT ANIMALS
					that used to be a freedom loving
					peaceful country called

						America  look up the name

				has turned the point the finger of blame

				and LET THOSE KIDS DIE

				Note well  they lived  days they only
				died when attacked by outside force

			SPock's World Diane Duane

				The spear in the heart of another
				is the spear in your own 

		ALL of us are responsible

		Iam you are  The question is not whether but how

			Guess what  you get to make up your own mind
			on that

children out from the war zone I'm not ashamed of this statement

	Who created the war zone  You should be ashamed of bypassing that
	It's the same damned Literally comment made by the folks in
	the former Yugoslavia to justify Ethnic Cleansing

		Gee they had the guns all they had to do was surrender


To justify other means does not eliminate the fact that children
died for a cause that they should not have been part of 

	Whose cause did they die for  The one where they lived
	peacibly to all known purposes until proven in COurt
	folks or the Cuase of Righteous Government SafeGuarding 
	The Freedom Of The CHildren

		Who are now dead


	AgainI say

		I do NOT know who did what
		I was NOT there
		The FBI leaders show moral SICKness trying to
			convict in the press ahead of schedule
		And you should look over your shoulder

		becuase if there is anything my ruminations that
		actually  sets onto real fact of what happened

			and I do not know that I am defending
			people who ahving been burned to death cannot
			speak for themselves

		you may in  years find that the concept in our
		Court system  has gone from

			Due Processss

		to

			Due Profit

		and the BATF come to collect their fair share of the tax

They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

	Take a second look at nontoxic nonflammable

		MACE sold tothe public is supposedly nontoxic
		Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly

			I know  my father and grandfather were exposed

		WHat the label ACTUALLY means is

		ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN
		AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER  SOme of the most
		nonflammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME
		if you hit it with the right combo


		Let's take one  a trash can fire  Makes black smoke

		Suck that smoke made up of paper that has carbonized

		conditioning return mix with about  air and light
		a match   feet of conduit is about the same when

			THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING
			TILES IN BUILDINGS  Because  stories of

	So
		Take a little nonflammable aerosol
		Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes

			NO electricity remeber  A bit of heating
			on the WACO plains  Boil water to drink
			since the water was cut off

		liberally mix and allow to settle for  hours

		Fumes vent down into the bus underground and the Davidians
		move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom they had one

	I think that the consensus will become that FBIATF muffed it
not merely because they walked into an ambush on Feb  and Koresh
got his prophesy today against their stated intentions but because
they played right into polarizing the situation and not diffusing
it

	Koresh had set up all the conditions of a classic cult
confrontation and had stated publically what the outcome would become

	Before or after his kids were shot

The government upped the ante and parcipitated the conclusion today
It does seem that the fires were set from within the compound by the
members of the group and not caused by the CS gas or the way it was
delivered Let the subsequent investigation shed light on that Suppose

	Then why make the comment

that the government had used pyrotechnics and started the fire The
Dividians still had the decision to stay or leave They never intended

	As did the Jews against the Nazis in WW II  do what I say or die

to leave

The building burns almost everyone dies  It probably doesn't bother
you much but it bothers many other peoplemost of whom dont believe
particularly in Koresh or his message


	ALl humans I hope


	Yes the finger pointing has begun

	Four ATF agents and  branch Davidians are now dead because of
crazy tactics on the part of the ATF and FBI

	Yeah they blew it They were being too rational in a
situation that was not your ordianry criminal game They haven't learned
that much from Jonestown or The Move House or the SLA shootout

	Or perhaps they have  kill first blame the dead ones
	destroy all the evidence

My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle
and died on Day  of the siege  On Day  of the siege he rose from the
dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over the
next  days  Living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy
as Timmy Baterman's father in PetSematary could attest so after 
days they did what Baterman didshot themselves and burned the place
to the ground

Consistent with the facts isn't it  Did anyone actually see Koresh
between Day  and Day

Brian Kendig says

 And since I felt reasonably sure of myself I decided to start analyzing the
 Bible very closely  That was the catalyst to my break with my faith
 though it was a long and difficult effort

Brian Kendig also declares

 Christ means chosen the person chosen to fulfill the prophesies
 of the Old Testament and bring about a new age of hope and spiritual
 growth for mankind

Christ is Greek for Messiah  Messiah means Annointed One
Annoint means to rub with oil ie to anoint by impl to
consecrate     The major prophet Daniel uses the word Messiah
in Daniel chapter 

How closely did you analyze the Bible  Looks as if you didn't
get past the first word   So was the catalyst to break your faith the
priests who interpreted the Bible for you   Did you ever do what
the Bereans did to Paul's teachings in Acts

Can a theist be truly objective  Can he be impartial
     when questioning the truth of his scriptures or
     will he assume the superstition of his parents
     when questioning 

I've often found it to be the case that the theist
     will stick to some kind of superstition when
     wondering about God and his scriptures  I've
     seen it in the Christian the Jew the Muslim
     and the other theists alike  All assume that
     their mothers and fathers were right in the
     aspect that a god exists and with that belief
     search for their god
     
Occasionally the theist may switch religions or
     aspects of the same religion but overall the
     majority keep to the belief that some Creator
     was behind the universe's existence  I've
     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice
     versa I've known Christians who were once
     Jewish and vice versa and I've even known
     Christians who become Hindu  Yet throughout
     their transition from one faith to another
     they've kept this belief in some form of higher
     being  Why
     
It usually all has to do with how the child is
     brought up  From the time he is born the
     theist is brought up with the notion of the
     truth of some kind of scripture the Bible
     the Torah the Qur'an  etc  He is told
     of this wondrous God who wrote or inspired
     the scripture of the prophets talked about in
     the scripture of the miracles performed  etc
     He is also told that to question this as
     children are apt to do is a sin a crime
     against God and to lose belief in the scrip
     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell
     Thus by the time he is able to read the
     scripture for himself the belief in its truth
     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
     matter of course
     
But it doesn't stop there  Once the child is able
     to read for himself there is an endeavor to
     inculcate the child the right readings of
     scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant
     readings to gloss over the worse ones and to
     explain away the unexplainable with mystery
     Circular arguments selfevdent facts and
     truths unreasoning belief and fear of
     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
     of every day  To doubt of course means wrath
     of some sort and the child must learn to put
     away his brain when the matter concerns God
     All of this has some considerable effect on the
     child so that when he becomes an adult the 
     superstitions he's been taught are nearly
     impossible to remove
     
All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
     truly be objective when questioning God Hell
     Heaven the angels souls and all of the rest
     Can he for a moment put aside this notion that
     God does exist and look at everything from
     a unbiased point of view  Obviously most
     theists can somewhat especially when presented
     with mythical gods Homeric Roman Egyptian
      etc  But can they put aside the assumption
     of God's existence and question it impartially

ra   Robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying
ra things like it is held that cf Kermit thread  On what
ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox

     Orthodox is a compound word It comes from 'orthos' straight true 
     right and from 'doxa' opinion doctrine teaching I use orthodox to 
     refer to 'right teaching' Right teaching is derived from letting God 
     speak to us through the Bible This can be from reading simple truths 
     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible

ra Who is that holds that Luke meant what you said he meant

     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are
     pertinent

     Luke  records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on
     an adjacent cross Truly I say to you today you will be with Me in
     paradise But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead
     and ascended to heaven If Christ Himself was not in heaven until
     Sunday how could the repentant thief have been there with Him The
     answer lies in the location of paradise when Jesus died

     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day

     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and 
     Lazarus as Abraham's Bosom to which the godly beggar Lazarus was
     carried by the angels after his decease Luke   Thus
     Abraham's Bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed
     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection

     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of 
     hades Hebrew Sheol reserved for believers who had died in the faith
     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven
     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary or
     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with
     the Father

     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the
     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon But
     on Sunday after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene
     John  and her two companions Matthew  presumably He then
     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise
     including Abraham Lazarus and the repentant thief We read in
     Ephesians  concerning Christ Ascending on high He led captivity
     captive He gave gifts unto men Verse  continues But what does He
     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the
     earth ie to hades Verse  adds He who descended is the same
     as He who ascended above all the heavens Presumably He led the whole
     band of liberated captives from hades ie the whole population of
     preresurrection paradise up to the glory of heaven

ra Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is
ra challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to
ra look at the Bible in order to see the truth but what of those who
ra see Biblical things differently from you

     I think that this characterization is faulty Whenever my 'personal 
     interpretation' is questioned I usually give a reason

     As for those that see things differently please put forward where
     there is a valid difference and we can discuss it 

     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one 
     views the Bible is somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff 
     that I glean from it Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can 
     have a discussion on that topic But to decry something that I put 
     forward without putting forward something else to discuss and to 
     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious

ra Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
ra understands it

     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is 
     wrong then please show me from Scripture where it is wrong  Simply 
     stating that there are other views is not a proof Show it to me from 
     Scripture and then we can go on

 Kent I am not accusing you of evil things  Jesus is accusing you
 And it is not only you that He is accusing  He is accusing everyone
 Me you and everyone in the world is guilty  Whether one
 sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with 
 whether we do evil things  We do them regardless  

Hmm it seems that this is the core of Christianity then you 
have to feel guilty and then there's this single personality
that will save you from this universal guilt feeling

Brian I will tell you a secret I don't feel guilty at all
I do mistakes and I regret them however I've never had this
huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder

If things happen wrong I will try to learn from the mistakes
and go on

This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
religious doctrines And if your personality type is 
opposite then you are not that easily attached to a certain
world view system

 So do you see Jesus's point  Christians are not perfect  Nonchristians
 are not perfect  Nonchristians do not want to come into the
 Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives
 and they will not like the sight  It is an ugly thing to see how far
 we have fallen from Jesus's perspective  Do you think you want to
 know how really ignorant you are  Do you think Brian Kendig wants
 to know  Do you think I want to know  Ego verses the truth
 which do you choose

All I know is that I don't know everything And frankly speaking
I don't care life is fun anyway I recognize that I'm not 
perfect but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
and inspiring life

There are humans that subscribe to the same notion The nice
thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden
the shoulders feel far more relaxed

 he so chooses he so chooses and there is nothing I can do beyond that
 to change his mind   For it is his choice   But at this very moment
 Brian hasn't gotten even that far  He is still at the point where he
 does not want to look  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me but his
 head will not turn around to see the entire picture  So far he is
 satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance 


The problem is that you imagine him inside this huge wall unable

have a case where relativity plays a big role concerning looking
at opposite frames of reality

  Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

This is not correct  The event horizon is not the center of the black
hole but merely the distance at which the escape velocity is equal to the
speed of light  That is the event horizon is a finite radius

Is this Zeno's Paradox

No  Zeno's paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite
series of decreasing terms can sum to a finite result

Nothing can get out of a black hole because
the escape velocity is the speed of light I don't know how time dialation
can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event horizon Can any
one explain how matter gets in

Well suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was
sent towards a black hole  As it got closer to the event horizon the
red shift would keep increasing  The period would get longer and longer
but it would never stop  An observer would not observe the probe actually
reaching the event horizon  The detected energy from the probe would keep
decreasing but it wouldn't vanish  Expt never quite reaches zero

I guess the above probably doesn't make things any more clear but hopefully
you will get the general idea maybe

display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight  As for not knocking it's
a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even

I can certainly see opposing the Amen  but that doesn't require

prayers to do with public schooling  I ask this question as a devout
Christian

   Uh oh Michael you typed hell and capitalized it to boot Now
Peter Nyikos will explain that you're not a real Christian

I'll back off when they do

Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here  I guarantee
you the people who want school prayer aren't going to back off when
they can't even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray
silently

Their kids can bloodywell pray any Goddamned time they WANT to  And
nothing on heaven or earth in government or the principal's office
can prevent or in any other way deal with their doing so  Especially
if the prayer is silent as bursting out into the Shema Yisrael or
some other prayer might be construed as disruptive if audible 
No one ever prevented ME from praying in public school  They hardly
even prevented me from masturbating in study hall

soapbox on

If it's ok to pay for legal procedures with gov't money then let's get the 
government to pay for counselling that provides abortion alternatives  
Let's get the government to pay for adoption fees  Let's get the government 
to pay for all the things that make abortion necessary  Why not  They 
are certainly legal procedures

Counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as
biased as counselling that only provides abortion information  How about
providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what she is
comfortable with

Your adoptionfunding idea may be a good one  Any idea if it is feasable


The only way hell is involved is that it is going to be a good skiing resort 
before I give in to paying for abortions  I believe it is wrong and I 
won't pay for it without a gripe  I'm not for making them unlawful I'd 
rather spend money on saving lives than a bunch of investigations and court 
hearings and all this other CRAP we are spending our time on 

You know who's really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff  Lawyers  I 
say let's pass laws to make adoption cheaper easier and infinitely more 
supportive of the birth mother  Let's eradicate the stigma reduce the 
cost pay the price for life

Making adoption easier on the birthmother may help reduce abortion but
it will not eliminate the need for it  Abortion is not done just because
the mother can't care for the child and doesn't feel good about giving it
to strangers  Abortion is done because the mother can not afford the
pregnancy

soapbox off


A person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights
of another person  

Cool enough  You'll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement 
than getting people to agree to it  For example I perceive I have a right 
not to participate in what I feel is murder  I don't think the government 
should either  On the other hand since we are having trouble proving that 
it is murder there is no right to stop someone from doing it if they so 
choose either by legal means or harassment  Of course persuasion is 
allowed but watch that line between persuasive and harassing

The second part is a definition of a person  A simplistic explanation is
that a person is a member of society  Most normal adult human beings are
good examples of people  Most children over two years old are people as
well  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation
with them  It is actually more complicated than that but I have no desire
to spend the time it would take to explain it to you  Read the thread Why
is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification

But why is your definition authoritative enough for the whoe US  Surely
you can understand there are other definitions with equal right of 
consideration

Then please justify why being human automatically makes something valuable
And why that includes the unborn


If the government refused
to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then
it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose
mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby
will also require care for  years

True  That needs to be fixed  It is part of the problem  If Clinton has a 
medical program to get underway let him address this too  It is cheaper 
in the long run to save lives later they will be productive members of 
society  At least if his plan works

No they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society  Even
if they do that is MANY YEARS in the futureuntil which they are a burden
on someone or society  There is also the matter of the mother  Forcing
her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent
her from being a productive member of society

Actually I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not
those who object to federal funding  I admit I did not say it very
clearly and apologize for that


To refuse to fund abortions  is to remove that choice from some
women and add the additional burden to society for no reason

No  This is really flawed logic  It would be like me saying I was born 
with a disfigured face and I want cosmetic repair  It is 
discriminatory that I cannot make that choice and so you must pay for it  

That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or 
otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill sic for that choice

Ok look  It's like this  We are footing the bill  Maybe they will
take choice A  Maybe they will take choice B  Maybe they will take choice
C  They can't afford any one of them  If they take choice A we'd have
to pay them say   If they take choice B it would cost us   If they
take choice C it will cost us  now and a hell of a lot more for the next
 years  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay
for  Now some people happen not to like choice A  Other people happen
not to like choice C paying for it that is  C has been around and paid
for for years  Even though it means we spend a lot of money we can't in
conscience refuse to pay for it  Now A has been around and is perfectly
legal but it hasn't been funded in the past  Now A is going to be funded
but some people object  They don't like the idea of their tax money going
to pay for choice A  So we could refuse to fund A at all  Then those
women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice
B or C which will cost all of us more money  Most of us don't see any
reason at all why more money should be spent to the effect of removing
personal choice from some women  The alternative is to fund A if that is
what the mother chooses  We will also still fund B and even C if that
is what the mother chooses  However some women will certainly choose A
and that will then save us  we otherwise would have had to spend  Your
taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object they are being
lowered because we will fund a choice that is legal despite your
objections to it  Actually your taxes are not really going to go down
as I'm sure you would point out  But the amount that is saved in that
area can help out in anotherlike our massive debt


If you disagree then give us some reasons  Given that abortion is
LEGAL and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the
population 
it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford
them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you
would force upon them  I refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice
from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure

WHAT

I say objection to the procedure is irrelevant  Uncle Bill doesn't pay for 
breast augmentation facelifts etc  Why abortions  It's elective 
surgery  

Those other procedures you mention only cost money  There is no savings
in other procedures that would be required down the road without them
In fact there could be additional costs down the road because of them
This is quite different from the case of abortion

As for your argument you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making 
it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too SO YOU 
ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS  Think about 
it  A poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded what's she 
gonna do  What choice have YOUR PLANS given her  Your kind of double
talk really makes me ill

This is bullshit  We are not refusing to make the alternative affordable
too  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then
your statement would make sense  But that is not the case so it doesn't
If Clinton tried to block funding for prenatal care and delivery or left
it out of his healthcare plan I would certainly object  I would also be
quite surprised


Prochoice  Ha  ProAbortion really fits in your case

Yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reasons you think

If you're gonna fund one choice you have to fund them all at the very 
least

YOU STUPID FUCK  WE DO want to fund all the choices  YOU are the
one who wants to NOT fund all the choices

        IMHO if we fund the adoption choice right meaning not just 
throwing money at it but cutting costs esp legal costs we won't need 
abortion anymore

Your humble opinion is still wrong  Even with easy adoption there is still
the fact that pregnancy takes several months  Months in which a young woman
could need to be getting an education  like finishing High School entering
college finishing college getting a jobthings that are much harder to
do if you have to take a break for a few monthsthings that have a massive
impact on her future productivity


have a right to life  A fetus is not a person  You can not have a
conversation with them  

Ah  Let's kill the mentally incompetant as well  Or how about people we 
just don't like since we can't have a conversation with them

You can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant  And even
though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with people
you just don't like it is still possible for others to have a conversation
with them  It is not possible for anyone to have a conversation with
a fetus

They are not biologically independent  

Nor was my son at the age of  weeks  He was breastfed and would not take
a bottle  Just what does biologically independent mean  I'll be happy to 
punch any definition full of loopholes

He was still biologically independent  At least to the same extent you are
now  He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner  He
breathed his own air  A fetus on the other hand gets it's nutrients already
digested by the mother  It gets its oxygen from the mother as well  That
is not biologically independent

Their
awareness is questionable  

Aha You admit it is questionable  Yet you are willing to kill it even if 
it may be very aware  I suggest you rethink your viewpoint

Awareness is only part of what makes a member of society  It is the
minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something
without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing
of a true member of society  I keep asking but I still haven't seen a real
justification for why the life of a nonsentient creature should be worth the
suffering of a sentient being  I haven't read every response on the threads
I've been asking on yet so we'll see if I see one later

They have no experiences in the real world to make up a personality

This is also true of quite a few Unix programmers  So what  D

Anyone who can program in UNIX has a lot of experiences in the real world

 Let us not limit
 'misctaoism' to 'philosophy'  

But if we don't limit it to something the discussion degenerates into
a big amorphous glob 

Hmmare you a Taoist  Imposing limits does do something usefulit gives
you something to go beyond

It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the
category of general metaphysics I would prefer any misctaoism
to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated
with at least semiorthodox Taoism with established classic works 
definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about 

I tend to be a bit critical of any stratification of Taoism  I especially
tend to frown on any suggestion that orthodoxy or classics have any
special place in Tao

I think neoTaoism should be excluded or get its own group what I
mean by this is HumptyDumpty Taoism in which Taoism means whatever 
a poster says it means This alttaoism could also be a refuge 
for debates about what Taoism REALLY means or speculations on sexual
alchemy etc

So rather than debate what Taoism REALLY means you are suggesting that
we take someone else's word for it and work thusly  I'd rather not thank
you

What's happening is that that the term Taoism is becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic Alchemy 
Zen etc by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they 
want This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled The
Tao of this that and everything else

Whereas you of course have a clear idea of what the word means  Can
you tell the Tao 

Any other commentsideas I look forward to seeing them On balance
I say let misctaoism rip and let the chips fall where they may

Wonderful idea

it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the
Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to
these groups just as they do now

Only if you choose to define failure in that way  Or to define it at all

What an exciting thread finally

Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu
 mentioned first in the Vedas Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence
 worshipped by the Persians Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun he is
 the lord of contract honor and obedience therefore naturally worshipped by
 soldiers He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct
 antly agreed because of His obligationthe blood of that bull spilled and
 grew all earth lifethen Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat

Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians

Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman
 Pantheon tm for some semitricky reason I forget why But all references of
 Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same so apparently His worship
 was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy like membership
 in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc The sociology of religion in
 ancient times is fascinating

Oh His Bday was  Dec Ahem

I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the
 Roman Imperial God Roster or what It contained mostly soldiers with  levels
 of initiation They worshipped underground in caverns in pews The bull horns
 in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits I'm not sure
 that they had Mithraic significance or not

I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the
 Christian masses But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt

Someone mentioned bullfighting Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls I forget More
 likely for a religious source might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed
 by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood Cybele worship extended all
 throughout even up to France bigtime

  This is quite different from saying Employing force on other people
  is immoral period   Unfortunately from time to time we are obliged
  to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
  we have to bear the moral consequences of that
  
  Since both statements to all intents and purposes say effectively
  the same thing 
 
 Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force
 in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is
 not moral say effectively the same thing
 
 Yes when you tag on the Unfortunately  then to all intents and
 purposes you are saying the same thing

Then delete the unfortunately   Now tell me that the two statement
say effectively the same thing

And to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop please notice
that we are only obliged to use force to preserve self   We can choose
not to preserve self which is the point of pacifism

OK got you  I concede your point though the word obliged strongly
implies that one must sometimes use force  A further rephrasing would
give you the distinction you mention however  If I have you right a pacifist
would not even go on to say unfortunatelyetc

 Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and
 the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two 
 statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when
 they say effectively the same thing
 
 What they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator

And in this case they don't prescribe the same things so

Yes fair enough though why confuse things by saying that one is 
somtimes obliged if the real meaning is that one is never obliged

                   and lead one to do precisely the same thing then 
  either both statements are doublespeak or none
 
 They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what
 motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
 same thing
 
 That's not true  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum 
 force and still be a pacifist  If the minimum is  great   but one is
 always trying to get as close to  force as possible under that belief
 Not the same as 'force is immoral period' but still tending to pacifism

If you don't think the use of force is immoral why minimise its use

If you don't think that it is immoral period

burning yourself alive seems a rough way to go given the waco bunch
had other choices

but it reminded me of the russian oldbelievers who thinking the
antichrist was coming in  grew frantic when Peter the Great 
started westernizing Russia and reforming the Russian Church a few
years later They locked themselves in their churches and burned
themselves alive by the thousands 

are there other cases of apocalypseobsessed christians resorting
to selfimolation is there a history of precedents

If almost all people agree that the sun exists in the usual uncritical sense
and almost all people agree that  a deal is bad  it's a reasonable 
conclusion that the sun really does exist and that the deal really is bad
I disagree completely Until rather recently most people did not
believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb Popular
opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact
True but nevertheless the basis of all matters of fact is overwhelming
popular opinion and some overwhelming popular opinion is fact the
sun shines  If it were not so physics would be a personal matter
assumed to be different for each of us  There would be YourGravity and
MyGravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict
both  
This is simply complete nonsense The basis for 'matters of fact' is
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is
The basis Eric is people peering at the world and saying what
they see  I'm talking about uninterpreted facts  observations  People
do those  Agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory
that is more than personal
Yes that's true but you have to be clear exactly what is
an uninterpreted observation It's pretty low level stuff
'The sun shines' is already a LOT higher level than that We
can agree that 'I perceive brightness' perhaps

Now I take an experience of goodevil to be every bit as raw a fact as an
experience of pain or vision
That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says
You're not comparing apples with apples  If we all look at the same meter
we'll agree  If we're all in the same situation that's when we'll
agree on fundamental values if at all  People who say that nobody agrees on
values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem
to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either
Huh What do you mean 'all in the same situation' Let's take me
and Dennis Kriz as examples We're in pretty different situations
but I think we can agree as to whether it's day or night I don't
think we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally
acceptable Yet we are certainly in the same difference of
situations with respect to each other Looks like weaselwords
to me Frank 

I don't see that it's any evidence at all
As I point out above I'm really not interested very much in
what the popular opinion is I'm prepared to trustto some extent
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
because by and large they accord with my own However if everyone
else said the dial read  and it looked like a  to me I would
hope that I would believe myself Ie believing other people about
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
what I would believe if I observed myself but the possibility exists
that it is not Since I know from observation that others disagree
with me about what is good I believe I can discount popular opinion
about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually
Firstly if everyone else said the dial was  and I saw  I'd check
my lens prescription
That's up to you I guess

  Secondly your observation that people
disagree shows nothing  people may be looking at different things
by virtue of being in different situations  If I look at an elephant I'll 
see an elephant  That doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you 
look at an iguana
This 'different situations' stuff is pretty confusing Frank How
do we decide if we are in the same situation You mind explaining

    Thirdly I question your assumption that when
people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals that 
they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals that seems to be the 
disagreement you refer to
Huh I don't think so I think that people disagree about
fundamental goals

I just started reading this newsgroup and haven't been following the
thread I'm just curious  How did this thread get started with
Albert Sabin and changed into something else  What was it about
Sabin that initiated a religious discussion

Colin

Its just variation within a thread  The variation at times has been so great
that speciation has occurred  So Albert Sabin is the common ancestor of
several threads some of which have themselves speciated  On a separate topic
I subscribed to to just recently  Albert Sabin existed at that time so I
have no clue as to its origins  Maybe the abiogenesists have an answer  I
might also point out that evolution is aimless  Thus why Albert 
Sabin evolved into a religious discussion is probably unexplainable

  For your information I checked the Library of Congress catalog
and they list the following books by Francis Hitching

I believe I've just discovered an anthopological parallel  In my many
discussions with the fundies their main tactic is to discredit
my sources  They shrilly bleat


Possibly the parallel just stems from your tending to use bad sources
Anyway don't you think that similarity is rather shallow  You're only
looking at the surface at the way of argumentation  
And now you should perhaps go a little deeper and try to find the difference
for example find out whether you can find real science done by Hitching
If you can't will you then admit that your attempt at quoting an authority
has backfired

I've seen referrences to Creation vs Evolution several times in aa
and I have question Is either point of view derived from direct
observation can either be scientific I wonder if the whole
controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the Truth
rather than the truth itself 
Both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome and I can't help
wondering which came first As I've pointed out elsewhere my view of
human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing
anyhthing objectively  all knowledge is inherently subjective So in
the context of aa would you take a stand based on what you actually
know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell
the difference

trajancwisunomahaedu Stephen McIntyre writes
 Can a theist be truly objective  Can he be impartial
      when questioning the truth of his scriptures or
      will he assume the superstition of his parents
      when questioning 

I think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that
God definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that
the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a
theist 

 It usually all has to do with how the child is
      brought up  From the time he is born the
      theist is brought up with the notion of the
      truth of some kind of scripture the Bible
      the Torah the Qur'an  etc  He is told
      of this wondrous God who wrote or inspired
      the scripture of the prophets talked about in
      the scripture of the miracles performed  etc
      He is also told that to question this as
      children are apt to do is a sin a crime
      against God and to lose belief in the scrip
      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell
      Thus by the time he is able to read the
      scripture for himself the belief in its truth
      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
      matter of course

You're missing something here  There are people who convert from
nontheism to theism after being brought up in a nontheist household  I
don't have any statistics as to how many though  That would be an
interesting thing to know  I think that religion is a crutch  People are
naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable  People don't want
to believe that when they die they are dead finished  That there is
nothing else after that  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy
Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe things
science has not yet described and it also gives people a feeling of
security that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok
That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions  This
has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these
people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their
belief system for what it gains them  This is why I think it's kind of
useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism  They are happy with
their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too
they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept
the harsh reality that they are running from

Anyway I'm getting kind of carried away here  But my point is that theism
doesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow
up as a theist although this happens far too often  Theism is designed
to have its own attractions

 
                      Atheist
                            Libertarian
                    Proindividuality
                                Proresponsibility
                  Jr     and all that jazz

Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus  I realize it is normally tossed
out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons

 It is not tossed out as a source but would it be regarded as
unbiased and independant 

This brings up another something I have never understood  I asked this once
before and got a few interesting responses but somehow didn't seem satisfied
Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source  This might be a 
literaryhistorical question but when I studied history I always looked for 
firsthand original sources to write my papers  If the topic was on Mr X I 
looked to see if Mr X wrote anything about it  If the topic was on a group 
look for the group etc  If the topic is on Mr X and Mr X did not write 
anything about it barring the theistic response about the Bible being 
divinely inspired which I can't adequately argue wouldn't we look for people
who ate worked walked talked etc with him  If someone was at an event 
wouldn't they be a better reporter than someone who heard about it second 
hand  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand  I know there is bias
and winners writing history but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best
still apply

Response

Is there some relation between the name 'Cybele' and the phenemenon of the
'sibyl'  Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be

My understanding is that Islam was founded on the remains of a goddess
cult or two  Many Muslims would not like to hear that 


You

It gets more interesting Romans called her Great Mother Magna Mater
could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black
prob IS connected to that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca rd cent AD She was
supreme Goddess in Lyons France    Attis was castrated and formed into
a pine tree    she should be worshiped on  Mar    in Rome it was
an ecstatic cult her priests wore drag worked themselves up in dance and
castrated themselves in order to initiate to her lived their lives as women
They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit

Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India where
else where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe I
forget by nowthere's a book on that

Of course that excepts that weird Russian  Romanian th cent Xian cult
that did all kinds of selfcastration too I forget their name


Response

I'd love to get details or references on any of the above  My own exploration
of this issue has only extended to a brief examination of the Zuni 'berdache'
The Zuni ManWoman by Will Roscoe University of New Mexico Press 
probably has some interesting things to say about them  I've yet to
procure it

Any details or references on

Ecstatic cults in Rome India RussiaRomania Christian too which
exhibit any type of transsexualism or transvestitism male OR female
though I expect mostly the former will be found

Actually if Mr X had something to gain by his claims his
account of the events would nmot be the most respected Case
and point the resurrection By claiming that the resurrection
actually happened the early preachers were able to convert many
to Christianity However if you read Mathew   and the
case for the resurrected saints who walked around Jerusalem and
appeared to many People you would realize that other
historians Josephus for one would have reported on it all if
it happened The fact that the Bible speaks of events of such
great magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with
the fact that they are not reported on by historians could only
mean that the bible contains many made up stories

  Hmm it seems that this is the core of Christianity then you 
  have to feel guilty    
 
 I think I see where you are coming from Kent  Jesus doesn't view
 guilt like our modern venacular colors it   
 
 Feelings have nothing to do with guilt  Feelings arise from the state of 
 being guilty  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive  Feelings are a 
 reaction from guilt  Jesus is talking about the guilt state not the 
 reaction   Let me give you an example
 
 Have you ever made a mistake  Have you ever lied to someone  Even a
 little white lie   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really 
 didn't know  Have you ever hated someone  Have you ever been selfish
 Are you guilty of any one of these   The answer is of course YES  You
 are guilty  Period  That is it what Jesus is getting at  No big surprise  
 Feelings do not even enter the picture   Consider Jesus's use of the word
 guilt as how a court uses it

I've done all those things and I've regretted it and I learned 
a lesson or two So far an aspirin a good talk with your wife
or a one week vacation has cured me  no need for group therapy
or strange religions

Brian does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient

 About the only way top get out of this one is to claim that a newborn is a

This all would also implicate that in order for the sinning  month

Russell Turpin as is his wont has raised some interesting issues 
in his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians 
Unfortunately he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is 
not available The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable 
result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such 
as humanity 

Also unfortunately perhaps I have a deadline in two weeks the 
responsibility for which prevents me in good conscience 
from writing a more considered response and fully entering the
fray as it were 

Let me then say what I can briefly



The two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are
so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning  

This point for the netbrowsers who also still read books is
pursued throughly in Kaufmann CritiqueofReligionandPhilosophy

The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed
in part as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if
he has ultimate responsibility 

This is a theological statement worthy of Barth
Dr Turpin DD may wear the black robe of Geneva yet 

Indeed many traditions present
an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret
loving one's neighbor as following various other rules and
relying on their god to make things come out right precisely
because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate
responsibility Once again we are confronted with good sounding
goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean 

This requires the assumption that all interpretations are
equally valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing
among them I wouldn't make that assumption I don't think it is
a reasonable assumption 

And who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  There
are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward
reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way

Michael and I and others read 'the Bible' with Christian
glasses Among the things that this should imply is that the
NT informs the OT even to the point of dominanting it Some
points in the OT ceremonial  dietary laws are explicitly 
abrogated by the NT texts To drive Russell Turpin's point with
adequacy one needs to begin with NT texts probably from Matthew
and probably about damnation Just trying to help  

This part is I discover what most moves me to post

mls I am a radical Christian only in that I take the gospel seriously

No Michael the conservative Christians also take the gospel 
seriously  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the
gospel

Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced not to say inappropriate
Michael's selfdescription much govern  The equation of radical  liberal 
which seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong  Radical conservatives are 
possible if sadly lacking in numbers at present Thomas Merton
was a radical even though conservative in some ways St Francis
was a radical similarly How many examples are needed

mls  Why don't I and the myriads of other Christians like me
mls tell you something about Christianity 

Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter Klingons have
two hearts so my metaphor is not mixed just extraterrestrial  
Russell Turpin in an earlier post had said that Michael Michael's
theological positions actually didn't tell him much about Christianity
Dean Simeon responds this time gently 'What do you mean' More
direct perhaps would have been 'What could you possibly mean'
The implied rhetorical effort to separate Michael from the 
tradition is a failure Michael is in the tradition If your idea
of the tradition doesn't include him Change your idea of the tradition

The irony here is that there is nothing in Christianity per
se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and
gays  

How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue
I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence from Michael
on this issue yet 'nothing' is a hideous overstatement

One verse is enough to refute it I'll offer two from
Paul of all people

'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female'Galatians 
I don't quote single verses as a rule and I don't carry 
them in my head and 'Nothing shall separate us from the glory of God' 
roughly from Romans If Russell would promise to convert based
on these or any other verses  I'd promise to get the full context
for any that he requires  

In short it is the extraChristian principles that
make Michael's Christianity beneficial and I suspect they would
be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by
Christian interpretation  

This conclusion does not follow even in short from the
argument that goes before A surprising logical ellipsis

 Question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists Stephen
 Tice the Cotera Joe Gaut et alapologies if I've mislabelled any
 of you I've only started reading trm since the BD disaster  But I
 know the Cotera is a fundy and are defending Koresh and his beliefs
 as an example of True Christianity under persecution from the the Big
 Bad Secular State what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits
 If the reports are accurate what IYO does this say about the quality of
 his Christianity  Or are the allegations just part of the Big
 CoverUp

Thank you Steve  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
a Christian  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
conviction  I am not certain what you mean by the fundy part as the
term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses  If you refer to
those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and
wish to follow in his way then I plead guilty  But what does it
matter what I think  The Roman circus is over  The lions have been
satisfied  for now  The Emperor after the long and gruelling
struggle sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down

With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh I urge you
to reexamine my previous posts  I believe you mistakenly assume
that defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his
right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'
theology  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch
Davidian teachings and regret so many are hungup on that aspect
of the tragic events of the past few days

Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the
federal government  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting
infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not
fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government they are
state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the
local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having
ever been levied against him  Under American law he was innocent
as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty  At least
that's how it is suppposed to be  But he was demonized and propa
gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a
lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might
bring upon him  

But evidence trickles in that the twentyone children who left the
building in the early days of the siege  were carefully examined
by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse
and none was found  DeGuerin one of the attorneys who met with
Davidians several times before the conflagration reported that
the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse

Ultimately Steve what I think about the heart of David Koresh
is quite unimportant  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a
most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all
So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One
who has all knowledge  Meanwhile let's clean up the mess left
on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong
message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the
people it serves

Joe Gaut

 
 I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire I wouldn't
 put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself  On the other
 hand if the propanetankaccident story is correct I wouldn't put it
 past the FBI to try to cover its ass by claiming Koresh did it  I
 hope your government does a VERY thorough investigation of the whole
 debacle and I'll be disappointed if a few heads don't roll  The
 authorities seem to have botched the original raid and in the matter
 of the fire are guilty of either serious misjudgement or reckless
 endangerment

 c One of them is wrong but we never have any information as to who so

For those who think David Koresh didn't have a solid structure

 I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
 sermon  It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most people

I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths

Only my common sense  The fire was caused by either Koresh and his
followers or by the FBIATFCIAKGBand maybe the Harper Valley PTA  Since
you are throwing around the evidence arguement I'll throw it back  Can
you prove any government agency did it  Please don't resort to they 
covered it up so that proves they did it or any wild theories about how
the government agencies intentionally started the fire  The key words
are proof and evidence
proves they did it


 All that thou shalt not kill stuff

I'd like to point out that the Bible says Do not commit murder The NKJ
translation mistranslates  Selfdefense was never considered murder  The

Please explain how Koresh was defending himself from those children who
burned

 I recall reading in Michael  Rutherford's novel Sarum a scene in
 which the son of a Roman nobleman living in Britain takes part in a
 secret ceremony involving a bull  He stands naked in a pit covered
 with some sort of scaffolding while assistants coax a bull to stand on
 the scaffolding  They then fatally stab the bull which douses the
 worshipper in the pit with blood  This is supposedly some sort of
 rite of passage for members of the bull cult  I wonder if this is
 related to the Mithras cult
 
 I don't know where Rutherford got his information for this chapter
 The book is historical fiction and most of the general events which
 take place are largely based on historical accounts
 
 There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbell's
 OccidentalMythology  He also described levels of initiation I think
   I don't know where Campbell got his info but I remember thinking he
 was being a little eclectic
 
 I also wonder what if any connection there is between the ancient bull
 cults and the current practice of bullfighting popular in some
 Mediterranean cultures
 
 Quite a bit  If you haven't read Campbell give him a try

Not to worry  The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost 
every major Xian church there is  For centuries now  And still they 
stand  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists I am sure
They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the 
Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of 
Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison  One thing is 
known  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons  And the 
Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the 
Boobtist Witchhunt
  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with 
their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals they may now start in on 
their MasonBoobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and 
more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a 
handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop

 ramming modified tanks into the walls of a building and injecting
 toxic gases into the building are just routine procedures no WAY
 anything could go wrong

My core point was and still is that  children died and Mr
Koresh could just have opened the door and asked the children to
go out before all this happened You might blaim FBI ATF
President Clinton Satan Pepsi Coke or anything else but
you can't avoid the fact that one single action would have 
saved small children from a dreadful and painful death

 Well Mr Koresh allowed other children and adults to leave the compound
during the course of the siege why didnt these children leave then
I dont know myself and certainly havent heard any answers on this here

 Yes one simple nonaction ie NOT attacking the compound with
modified tanks would have prevented this tragedy I bet you blamed
the MOVE people for the deaths that occurred in adjacent row

So it's sometimes correct to say that morality is objective or what
After all I could hardly be wrong without dragging in the oword
For your part when you say that relativism is true that's just
your opinion  Why do folk get so heated then if a belief in relativism
is merely a matter of taste  to be fair you have been very calm
I get the impression that's because you don't care about notions of

Dear netters

I am wondering about the accident of Koresh I have heard different 
explanations
Without any explanation about your opinions and believes
 please kindly tell me

      What was Koresh talking about Or  what was his message
      What was the main reason that Government went in war with
             Koresh
Some say that due to Tax payment 

Thanks in advance for your historical explanation

Your discusion on the reality of atoms is interesting but it
would seem that you are verging on the question Is anything real
that is since observation is not  reliable how can we say
that anything is real  I don't think this was the intention
of the original question since you now defineout the word
real so that nothing can meet its criteria
Just a thought

Brian 

PS  Rainbows and Shadows are real they are not objects they
are phenomenon  An interesting question would be if atoms
are objects classical or phenomenon neoquantum or what

Recently I've asked myself a rather interesting question What RIGHT does
god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of course 

In his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
according to his rules we will burn in hell Well with what RIGHT can god
make that desicion Let's say for the sake of argument that god creates every
one of us directly or indirectly it doesn't matter What then happens is
that he first creates us and then turns us lose Well I didn't ask to be
created 

Let's make an analogue If a scientist creates a unique living creature which
has happened it was even patented does he then have the right to
expect it to behave in a certain matter or die

Who is god to impose its rules on us  Who can tell if god is REALLY so
righteous as god likes us to believe Are all christians a flock of sheep
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest 

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm

I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm I mean it

Tony Alicia writes

Let's start with the name Rosicrucian I took me a long time to come
to the conclusion that there is a difference between a member of a
rosicrucian body and BEING a ROSICRUCIAN So when you say that you met
some 'rosicrucians' you mean members of a group that calls themselves
rosicrucian At least that is what your observation suggests 


Response

This makes much sense to me  This is also true of most religions
There is a difference between being a member of a group of people
who call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually
BEING any of these  The social groups tend to make very important
requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'  I find that
the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be
interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that
'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial
Philosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads 


Tony

I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium
Rosicrucianum only because they may be confused by some readers of this
newsgroup with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based the USA Jurisdiction in
San Jose CA this being the RC org with the most members last time I
looked Of course most members does not necessarily mean best


Response

Certainly true  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves
'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC  Sure I've heard all the
hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these
Western esoteric groups but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'
I'll admit my bias  I live in San Jose 


Tony

You'll have to trust me when I tell you that if that
lectureclasswhatever had been presented by AMORC it is unlikely that you
would have had the same impression ie you'd probably have had a
positive impression more likely than a negative one IMHO 


Response

This may be slightly off  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have
a couple friends in AMORC  The stories I've heard and the slight contact
I've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with
any kind of warm welcome  I still like to think that most people who
are involved with stratified relationships monogamy religion etc
are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'


Tony

     
It is curious to know that  other RC 'orders' in the USA claim to be non
sectarian


Response

I'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call 
themselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'
Is this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons who require that a member 'believe
in God by hisher definition'

     
     
Tony

I don't see nothing fundamentally wrong with us containing
something divine And yes I don't like phrases like eternal bliss
either 


Response

Let alone us BEING something divine

Weiss says

     Orthodox is a compound word It comes from 'orthos' straight true
     right and from 'doxa' opinion doctrine teaching I use orthodox to
     refer to 'right teaching' Right teaching is derived from letting God
     speak to us through the Bible This can be from reading simple truths
     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible

  Thanks for the etymology lesson but I actually know what orthodox means
You're avoiding my question however which was From what body of theology
does your version of orthodoxy come  You seem to simply be saying that
whatever you understand the Bible to say is orthodox

ra Who is that holds that Luke meant what you said he meant

     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are
     pertinent

  You are obviously mistaken since many many people have read the Bible and
many do not agree with you on this point  Once again Robert is your
interpretation the only correct or orthodox one

ra Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is
ra challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to
ra look at the Bible in order to see the truth but what of those who
ra see Biblical things differently from you


     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one
     views the Bible is somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff
     that I glean from it Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can
     have a discussion on that topic But to decry something that I put
     forward without putting forward something else to discuss and to
     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious

   This whole string began as a response to your attacks on Mormonism no one
is attacking your personal beliefs only your tendency to present them as
orthodoxy  I don't much care what you believe about the Bible just don't
present you personal understanding as the only orthodox one


ra Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
ra understands it

     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is
     wrong then please show me from Scripture where it is wrong  Simply
     stating that there are other views is not a proof Show it to me from
     Scripture and then we can go on

   I have never attacked your specific beliefs  that's your approach
remember
    Stating that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other views
is indeed proof that the Bible can be interpreted many ways which has been
my whole point all along  The specifics of your belief are your business
just don't pretend that they are anything more than your personal
intepretation and be careful about crying heresy based on your private
belief system

  Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
  How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference
 
 Which goes faster a bullet or a snail  How come you can answer that when
 Einstein proved that there isn't an objective frame of reference
 
 Not that Einstein proved anything

Oh yes he did  You may not agree with his premises and what he proved may
not apply to reality if such a thing exists but he certainly proved
something

                                        but you can't answer it and your 
 answer be in general true

Got it in one  Similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral system
to be better than another in every possible circumstance  This does not
however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another
in a specific set of circumstances  Nor does it preclude a set of moral
relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of
circumstances which they all agree they are in

                             And even that statement assumes an
 objective reality independent of our beliefs about it

Eh  Could you explain this  Which that statement are you talking about

  And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
  it isn't an objective reality for values
 
 I'm sorry I can't parse an objective reality for values  Could you try
 again
 
 san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face
 of disagreement

I still don't quite see what you're trying to say  I assume by values you
mean moral values yes  In which case what do you mean by real  What is
a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one

 If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in
 your opinion then all you get is infinite regress

Sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  It looks extremely finite
to me

                                                    What you do not get
 is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
 is inferior to that of the man of peace

Sorry but that's not so  I can provide a justification for asserting that
the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace  I
just can't provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances

Similarly I can provide a justification for asserting that bullets move
faster than snails  That justification won't hold in all possible frames of
reference but it will hold in almost all the frames of reference I am ever
likely to be in

                                      Your saying it does not
 make it so  and that's according to your premise not mine

I don't think I agree with this  My saying it does make it so from my
point of view and according to my premises unless the argument is invalid
It may indeed not make it so from your point of view but I never claimed
that it did  In fact I don't even claim that you exist enough to have a
point of view

 So Rick why not read the Bible for yourself  It is written in plain
 english  Decide for yourself   

I'm curious to know if Christians ever read books based on critique
on the religion classical text such as Age of Reason by Paine
or The Myth Maker by Jacobi Sometimes it is good to know your
enemy and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
both sides and not solely the one and only right one

 Kent with regards to the information contained in the Bible which
 is the original context of this thread Brian Kendig is inside a huge
 wall  Brian IS inside  The Bible and the information contained therein
 are outside the wall   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the
 absurd things he says  For example If I get through into the firey
 pit I will cease to exist  The Bible doesn't say that  He hasn't
 a clue even to what Jesus said about hell  That is but one example

Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate
from your own reference frame There's no inside and no outside
there are just two polarized views As for statements inside the
Bible things are still not that clear we don't have any indications
for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament one of the 
few books that actually talks about Satan Jobs is very much out
of line with the rest of the OT books and there's a chance that
someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures

 Now in your sense Kent of sensing realitythat is a different
 matter  And to you and to Brian relativity does play a big role
 What we perceive to be true depends on our vantage point  Since I
 have read the Bible and Brian Kendig shows that he hasn't he has 
 a narrower perspective than mine  at least in the respect
 of knowledge of the Bible   I am proposing to Brian Brian come up here
 and take a look from this vantage point   But Brian replies I rather
 not thank you  I am content where I am  Besides the vista from up
 there stinks   And in the meanwhile Brian ignores the facts that
 he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same
 plateau where Brian now stands

This operates the other way around as well You have to understand
the mind of an atheist agnostic or as in my case a radical
relativist If you don't understand the underlying concepts it is 
pretty hard to continue with a dialogue I'm not a perfect Christian
however about  years of Christian teaching should have provided
me with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame

 Surely you are not equating David Koresh with Christianity The two are

This is always an option when the sect is causing harm relabel
the cult to something else

  after a painful death
  
 
 If the children are not being fed whose fault is that  You and I
 have plenty of food on our tables while others starve  Why is that
 God gave us this earth to manage  I don't think we're doing a very
 good job of it  The only consolation I have for those suffering
 children is that they will be received into the kingdom of Heaven
 where they will never thirst and never hunger again

I agree with your points and I'm glad to hear that you subscribe
to the notion of secular humanism humans helping humans instead
of hoping for a possible deux ex machina solution

As for faith you could always use such constructs to dampen

 If a Christian means someone who believes in the divinity of Jesus it is safe
 to say that Jesus was a Christian

I would label him rather an original Christian not a Pauline Christian
though Sad that the original church lost the game

Capser before you deceive everone into thinking that the latterday
saints have undergone undue persecution through the years for just
believing in their religion perhaps you would like to tell us all what
happened in the Mountain Meadow Massacres and all the killings that were
done under the Blood Atonement Doctrine at the command of Brigham Young

Why don't you tell us Tony  I'm sure what you THINK you know adds up to a
lot more than what Casper has

Doesn't it frustrate you to consider how many intelligent thoughtful 
people you have prepared for the Mormon missionaries with your rant  The
more you talk the better we look  Nothing makes the truth look better
than a background of falsehood

Sic 'em Tony

Someone in the government actually believed Koresh knew the seven
seals of the apocalypse and ordered the invasion so that they'd all
be dead and unable to talk about them in public

Everything we need to know about the seven seals is already
in the bible  There is no knowledge of the seals that
Koresh could have

Unless the FBI were to kill all publishers of the bible it
would seem the story of the seven seals would be bound to
leak out

Assuming for the moment that the FBI believed in the bible and 
were afraid of the seven seals then they would also know
that God is the one who has to open the seals not some
little prophet like Koresh

article about noknock searches arrests


Hmm  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn clearly
marked as officers and yelling Police repeatedly  This is used every
day to bust drug houses  The idea is to awe the suspects into
submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a
gun fight  As for not knocking it's a sad necessity in many cases
since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight  Usually this
strategy works if it didn't then it wouldn't be used so commonly now
would it

In general noknock raids are to preserve evidence like drugs
which can be flushed down the toilet  They are not the standard way
to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber  If there is no need to
search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and
order the suspect to come out with her hands up  If the suspect does
not come out tear gas will be used


comment on the BD omitted


I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day
Furthermore we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of
apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects  Do you suggest

It is not a method to apprehend criminals

that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any
suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers's badges
Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous
and armed suspects How far can they reasonably go to identity
themselves What do you suggest they can do which can't be faked by the
competition

It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be
destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way  It is the most
dangerous way to arrest anyone  The cops are charging into a room
and they don't know what is in it  It is much safer to surround the
place and announce yourself


Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops that's
not an excuse to murder police  In the case of the BD's there was
almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who
would pretend to be cops

Cops are not cops until they identify themselves as police officers


Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the
likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works  If they
are arrested they call their lawyer post bail and hope for a plea
bargain  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will
be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid  Drug
dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other
criminals not to shoot cops  Cops are shot on noknock drug raids
because the criminals aren't aware that they are cops

Noknock raids on homes occupied by noncriminals are more likely to
end in disaster  Mom and Pop citizen KNOW that they have not
committed any crime they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house
cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong  If they have
the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the
housebreakers are criminals not cops  Cops and homeowners may die

The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to
search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal
weapons were found  In this case the noknock warrant was not called
for  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet  The ATF could
have surrounded the compound  A marked police car could have driven
up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and
served the warrant usual way  It this had happened and and Koresh
refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of
the tpg folks would have kept quiet

 Well Stephen's annotated study of David Koresh's sermon
 doesn't bother me  It's probable that a careful review of
 what Stephen has done with obvious expenditure of thoughtful
 effort would provide additional insight into David and his love
 for God May his soul rest in peace   And whether or
 not we agree with various points of theology therein a review
 would likely provide significant insight into our own love
 for God  One thing that seems apparent from even a cursory
 reading of Koresh's message is that he was not the 'looney
 tunes' portrayed in the FBI filtered press reports on him
 but was quite possibly the friendly likeable person his
 attorney reported him to be

Someone stated that the Davidian cult should not be associated
with Christianity Well I read all those four postings and I'm
now even more convinced that Davididians are truly Christian
in nature But sometimes it makes sense to relabel the cult 
especially if the ugliness is too much to handle

  Robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying things
like it is held that cf Kermit thread  On what exact body of
theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox  Who is that holds
that Luke meant what you said he meant  Whenever your personal interpretation
of Biblical passages is challenged your only response seems
to be that one needs merely to look at the Bible in order to see the truth
but what of those who see Biblical things differently from you  Are we to
simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it

Rick I think we can safely say  Robert is not the only person
who understands the Bible and  the leadership of the LDS church
historicly never has  Let's consider some personal interpretations
and see how much trust we should put in Orthodox Mormonism which
could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity

        In one of his attacks on Christians the Mormon Apostle Bruce R
McConkie said they thrash around indarkness in trying to identify
Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised
Messiah He also said Christians are wrong to believe that Jehovah is
the Supreme Deity God the Father and that Christ came into
mortality as His Only Begotten Son McConkie then stated what Mormons
believe today to be the truth about the matter He said that Elohim is
the Father and Jehovah is the Son

  Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists
  have gone in defining their threeinone God it comes as no surprise
  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to
  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the
  promised Messiah Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the
  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten As
  with their concept that God is a Spirit this misinformation about the
  Gods of Heaven is untrue The fact is and it too is attested by Holy
  Writ that Elohim is the Father and that Jehovah is the Son who was
  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ the promised Messiah
  Promised Messiah p 

        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about
their threeinone God and their belief that God is a Spirit as they
are in their understanding of who Elohim and Jehovah are Before
examining McConkie's attack and its validity we shall read a few more
statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words
Elohim and Jehovah McConkie stated

  the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in
  the Old Testament as that ancient work is now published is the
  exalted nametitle Jehovah Promised Messiah p 

  Elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted
  nametitle of God the Eternal Father a usage that connotes his
  supremacy and omnipotence he being God above all Gods Mormon
  Doctrine p 

        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who Elohim and
Jehovah are the Apostle James E Talmage stated

  Elohim as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus
  Christ is the nametitle of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn
  Son in the spirit is Jehovah  the Only Begotten in the flesh
  Jesus Christ Jesus the Christ p 

        A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve
apostles of the Mormon Church states that God the Eternal Fatheris
designated by the exalted nametitle 'Elohim' Articles of Faith
p  Christ in His preexistent antemortal or unembodied
statewas known as Jehovah Articles of Faith p 

        Today Mormon leaders teach that Elohim in the OT refers to God
the Father and Jehovah refers to Christ McConkie attacked Christians
for saying Jehovah can refer to the Father He stressed that these two
nametitles should not be changed around so that Christ is called
Elohim and the Father is called Jehovah the Fatheris Elohim
not Jehovah Jehovah is Christ and Christ is Jehovah they are one
and the same person Promised Messiah p 

        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible the Hebrew word Elohim is
used to refer to the true God false gods and goddesses and the judges
of Israel When referring to the true God Elohim is translated with a
capital G When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges
of Israel it is translated with a small g It is translated four
times as judges Exod   once as judge  Sam 
twice as mighty Gen  Exod  once as angels Ps 
once as godly Mal  once as great Gen  and once as
very great  Sam 

        The word Jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the
tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word
Adonai  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the
tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh However since Jehovah rather
than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism this section will also use
Jehovah instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of
Mormon leaders regarding that name Jehovah unlike Elohim is never
used of false gods It is the personal name of the triune God of the
Bible In the KJV Jehovah is rendered primarily LORD sometimes
GOD and rarely Lord

        Now that we understand something about the words Elohim and
Jehovah and their use by Mormon leaders we shall consider the Apostle
McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is Jehovah
In trying to prove that Jehovah refers exclusively to Christ McConkie
cited several verses from the Bible Some of these verses and McConkie's
interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right
Remember McConkie said the Father is not Jehovah He is only
Elohim The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's
interpretation of Ps  Of this verse he stated

  Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit
  and he testified The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou at my right
  hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool Ps  Two
  Lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater
  than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of
  the other Who are they and what message is contained in this
  Messianic prophecy
  What think ye of Christ our Lord asked certain of his detractors
  toward the end of his mortal ministry Whose son is he Is Christ
  the Son of God or of someone else Is he to be born of a divine Parent
  or will he be as other men  a mortal son of a mortal father That he
  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the
  Jews And so they answered The Son of David
  David's son Truly he was But he was more much more And so our
  Lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture
  asked How then doth David in spirit call him Lord saying The Lord
  said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine
  enemies thy footstool If David then call him Lord how is he his
  son That is if he is only the Son of David how is it that the
  great King acting under inspiration calls him Lord and worships him
  as such And we might add Who is the other Lord the one who spake
  unto David's Lord Can there be any question as to how Jesus is
  interpreting the words of the Psalm He is saying that it means 'The
  Father said unto the Son Elohim said unto Jehovah sit thou on my
  right hand until after your mortal ministry then I will raise you up
  to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to
  sit on my right hand forever' Promised Messiah pp 
  emphasis added

        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie the following
remark in the Mormon pamphlet What the Mormons Think of Christ p 
reads The Lord Elohim the Father said unto my Lord Jehovah the
Son brackets in original

        McConkie clearly stated that it is Elohim the Father who is
speaking to Jehovah the Son in this Psalm However when one looks at
the Hebrew word translated LORD it becomes apparent that either the
first LORD is not the Father or else the Father is Jehovah Either
way McConkie is wrong The Psalm reads

  The LORD Jehovah said unto my Lord Adon Sit thou at my right
  hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool Ps 

        The first LORD in this verse is Jehovah who Mormonism says
is Christ not the Father The second Lord is the Hebrew word Adon
singular for Adonai meaning master or lord If the first LORD is
the Father and the second Lord is the Son then the Father is
Jehovah and the Son is Adon However if the Father is not Jehovah
as McConkie claimed then the first LORD is Jehovah the Son but
who then is Adon Obviously the Father is Jehovah in this Psalm
and His Son is Adon

        Another example involves Isa  about which McConkie stated
the following

  I the Lord have called thee in righteousness Isaiah quoted the
  Father as saying of Christ and will hold thine hand and will keep
  thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the
  Gentiles Isa  Promised Messiah p  emphasis added

        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage
which reads

  I the LORD Jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold
  thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the
  people for a light of the Gentiles Isa 

        According to McConkie I the LORD refers to the Father and
thine and thee refer to Christ However the LORD who is speaking
is Jehovah which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking
or else the Father is Jehovah

        Another example involves Ps  Of these verses McConkie
stated

  The same Psalm says All they that see me laugh me to scorn they
  shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the Lord
  that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in
  him Ps  The fulfillment as Jesus hung on the cross is
  found in these words The chief priests mocking him with the scribes
  and elders said He saved others himself he cannot save If he be
  the King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will
  believe him He trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will
  have him for he said I am the Son of God The thieves also which
  were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth Matt
   Promised Messiah pp  emphasis added

        Ps  reads as follows

  All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they
  shake the head saying He trusted on the LORD Jehovah that he would
  deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him

        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment as Jesus hung
on the cross That means the person who was scorned in these verses was
Christ Who then was the LORD in whom he trusted It was Jehovah
the Father

        Another example involves Ps  and Ps  Regarding them
McConkie stated the following

  With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our
  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was They took counsel
  together against me they devised to take away my life Ps 
  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies the Psalmist says
  Mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my
  bread hath lifted up his heel against me Ps  Promised
  Messiah p 

        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's arrest and
judicial trials We shall first consider Ps  and then Ps  While
McConkie only quoted verse  of Ps  verse  will also be included
to give a complete understanding of the matter

  For I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while
  they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my
  life But I trusted in thee O LORD Jehovah I said Thou art my God
  Elohim Ps 

        McConkie said verse  referred to Jesus Christ Verse  goes
on to tell that He Christ trusted in the LORD who is called His
God or Elohim Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is
Elohim the Father Verse  however reveals that the Elohim of the
man Jesus is Jehovah the Father

        In Ps  McConkie only quoted one verse however two verses
will be considered in this examination

  Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my
  bread hath lifted up his heel against me
  But thou O LORD Jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that
  I may requite them Ps 

        McConkie stated above that verse  referred to Judas' role in
Christ's death Since it was Judas who was the familiar friend who
lifted up his heel the pronouns mine I my and me in verse
 must refer to Christ Notice that at the beginning of verse  there
is a change of pronoun to thou which refers to the LORD Jehovah
Then the pronouns me and I which refer to Christ are used again
That means Christ was speaking to Jehovah the Father in these verses

        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps
        

  One of the great Messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of David
  says The Lord hath sworn and will not repent Thou art a priest for
  ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps  Promised Messiah
  p 

        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ
The question is What in this verse refers to Christ

  The LORD Jehovah hath sworn and will not repent Thou art a priest
  for ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps 

        Does the LORD which is Jehovah refer to Christ If
McConkie is right and Jesus is Jehovah but the Father is not then
the LORD would have to refer to Christ But who then is the one
addressed as the priest forever after the order of Melchizedek The
Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ Heb 
  therefore the LORD Jehovah in Ps  is the Father

        Another example involves Isa  Of these verses McConkie
stated

  Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah Isaiah said
     The Lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all
     It pleased the Lord to bruise him Promised Messiah p 
     emphasis added

        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning
sacrifice of the future Messiah However what he failed to mention is
that they also prove that the Father is Jehovah Verse  reads All
we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way
and the LORD Jehovah hath laid on him Christ the iniquity of us
all and verse  reads Yet it pleased the LORD Jehovah to bruise
him Christ

        Obviously the LORD who laid on Christ the iniquity of us all
and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called Jehovah in these
verses

        Remember McConkie stated that some sectarians even believe
that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity and that Christ came into
mortality as His Only Begotten Son He called this concept
misinformation that is untrue To prove that it is McConkie who is
misinformed and believing untruth two Scriptural references  Sam
 Ps  will be examined McConkie stated the following regarding
these Scriptures

  In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic the Lord says of
  the Seed of David I will be his father and he shall be my son 
  Sam  In the second Psalm the whole of which is also clearly
  Messianic occurs this statement Thou art my Son this day have I
  begotten thee Ps  Paul quotes both of these statements in
  Hebrews  and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the
  Son of God Promised Messiah p 

        McConkie cited Heb  to show that  Sam  and Ps 
refer to Christ who would come as the Son of God Since McConkie first
referenced  Sam  this examination will too However along with
verse  verses  will also be included

  And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
  Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies Also the
  LORD Jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house
  And when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers
  I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy
  bowels and I will establish his kingdom
  He shall build an house for my name and I will stablish the throne of
  his kingdom for ever I will be his father and he shall be my son 
  Sam 

        These verses teach that the LORD Jehovah would have a Son
the Messiah
        In the second example McConkie cited Ps  This examination
will include verse  Notice that it is the LORD Jehovah who says
Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee

  I will declare the decree the LORD Jehovah hath said unto me Thou
  art my Son this day have I begotten thee
  Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance
  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession

        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are clearly Messianic
and he acknowledged they teach that Christ would come as the Son of
God What he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these
Scriptures also teach that the Father is Jehovah and that the
sectarians who believe Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son is
Jesus Christ the Only Begotten are right in their belief

        Another example involves Mic  Of this verse McConkie stated
the following

  And so truly did our Lord act during his mortal ministry Truly
  this is he of whom it is written He shall stand and feed in the
  strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the LORD his
  God for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth Mic
   Promised Messiah p  emphasis added

        According to McConkie the pronoun He at the beginning of Mic
 refers to Christ during his mortal ministry Who then is the
LORD his God Mic  reads

  And he Christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD
  Jehovah in the majesty of the name of the LORD Jehovah his God
  Elohim for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth

        Obviously the LORD of Jesus Christ is Jehovah the Father who
is referred to as Jehovah his Elohim

        Another example involves Ps  and Isa  Of these verses
McConkie stated the following

  A number of Messianic passages speak of the Lord andhis
  anointed Ps  signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated
  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his Jesus
  applied these passages to himself by quoting Isaiah's prophecy The
  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek Isa
   and then saying This day is this scripture fulfilled in your
  ears Luke  Promised Messiah pp  emphasis added

        The first source McConkie quoted  Ps   reads as follows

  The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel
  together against the LORD Jehovah and against his anointed

        McConkie said the anointed one was Christ If that is true
who was Jehovah If Jehovah is always Christ who was the anointed
one Obviously Jehovah is referring to God the Father and the
anointed is indeed referring to Christ The second source McConkie
cited is Isa  which states

  The Spirit of the Lord Adonai GOD Jehovah is upon me because the
  LORD Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek
  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to
  the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound

        The one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open
was Jesus Christ Who then was the one who anointed Him This verse
says the LORD Jehovah did the anointing Again we face the same
problem If Jehovah does not refer to the Father but only to Christ
then Jesus anointed someone but who As McConkie pointed out Jesus
applied these passages to himself Therefore the Jehovah who
anointed Christ is God the Father

        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other
Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not Jehovah
However these should be enough to expose their error

        Now what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is Jehovah but
He is not Elohim It is true that Jesus is Jehovah The following
Scriptures prove this fact

  Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the King of Israel and his redeemer
  the LORD Jehovah of hosts I am the first and I am the last and
  beside me there is no God Isa 
  Jesus said I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and
  was dead Rev 

  saith the LORD Jehovahthey shall look upon me whom they have
  pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only
  son Zech 
  Behold he Christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him
  and they also which pierced him Rev 

  I am the LORD Jehovah thy God the Holy One of Israel Isa
  
  Ye denied the Holy One Christ and the Just Acts 

  And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of
  the LORD Jehovah shall be delivered Joel 
  the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareththere is none other name
  under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Acts 

  Behold the Lord GOD Jehovah will come with strong handhis
  reward is with him Isa 
  Behold I Christ come quickly and my reward is with me Rev
  

  the LORD Jehovah my God shall come and all the saints with
  thee Zech 
  at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints 
  Thess 

  The LORD Jehovah is my shepherd Ps 
  Jesus said I am the good shepherd John 

  saith the Lord GOD Jehovah I will seek that which was lost
  Ezek 
  the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
  Luke 

  For I am the LORD Jehovah thy God the Holy One of Israel thy
  Saviour Isa 
  Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great
  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ Tit  See also Jer  and
  Rev  Mal  and Heb   Kin  and John 
  Isa  and  Tim  Ps  and Matt  Prov and
  Rev 

        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah they
are wrong when they say He is not Elohim The Bible reveals that
Jehovah is the only true Elohim there is all others are false
Remember Jehovah is the personal name of the triune God who has
revealed Himself in the Bible

        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah and
Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note
that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as Jehovah
and Elohim but so is the Holy Spirit

  Whereof the Holy GhostsaidThis is the covenant that I
  will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my
  laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them And
  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more Heb 
  emphasis on Holy Ghost and said added
  Behold the days come saith the LORD Jehovah that I will make a
  new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah
  I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts
  and will be their God Elohim and they shall be my people I will
  forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more Jer
   emphasis added

  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy
  men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost  Pet 
  emphasis on Holy Ghost added
  The Spirit of the LORD Jehovah spake by me and his word was in
  my tongue  Sam  See also Heb  with Ps 

        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that
Jehovah and Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons claim

  And when the LORD Jehovah saw that he Moses turned aside to see
  God Elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said
  Moses Moses And he said Here am I Bruce R McConkie
  acknowledged that it was Christ's voice that spoke to Moses in the
  burning bush Promised Messiah p 
  And the LORD Jehovah said
  And Moses said unto God Elohim Behold when I come unto the
  children of Israel and shall say unto them The God Elohim of your
  fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me What is his
  name what shall I say unto them
  And God Elohim said unto Moses I AM THAT I AM and he said Thus
  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I AM hath sent me unto
  you
  And God Elohim said moreover unto Moses Thus shalt thou say unto
  the children of Israel the LORD Jehovah God Elohim of your
  fathers the God Elohim of Abraham the God Elohim of Isaac and
  the God Elohim of Jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for
  ever and this is my memorial unto all generations Exod
  

  And God Elohim spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the LORD
  Jehovah Exod 

  I am the LORD Jehovah and there is none else there is no God
  Elohim beside me I girded thee though thou hast not known me
  Isa 

  But the LORD Jehovah is the true God Elohim he is the living God
  Elohim and an everlasting king Jer 

  Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the King of Israel and his redeemer
  the LORD Jehovah of hosts I am the first and I am the last and
  beside me there is no God Elohim Isa 

  Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus
  saith the LORD Jehovah whose name is The God Elohim of hosts
  Amos 

  Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's
  Jehovah's thy God Elohim the earth also with all that therein
  is Deut 

  Wherefore thou art great O LORD Jehovah God Elohim for there is
  none like thee neither is there any God Elohim beside thee
  according to all that we have heard with our ears  Sam 

  And he said unto them I am an Hebrew and I fear the LORD Jehovah
  the God Elohim of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land
  Jon 

  For who is God Elohim save the LORD Jehovah or who is a rock
  save our God Elohim Ps 

  Blessed is the nation whose God Elohim is the LORD Jehovah
  Ps  See also Ps 

  Hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting God
  Elohim the LORD Jehovah the Creator of the ends of the earth
  fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his
  understanding Isa 

  The mighty God Elohim even the LORD Jehovah hath spoken and
  called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down
  thereof Ps 

  Sing unto God Elohim sing praises to his name estol him that
  rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH and rejoice before him Ps
   Regarding the word Jah Bruce R McConkie stated Jah
  Hebrew Yah is a contracted form of Jehovah Jahveh or Yahweh  all
  of which names have reference to Christ the God of Israel Mormon
  Doctrine p 

  And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from
  Baale of Judah to bring up from thence the ark of God Elohim whose
  name is called by the name of the LORD Jehovah of hosts that
  dwelleth between the cherubims  Sam 

  the Great the Mighty God Elohim the LORD Jehovah of hosts is
  his name Jer 

  O my God Elohim make them like a wheel as the stubble before the
  wind
  Fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name O LORD
  Jehovah
  That men may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH art the most
  high over all the earth Ps 

        The Bible clearly teaches that Jehovah is Elohim In fact
He is the only Elohim there is He is the true the living the
mighty the great and the everlasting Elohim He is the Elohim
of Israel of all the kingdoms of the earth and of the heavens He is
the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and
all that dwell thereon Jehovah's name is Elohim of hosts Amos


        Not only is Jehovah Elohim but Elohim is Jehovah The
Bible reveals that Elohim's name is Jah Ps  Jehovah Ps
 and Jehovah of hosts  Sam  Jer    The nation
whose Elohim is Jehovah is blessed Ps  Clearly this is not
the Jehovah and Elohim of the Mormons

        Another Mormon error regarding Elohim and Jehovah is the
belief that Elohim not Jehovah is the Father of all the spirits
including Jesus In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E Talmage
A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve apostles
states that God the Eternal Father'Elohim' is the literal Parent
ofthe spirits of the human race p  This Doctrinal
Exposition also states explicitly that Jesus Christ is not the Father
of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth
for He is one of them He is The Son as they are sons and daughters of
Elohim p 

        The Apostle Talmage stated that Elohimis the nametitle of
God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit is
Jehovah Jesus the Christ p 

        The Apostle Bruce R McConkie stated the following about this
matter JehovahChristdid in fact create the earth and all forms
of plant and animal life on the face thereof But when it came to
placing man on earth there was a change in Creators That is the
Father himself became personally involved All things were created by
the Son using the power delegated by the Father except man In the
spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the Father There was
no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was
concerned Promised Messiah p  emphasis added

        Mormon leaders claim that JehovahChrist did not create either
man's spirit or his body They maintain that the Mormon Elohim who is
the father created man both in spirit and body The Bible reveals the
truth about who created man

  And Moses spake unto the LORD Jehovah saying
  Let the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of the spirits of all
  flesh set a man over the congregation Num  See also
   emphasis added

  the LORD Jehovah which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth
  the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within
  him Zech  emphasis added

  the LORD Jehovahmade us this soul Jer 

  For I will not contend for ever neither will I be always wroth for
  the spirit should fail before me and the souls which I have
  made
  saith the LORD Jehovah Isa  emphasis on soulsI
  have made added

  Behold I am the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of all flesh
  Jer  emphasis added

  Thus saith the LORD Jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee
  from the womb
  I am the LORD Jehovah that maketh all things Isa 
  emphasis added

  Thus saith the LORD Jehovah
  I have made the earth and created man upon it Isa 
  emphasis added

  God Elohim created man upon the earth
  Unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the LORD
  Jehovah he is God Elohim there is none else beside him Deut
  

  Thus saith God El the LORD Jehovahhe that spread forth the
  earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the
  people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein Isa 

  Thus saith the LORD Jehovah of hosts the God Elohim of
  Israel I have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon
  the ground Jer  most emphasis added

        The Bible reveals that it is Jehovah who is the Elohim of the
spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself that it was He who
formed the spirit of man within him that He made us this soul and
formed us from the womb He did indeed create man

        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah
then they are wrong when they say he did not create man If they are
right when they say the father is the one who created man then they are
wrong when they say he is not Jehovah

        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man
Mormon scriptures teach that he did The BoM states the following

  Behold I am Jesus Christ I am the Father and the Son
  And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created for
  never has man believed in me as thou hast
  Behold this body which ye now behold is the body of my spirit and
  man have I created after the body of my spirit Eth 
  emphasis added

  For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is I
  that hath created them Mos  emphasis added

  the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of
  Jacobis that same God who created the heavens and the earth and
  all things that in them are
  Behold he created Adam Mor  emphasis added

        DC  states that the worlds were made by him Christ
men were made by him all things were made by him and through him
and of him emphasis added

        Another error by Bruce R McConkie involving Jehovah and his
creation is the belief that Jehovah had many premortal spirits
helping him create Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith Jr

  That he Christ was aided in the creation of this earth by many of
  the noble and great spirit children of the Father is evident from
  Abraham's writings Unto those superior spirits Christ said We will
  go down for there is space there and we will take of these
  materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell Abra
   Michael or Adam was one of these Enoch Noah Abraham
  Moses Peter James and John Joseph Smith and many other noble and
  great ones played a part in the great creative enterprise Doctrines
  of Salvation vol  pp  Mormon Doctrine p 

        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter

  Thus saith the LORD Jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee
  from the womb I am the LORD Jehovah that maketh all things that
  stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by
  myself Isa 

  Which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of
  the sea Job 

        Jehovah by Himself created all things He had no alleged
preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him

        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim the Apostle McConkie stated
Elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted
nametitle of God the Eternal Father a usage that connotes his
supremacy and omnipotence he being God above all Gods Mormon
Doctrine p  He also stated that Jesusis above all save the
Father only Promised Messiah p 

        The Bible states that the One who is God above all socalled
gods is the triune God Jehovah

  For the LORD Jehovah is a great God El and a great King above
  all gods Elohim Ps 

  For thou LORD Jehovah art high above all the earth thou art
  exalted far above all gods Elohim Ps 

  Now I know that the LORD Jehovah is greater than all gods
  Elohim Exod  See also Ps  Deut 

        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jehovah is god the
son and Elohim is god the father these verses from the Bible would be
teaching that the Mormon son is above his father However as McConkie
clearly stated Mormons believe Elohim the father not Jehovah the
son is the God above all Gods  that Jesus is above all except the
father yet the Bible teaches that Jehovah is above all Elohim

        At a BYU Dev on March   Bruce R McConkie made the
following remark about praying to Jesus

  Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly
  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been
  developed
  This is plain sectarian nonsense Our prayers are addressed to the
  Father and to him only
  Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father in the name of the Son
  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost Our Relationship With
  the Lord pp 

        McConkie states on p  of his book Promised Messiah that the
Mormons pray to the Father not the Son On p  of the same book
McConkie states that Christ the Son is Jehovah This is important to
remember because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to
the Mormon Christ who is Jehovah the Bible states repeatedly in the
OT that people prayed to Jehovah and He not only heard those prayers
but He accepted them as valid requests The following is but a small
sample of the vast number of times people prayed to Jehovah

  In my distress I called upon the LORD Jehovah and cried unto my
  God Elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came
  before him even into his ears Ps 

  And the LORD Jehovah said unto him I have heard thy prayer and thy
  supplication that thou hast made before me I have hallowed this
  house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine
  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually  Kin 

  And said unto Jeremiah the prophet Let we beseech thee our
  supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the LORD
  Jehovah thy God Elohim even for all this remnant Jer 

  O LORD Jehovah I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to
  the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who
  desire to fear thy name Neh 

  And it was so that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
  prayer and supplication unto the LORD Jehovah he arose from before
  the altar of the LORD Jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his
  hands spread up to heaven  Kin 

  He went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed
  unto the LORD Jehovah  Kin 

  Go and say to Hezekiah Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the God
  Elohim of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy
  tears behold I will add unto thy days fifteen years Isa 

  I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I
  said I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD Jehovah and
  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin
  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
  thou mayest be found Ps 

        Notice above in Ps  that the godly pray to Jehovah
According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders that is Christ the very
one to whom McConkie said people should not pray

        The Bible reveals there is only one true Elohim and His name
is Jehovah All other Elohim are false They are idols that cause
their followers to commit adultery against the true Elohim and
idolatry

  For the LORD Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised he is to
  be feared above all gods Elohim
  For all the gods Elohim of the nations are idols but the LORD
  Jehovah made the heavens Ps 

  Thou shalt have no other gods Elohim before me Exod 

  Now I know that the LORD Jehovah is greater than all gods
  Elohim Exod 

  And it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD Jehovah thy God
  Elohim and walk after other gods Elohim and serve them and
  worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely
  perish Deut 

  Thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods Elohim
  They shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me
  for if thou serve their gods Elohim it will surely be a snare unto
  thee Exod  

  Take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn
  aside and serve other gods Elohim and worship them Deut 

  That ye come not among these nations these that remain among you
  neither make mention of the name of their gods Elohim nor cause to
  swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them
  Josh 

  neither walk after other gods Elohim to your hurt Jer 

  But the LORD Jehovah is the true God Elohim he is the living God
  Elohim Jer 

  And they forsook the LORD Jehovah God Elohim of their fathers
  which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods
  Elohim of the gods Elohim of the people that were round about
  them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the LORD Jehovah
  to anger Jud 

  Shall a man make gods Elohim unto himself and they are no gods
  Elohim Therefore behold I will this once cause them to know I
  will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know
  that my name is the LORD Jehovah  Jer 

  And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD Jehovah choose you
  this day whom ye will serve whether the gods Elohim which your
  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods
  Elohim of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my
  house we will serve the LORD Jehovah
  And the people answered and said God Elohim forbid that we should
  forsake the LORD Jehovah to serve other gods Elohim Josh
  

        These verses teach that the only true living Elohim in heaven
and on earth is Jehovah  the triune God who made heaven and earth
and all therein

        Jehovah is greater than any Elohim because all other
Elohim are idols The reality behind them is demonic Deut 
Jehovah Elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding
these false Elohim He told His people not to have any Elohim but
Him He told the people that if they left Him for the false Elohim
those Elohim would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and
would perish He warned the people to take heed that their heart be
not deceived into worshiping serving swearing by and making
covenants with false Elohim Jehovah Elohim told His people He would
eventually judge all false Elohim and their followers

        Despite these warnings and guidelines Elohim's covenant
people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false Elohim's of
the people they came in contact with Ju  states that the children
of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD Jehovah and served
Baalim and Ashtaroth and the gods Elohim of Syria and the gods
Elohim of Zidon and the gods Elohim of Moab and the gods Elohim
of the children of Ammon and the gods Elohim of the Philistines and
forsook the LORD Jehovah and served not him

        This examination has shown that the Elohim of Mormonism like
the Elohim in Ju  is not the true Jehovah Elohim Therefore
the people who leave the true Elohim for the Mormon Elohim will do
evilin the sight of the LORD Jehovah

        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a
triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father
Jehovah sent His Son into the world these beliefs are true God is
triune He is Spirit He is Jehovah and He did send His Son into the
world to redeem mankind

        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the
Christians who thrash around indarkness about who Elohim and
Jehovah are One wonders what Holy Writ McConkie had in mind when he
stated that it attests to the fact that Elohim is the Father and that
Jehovah is the Son He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches
that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are all the one Jehovah Elohim
He apparently did not mean the DC either because chapter  verses
  refer to the Father as
Jehovah

Summary

        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons
have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God Doctrines
of Salvation  is not accurate The Mormon gods are not the true
God as Mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to
commit adultery against God and idolatry

        In answer to Jesus' question But whom say ye that I am
Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in
the Bible and whom the apostles preached Therefore anyone trusting in
the Mormon Jesus is believing in another Jesus whom Paul warned about

        Bernard P Brockbank of the First Quorum of the Seventy
admitted in the May  issue of The Ensign a Mormon publication that
the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus He stated that
it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different
Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latterday Saints p 

        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing
adultery against God and idolatry They do not have the Son therefore
they do not have the Father and they do not have eternal life As the
Apostle Bruce R McConkie rightly stated Salvation comes only by
worshiping the true God Promised Messiah p  McConkie also
rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper
scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and
living God because the true names of Deity can be applied to false
concepts of God Mormon Doctrine p  Remember that the Apostle
Stephen L Richards admitted that Joseph Smith Jr gave a new
conception of God and the Godhead Contributions of Joseph Smith p


        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God
revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him They must forsake the
sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism
The Bible says

  all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from
  me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the LORD
  Jehovah the fountain of living waters Jer 

  And it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD Jehovah thy God
  Elohim and walk after other gods Elohim and serve them and
  worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely
  perish Deut 

  Thou shalt make no covenant withtheir gods Elohim Exod 

  Put away the strange gods Elohim that are among you and be
  clean and change your garments Gen 

  flee from idolatry  Cor 

        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible
If they do they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and
idolatry Remember to know the only true God is eternal life John


  their gods Elohim shall be a snare unto you Ju  See also
  Exod

According to CNN last night Saturday  he has now found bullets
in two of the corpses in the head that would indicate that the bullets
were aimed at killing the humans

Even though a newborn is innocent as can be his sinful nature
will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older  For
as surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth
he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebelling
against mommy and daddy with that loud proclamation No

That's not showing the signs of his innate sin that's testing the
limits of his newfound independence  A twoyearold will continually
test you to see just how much he can get away with just as a pet dog
will

If a child always submitted to your will in a docile fashion would
you praise him and suspect that he's the Second Coming of Christ or
would you seek professional help about his emotional development

 If I make a statement That God exists loves me etc but in no way
 insist that you believe it does that place a burden of proof upon me
 If you insist that God doesn't exist does that place a burden of proof 
 upon you  I give no proofs I only give testimony to my beliefs  I will
 respond to proofs that you attempt to disprove my beliefs

If you say X statement and give it the authority of fact I will respond
by asking you why You aren't obligated to say anything but if your
intent is to convince me that X statement is true then yes the burden
of proof is upon you 

If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by 
experiment and observation then I would agree with you Chris  
The burden of proof would belong to Bill But the source
document for Christianity the Bible simply assumes God exists
and makes it clear to us Calvinists anyway  that when a person
is in fellowship with God it is because God has taken the initiative
in revealing Himself to that person So from a Christian point of
view the burden of proof belongs to God Bill is being consistent
with what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God
but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct
causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming
convinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God


If you are merely giving testimony to your beliefs then you are an egotist

Please excuse me if I missed an earlier part of this thread
in which Bill came across like an egotist What I saw was simply
obedience to the scriptural command to always be ready
to give a reason for the joy that is in you

Kent with regards to the information contained in the Bible which
is the original context of this thread Brian Kendig is inside a huge
wall  Brian IS inside  The Bible and the information contained therein
are outside the wall

Um I think you and the Bible are the ones inside the wall  There's a
really wonderful world out here  You really should peek out at it sometime

The silly things you keep saying only reinforce the fact that we are
on opposite sides of a very high wall  I see how incredibly beautiful
things are on my side and I only keep telling you about it because
I'd like to you come join me here

Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the
absurd things he says  For example If I get through into the firey
pit I will cease to exist

I never said that  I said that I would PREFER to cease to exist than
to be tossed into any god's version of Hell

I am proposing to Brian Brian come up here
and take a look from this vantage point   But Brian replies I rather
not thank you  I am content where I am  Besides the vista from up
there stinks   And in the meanwhile Brian ignores the facts that
he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same
plateau where Brian now stands

You say to me Brian come up here and take a look from this vantage
point  But you're in a valley looking at a crayon drawing of a sun
and a tree and I can't for the life of me figure out why you're so
immersed in it  I'm the one trying to get you to come up HERE
don't you see

	I'm not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so
neatly or at all  A myth is more than a single story  The thought 
structure and worldparadigm in which that story is interpreted is as
important a part of the myth as the story itself  Thus I can think of
no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person
to another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying
thought structure and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical
truths along with it

 One more thought  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic
 weapons on the premises 
 
         HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE  CALIBER MACHINE GUN
 
 THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY
 
 Still without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him
 For all of this my President takes full responsibility  What a guy
 I hope he gets it
 
 	The cal gun was a semiauto and was thus legal The BATF
 	claims that the Davidians also possessed illegally modified

If you check the news today AP the authorities also found a stateoftheart
automatic machine gun that investigators did not know was in the cult's arsenal
Carl Stern Justice Department

I imagine the authorities know the difference between semi and fully automatic
and probably knew weather the guns were legal as they have access to any relative
documentation ie permits  In addition the  caliber guns plural were
semiautomatic rifles

 You think on that
 
Did you by any chance see the pictures of the agents in flak jackets climbing
up on the roof and breaking windows  You call that peaceful  If you
believed as these people did that they would be attacked by evil forces
from the outside found the scores of agents breaking into your compound
what would you do  Your beliefs always determine your actions  The
beliefs may be wrong from my point of view but they are yours all the same

To make it more practical  If I attempted to stick you with a needle you
would try to stop me because you believe it would hurt or that I do not
have that right  If you did not you would ignore me  You certainly would
it you saw me sticking the needle in a tree

Koresh may have been misguided only God knows  But the Jews at Masada
died for what they believed the three Hebrews preferred to die in the
furnace rather than bow down Daniel preferred to die in a lion's den
rather than stop praying to his God and as a Christian I am prepared to
die for my faith

Koresh was not dying for now reason  He had a cause  Why should he give
up the children to forces he was convinced were evil  The events are
bizarre but they match his beliefs

 Recently I've asked myself a rather interesting question What RIGHT does
 god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of course 
 
 In his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
 according to his rules we will burn in hell Well with what RIGHT can god
 make that desicion Let's say for the sake of argument that god creates every
 one of us directly or indirectly it doesn't matter What then happens is
 that he first creates us and then turns us lose Well I didn't ask to be
 created 
 
 Let's make an analogue If a scientist creates a unique living creature which
 has happened it was even patented does he then have the right to
 expect it to behave in a certain matter or die
 
 Who is god to impose its rules on us  Who can tell if god is REALLY so
 righteous as god likes us to believe Are all christians a flock of sheep
 unable to do otherwise that follow the rest 
 
 Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
 
 I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm I mean it

 Bottom line due process was not served  No peaceful attempt to serve
 a warrant occurred
 
 The peaceful attempt to serve the warrant was met with gunfire Due process
 was not served because the Branch Davidians wanted it that way
 
 You think on that

I am not exactly known as a Flower Child Pacifist but lets call
cowpoop cowpoop

The peaceful attempt to serve the warrant consisted of the following
actions in order

 BATF agents forcing their entry of the compound through second
story windows

 BATF agents loosing some grenades allegedly stun or flash
grenades which promptly detonated

After which according to the tapes I have seen the BD
started shooting back

Now exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property
and tossing grenades around is considered peaceful by
anyone You think on that

Which is not to say I do not still hold my previous and
entirely correct notions about what should be worn and
what arms should be used in assaulting a building

 These are two conflicting statements  To say one is a clarification of the
 other is a breach of logic  I don't mind people shifting their position on
 an issue  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change
 was made  What about Deuteronomy   Is it wrong now  Did Jesus
 change that
 
  If anything He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made  In the
  following verses Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
  the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended
 
 Sure he does this  However he doesn't address the notion of stoning
 nonvirgin brides because this needs no clarification  Are you going to
 deny that Deuteronomy  is not patently clear in its intent


I see what you are getting at or at least I think I do  Correct me if
I am mistaken but I think you are asking me if I still believe that we
should uphold all of the Laws pertaining to capital punishment for such
things as adultery rape and other heinous crimes  As you may recall
Jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress
who was caught in the act and brought before Jesus  And His reply Let
he who is without sin cast the first stone  Jesus does not deny the
sentence that is to due for this violation of the Law  What do you think
of this

 
  I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world a lot of
  modernday Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
  in it  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart
 
 I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible
 from end to end and don't believe in it  Depending on how they use this
 knowledge they can be scary  They can argue any position they desire and
 back it up with selected parts of the Bible  Such Pharisees include David
 Koresh and Adolph Hitler  I will qualify this by saying I don't know if
 they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly
 made the means look frightening


Agreed  
 
 However just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible but
 believe every word  In fact this is probably scarier since there are far
 more of these people from what I've seen  In addition they are very easy
 to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees since they don't know enough
 to debate with these people
 

Agreed also  If one is to use the Bible as a reference one must always be
open to different interpretations  As a Christian I have the Spirit of God
to verify what I believe in the Word  If what the Spirit tells me is not
backed up in scripture then the spirit I am communicating with is not of
God  After all Jesus tells us to test the spirits to know for sure that
it is from God


  Christianity is not just a set of rules it's a lifestyle that changes one's
  perspectives and personal conduct  And it demands obedience to God's will
 
 No it demands obedience to a book  If God came down and personally told
 me how I should behave then I would say that I would be doing God's will
 by doing it  However if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to
 obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to
 two millenia even longer for the OT even if I follow everything in it
 with my heart I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing
 the will of God


I obey what the Spirit of God tells me to do  The Spirit will not violate
anything that is written in the Bible because that is the Word of God  I do
not worship pastors preachers my wife my mother or my father  What they
tell me does not carry the weight of what God tells me to do and His commands
are rienforced in the Bible
 
  Some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  That is
  their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too
 
 Well if God respects it so much how come there is talk in the Bible about
 eternal damnation for nonbelievers  I see little respect eminating from
 the god of the Bible  I see a selfish and spiteful god


Eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting
God  If you choose to jump off a cliff you can hardly blame God for you 
going splat at the bottom  He knows that if you choose to jump that 
you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice  In fact
He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what
lies below  To prove that point Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being
God was able to rise up again  I have seen the example of Christ and have 
chosen not to jump and I'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you'll 
go splat
 
You don't have to listen to me and I won't stop you if you decide to jump
I only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge  You owe it to
yourself  I don't like seeing anyone go splat

God be with you

an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
certain physical observable properties of our surroundings  All
of which is subjective

 BTW the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in the
 very physical reality of the universe 

This sounds interesting but what exactly do you mean  

Well the best thing to do is to read the book Parallel Universes
by Dr Fred Wolf 

In essence Dr Wolf says that one interpretation of the subatomic
particlewave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually
an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid and in each of
these universes there is a particle in a different location When we
do something to make a particle appear we are actually causing
all the parallel universes to collapse into one Apparently this is
one line of thought on the nature of QM that is going through some
of the scientific community

Dr Wolf and many others claim that somehow the collapse is caused
by the mental effort of observing the particle This implys that
mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon He then extrapolates
that if mind is an integral part of the universe then perhaps consciousness
is the element that gives order and form to the universes itthemselfs

It all gets rather interesting but what I find facinating is that
this would explain the phenomenon of magick as practiced in my
religion Dr Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind
could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of
possible futures he says that this might be done by some sort of
communication between ones current and possible future selves 
I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self
delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection
of one of many possible futures

I realize that this gets pretty bizarre but it never hurts to keep 
an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile 
explaination of the world in which we find ourselves After all the
more we learn about the universe in which we live the more we learn
that it is truly a very strange place

Frank unless you didn't realize it you are just now involved
in a debate where we have various opinions and each entity
has its own frame where the opinion is expressed I think I 
don't need to state the dreadful rword

So it's sometimes correct to say that morality is objective or what

If you were able to prove that morality is objective then it would
be correct to do so The problem is by the very meaning of the
words in question to do so is oxymoronic Of course you could
redefine the words but that would still not lend support to the
underlying concept

After all I could hardly be wrong without dragging in the oword

This does not parse How could you hardly be wrong without dragging
in the oword

For your part when you say that relativism is true that's just
your opinion  Why do folk get so heated then if a belief in relativism
is merely a matter of taste  to be fair you have been very calm
I get the impression that's because you don't care about notions of
objectivity in any flavour  Right

I have no problem with objectivity at all It is my objectivity that
has led me to conclude that morality is subjective

 Since everywhere I look Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable
 descendant of Daniel suppose you prove he wasn't

Zoroaster is far older than Daniel If anything one could claim that
in a sense Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster as Daniel though being
Hebrew has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully
introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism However the majority 
of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic not Babylonian Aramaic and only has
Kethuvim or Writing status

Ref Encyclopedia of Religion Mircea Eliade

DANIEL or in Hebrew Daniyye'l hero of the biblical book that bears his name
Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in
the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his
salvation from death in a lion's pit He also appears in the last chapters of
the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's
restoration to nationalreligious autonomy As a practitioner of oneiromancy in
the court described in Daniel  written in the third person Daniel per
forms his interpretations alone while as a visionaryapocalyptist in Daniel
 written in the first person he is in need of an angel to help him
decode his visions and mysteries of the future It is likely that the name
Daniel is pseudonymous a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known
from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition Ez 
  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative
voices and content but by its language Daniel a and  are written in
Hebrew whereas Daniel b is in Aramaic The language division parallels
the subject division Daniel  concerns legends and dream interpretations
 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies The
overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances Daniel 
is chiliastically related suggest an attempt at redactional unity After the
prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some
youths to their ancestral religion a chronological ordering is discernable a
sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported Dn  Much of
this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic for example
Daniel  speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast a story that
is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus Belshazzar is portrayed as the
last king of Babylon although he was never king and Darius is called a Mede
who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia although no such
Darius is known the Medes followed the Persians and Darius is the name of
several Persian kings Presumably the episodes of Daniel  depicting a
series of monarchical reversals episodes of ritual observances and reports of
miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period late fourth to
midsecond century BCE in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine
providence and encourage steadfast faith
  The visions of Daniel  reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to
that of Cyrus II but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in
Palestine were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior
to the Maccabean Revolt for it was then beginning in  BCE that the Jews
were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral
traditions and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a
martyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion All of the visions
of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways for example via images of
the enthronement of a God of judgment with a son of man invested with rule
this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians
as Christ in chapter  via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre
manifestations as in chapter  or via complex reinterpretations of ancient
prophecies especially those of Jeremiah  as found in Daniel 
  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter  paralleled by the image of four
metals in chapter  representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth
monarchy of divine origin is one of the enduring images of the book it sur
vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes
to the end of the Middle Ages The role and power of this imagery in the
fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel the
scientist Isaac Newton and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth
Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England for example is abiding testimony
to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of
diverse thinkers and groups The schema is still used to this day by various
groups predicting the apocalyptic advent
  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and
propagandized in Daniel  contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah
 regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as
the select faithful Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor
the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt they rather
advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation
Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael and the
martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality Persumably the
circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may
reflect some protoPharisaic group of hasidim or pietists The themes of
resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic
integrity the overthrow of historical dominions and the acknowledgement of
the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of
trust for the faithful in their darkest hour

ZARATHUSHTRA founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism from
Mazda or Ahura Mazda the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra The
etymology and history of Zarathushtra the Avestan and oldest form of the name
as uncertain both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else
where There may have been an Old Persian form Zaraushtra from which the
Greek form Zoroastres may be derived and there may have existed an Old
Iranian form Zaratushtra to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht
several Middle Persian forms such as Zrtwsht and the New Persian Zardusht
We can state with certainty only that the second half of the name ushtra
means camel The form Zoroaster derived from the Greek Zoroastres was used
traditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century when
Zarathustra closer to the original and as found in Nietzsche came into
common use after the rediscovery of the Avesta the collection of sacred books
of Zoroastrianism and the resulting studies in Iranian philology See Avesta
  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra even in
Western culture the sources available to us are few extremely fragmented
and heterogeneous Our principle sources are the five Gathas songs
attributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the
Avesta Gatha Ahunavaiti Yasna  Gatha Ushtavaiti Yasna  Gatha
Spentamainyu Yasna  Gatha Vokukhshathra Yasna  and Gatha
Vashishtoishti Yasna  the last of which was probably written after the
prophet's death
  Other sources of considerable albeit varying importance are the Younger
Avesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature in particular the
Pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE Although the Achaemenid
inscriptions sixth to fourth centures BCE never mention Zarathushtra he is
mentioned by some Greek sources of the time not however by Herodotus who
seems unaware of him
  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true
chronological history of Zarathushtra But the text is useful in an indirect
way as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose
was not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians The Greek sources on the
other hand do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra
although from a historical point of view they are unreliable Some place him
six thousand years before the Trojan War Xanthus of Lydia Eudoxus of Cnidus
Hermippus Hermodorus Aristotle Plutarch Diogenes Laertius and Pliny The
account by Xanthus of Lydia however has also been interpreted by some to mean
six hundred rather than six thousand years before the expedition of Xerxes
against Greece This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius who makes
reference to Xanthus but although a few scholars A S Shabazi Helmut
Humbach have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts it
is generally rejected
  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible they are
nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history
of the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period as
the above account would seem to demonstrate They also show that by this time
Zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure one from an
extremely distant past All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet
could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with or even close
to that of the Achaemenids
  Later Zoroastrian sources the Pahlavi texts do provide an absolute chrono
logy for Zarathushtra one that was also accepted by some Arab authors Accord
ing to these sources Zarathushtra lived  or  years before Alexander
Again scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology some view it as
historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical
justification The most convincing arguments however seem to support the
latter position The figure of  years is accurate only on the surface
because it represents in fact the more general one of  which was employed
by Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the
beginning of Iranian domination For a number of reasons connected with complex
problems inherent in the Iranian chronology there was also a desire on the
part of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat In this
context Zarathushtra whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after
the beginning of the cosmos converted Vishtaspa at the age of fortytwo and
Vishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium
thus explaining the double date of  and  years before Alexander
  Given the unreliability of the few available sources we are forced to
reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements principally
on the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus
the Great Cambyses and Darius as there is no mention in the Avesta of the
great political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of
the first millennium BCE Nor is there any mention of the history of that
period which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance At the same
time for a number of reasons going back much further in history would not be
justified Consequently the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara
thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the
most legitimate
  As to Zarathushtra's land of origin many scholars agree on the basis of
valid arguments that he must have come from eastern Iran Some have held that
he was a Mede largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra
with Azerbaijan but also because of linguistic reasons based on the language
of the Avesta This hypothesis however should be discarded as we can suppose
both on historical and linguistic grounds that Zarathushtra came from the east
even though we do not know precisely from which region There is a considerable
variety of opinion on this particular matter including the improbable view
that he came from Chorasmia or presentday Khorezm or from a wider Chorasmian
region reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat Most likely however
Zarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the
Hindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia
modern Qandahar as well as Drangiana the area of lake Helmand It would
thus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran
  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste Yasna
 He was a zaotar cf Sanskrit hotr that is a priest belonging to a
specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned
religious poetry Even in the socalled Younger Avesta he is described as an
athravan Yashts  a more general term encompassing the entire priestly
caste To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training which he used
to lend dignity as in the Gathas to the contents of his new message the
product of a great and original ethical mind
  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition linking India
to Iran in another way by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan
or possessor of asha that is the one who as in the Vedic rtavan seeks
truth and masters it thus becoming ashavan in this life  almost an initiate 
and blessed after death Any good follower of such teachings seeks the vision
of asha just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the
vision of the Sun a manifestation of rta Behind these concepts and this
language lies the great tradition of Aryan mysticism that is of IndoIranian
mysticism
  Zarathushtra's greatness however does not lie in his having belonged to a
particular religious tradition Rather it lies in the innovation and strength
of his message which was in itself a break in the tradition one that force
fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas dualistic
monotheism the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits the beneficent and the
evil and the expectation of a transfiguration Av Frashokereti Pahl
Frashgird of life and existence See Frashokereti 
  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological
doctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the IndoIranian tradi
tions of his upbringing They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic
and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem
of evil Because of his basic tenets Zarathushtra who advocated an inward
religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi
tion can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures
  Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message one that is not easy to
understand but which however holds the key to a deeper understanding of the
complex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas is the doctrine of the
Amesha Spentas the beneficent immortals These are spiritualizations of the
abstract notions of good thought best truth desirable power bounteous
devotion wholeness and immortality all of which operate according to a
system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the
manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue See Amesha Spentas
  Other than the names of his father Pourushaspa possessing gray horses
and of his mother Dughdova one who has milked we know almost nothing of
Zarathushtra's life A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers
According to tradition Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty and at
thirty he was subject to a revelation both through an intense and powerful
inspiration and through a vision Only after ten years had passed however did
he succeed in converting a cousin of his Maidhyoimah to his beliefs He was
strongly opposed in his native land by kavis karapans and usijs priestly
groups associated with traditional teachings and practices This hostility
caused him to leave his region Yasna  and to seek refuge at the court of
Kavi Vishtaspa a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with
his wife Hutaosa when the prophet according to tradition was fortytwo
years old We also know the name of a son Isat Vastra desiring pastures
and of three daughters born of his first wife as well as the names of two more
sons Urvatatnara commanding men and Hvarecithra sunfaced born of
his second wife Hvovi a member of the influential Hvogva possessing good
cattle family Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned
Frashaoshtra and Jamaspa the former as Hvovi's father and the latter as the
husband of the third daughter of the prophet Pouruchista very thoughtful
whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas Yasna  Again
according to tradition Zarathushtra died at the age of seventyseven He was
assassinated by a karapan a priest of the old religion who belonged to the
Tuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres his name is known only in the Pahlavi
form
  The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi
tion rich in legendary detail that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian
communities The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of
the Denkard a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE as well as
passages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth
century the Zarathushtnama Book of Zarathushtra written by Zaratushti
Bahrami Pazhdu Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about
Zarathushtra which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the
perfect man
  Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the
Renaissance until the Enlightenment During the Classical and Hellenistic
periods he was viewed as a wise man a typical representative of an alien
wisdom a master of the secrets of heaven and earth a seer astrologer
psychologist and wonder worker Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the
influence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself and the Academicians always
openly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and
advocated a doctrine of dualism Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as
a precursor of the Christian faith one who not only prophesied as had the
biblical prophets the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural
sign of his coming the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three
Magi to the manger in Bethlehem See Magi This Christian interpretation is
derived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant the Savior of the
Future See Saoshyant Later however religious struggles arose during the
Sasanid empire in Persia third to seventh centuries CE which linked the
spread of Christianity with the Roman empire Zarathushtra's popularity in the
Christian world began to decline The Iranian prophet who had been praised
often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three
great messengers from the past was now seen instead as a leader of imposture
and heresy a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery But during the Renaiss
ance and the Enlightenment European cultures reverted to the image of Zara
thushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity He was
viewed once again as a great and wise man as the author of the Chaldean
Oracles and probably inventor of Qabbalah as a teacher of astrology as a
possible bridge between Christianity and Platonism and at times as in
Voltaire as a symbol of nonChristian wisdom
  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries Friedrich Nietzsche in an intentional paradox gave
the name Zarathustra to the hero of his work Also sprach Zarathustra 
 Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the
true motive force underlying all things that is the eternal struggle between
good and evil See also Zoroastrianism

 Please excuse me if I missed an earlier part of this thread

 obedience to the scriptural command to always be ready

The remainder of my article deleted stated why One would be an egotist to
believe that someone CARED about what Bill R thought he needed

Jumping on your trailer always be ready etc then that goes right

 Hmm it seems that this is the core of Christianity then you 
 have to feel guilty and then there's this single personality
 that will save you from this universal guilt feeling
 
 Brian I will tell you a secret I don't feel guilty at all
 I do mistakes and I regret them however I've never had this
 huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder

I will tell you another secret  I get this burning sensation in my
hand every time I hold it over a candle  The pain does not fill my entire
body and I'm told the longer I hold it here the less it'll hurt it'll
eventually burn up the nerves or so I'm told  So I suppose I should just
ignore the pain because holding my hand over the candle is something I just
want to do I've got the right don't I

Your body feels pain to let you know something is wrong  It's your body's
alarm system informing you that something needs your attention

A fever tells you that you are sick and need some sort of care

Guilt can be seen as that emotional or spiritual alarm just informing you
that there is something that you've done that requires your attention

It doesn't require a personality type to become a believer  It requires
someone who is willing to listen to themselves their body  soul  

 All I know is that I don't know everything And frankly speaking
 I don't care life is fun anyway I recognize that I'm not 
 perfect but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
 and inspiring life

For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping 'cid LSD
Frankly speaking I didn't really care  It was fun anyway

It didn't matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a 
tremendously greater risk of serious birth defects

For several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women
as I could convice  Frankly speaking I didn't care  

I didn't care that I was putting each one of them at risk as well as their
future partners

It didn't matter that for the first decade of my marriage my wife and I
will have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something much
worse than a cold

 
 There are humans that subscribe to the same notion The nice
 thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden
 the shoulders feel far more relaxed

The nice thing about pain killers if you take enough you won't care about 
the fever shortness of breath or pain

Assuming for the moment that the FBI believed in the bible and

that God is the one who has to open the seals not some

Fear doesn't usually follow reason

Nice soundbite David but not relevant  At the moment
I reason that that tornado is coming right at me I begin
to feel fear  At the moment I realize that that car coming 
toward me is in my lane I begin to feel fear 

I was responding to a post which suggested that the FBI 
attacked the compound because they were afraid Koresh would
unlock the power of the seven seals  If the FBI actually
believed tjhat Koresh could do that fear is a reasonable
reaction

Why call Koresh a prophet  Why not  My dictionary has at
least two definitions for the word that fit this situation

One who prophesies future events  Seems like Koresh fits
                                    this one nicely as he

    We are talking about origins not merely science   Science cannot
    explain origins  For a person to exclude anything but science from
    the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
    than science  This is a false premise  By the way I enjoy science
    It is truly a wonder observing God's creation  Macroevolution is
    a mixture of  percent science and  percent religion guaranteed
    within three percent error  

Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point sentence by
sentence


 We are talking about origins not merely science

Origins of what  Are we speaking of the origins of life the human
species the universe physical law biological diversity or what

 Science cannot explain origins

This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified  It depends
on what origins we are talking about

 For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins
is to say that there is no higher truth than science

Again this is a false statement  To begin with the notion of higher
truth is distinctly dubious  Many people believe that there are ways
to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science they even
believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain  Many
believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language
of science  Let it be so  These truths are neither higher or 
lower they are simply true

More to the point restricting one's discussion of origins to science
does not reject other sources of knowledge it simply restricts the
scope of discussion

 This is a false premise

If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false
then  is actually true  However the context identifies it as another
false or at least theologically unsound statement

 By the way I enjoy science

On the evidence Mr Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science
to enjoy science in any meaningful sense  One might just as well say
that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read
However one cannot mark this sentence as false  to follow the analogy
perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters

 It is truly a wonder observing God's creation

Let us not quibble count this one as true

 Macroevolution is a mixture of  percent science and  percent
religion guaranteed within three percent error  

Still another false statement  However one can make it come out true
with the following contextual modification

Macroevolution as misunderstood by Rawline is a mixture of  percent
of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science and  percent of
what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion



It is distinctly noticeable that Mr Rawlins fails miserably to touch
on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels  I do
him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his
personal reactions  One can account for this by the hypothesis that
he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth

        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and

        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony

 
Since this drivel is also crossposted to altatheism how about reading
the altatheism FAQ The Josephus quote is concidered to be a fake even
by Christian historians and the four gospels contradict each other in
important points

culled from a discussion on Christianity and objective morals

Question  Is there any effective difference between

Objective values exist and there is disagreement over what they are

and

Values are subjective

I don't see any




Is there any difference in saying 

Absolute Truth exists but some people think its a lie

and

Truth is relative 

I think there is  in both examples the first statement is a
fundamental disagreement between at least two people the 
second statement is agreed upon by all

To put it another way someone who says objective values exist
does not agree that values are subjective

Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people
of the US collectively  for all of the land in America would that 
sound like a good deal  

That happens to be a subjective example that the people of the
US would happen to agree on  Continue to move the price up 
at some point a few people would accept then more then more until 
probably all would accept at a high enough number

Endpoints of a subjective scale are not the given homes of 
objective viewpoints

Firstly science has its basis in values not the other way round
So you better explain what objective atoms are and how we get them
from subjective values before we go any further


Atoms are not objective  They aren't even real  What scientists call
an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
certain physical observable properties of our surroundings  All
of which is subjective  

What is objective though is the approach a scientist 
takes in discussing his model and his observations  There
is no objective science  But there is an objective approach
which is subjectively selected by the scientist  Objective
in this case means a specified unchanging set of rules that
he and his colleagues use to discuss their science

This is in contrast to your Objective Morality  There may be an
objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on
morality  But there exists no objective morality

Also science deals with how we can discuss our observations of 
the physical world around us  In that the method of discussion
is objective  not the science not the discussion itself 

Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes
of what we can observe  It simply gives us a way to discuss our
surroundings in a meaningful consistent way

I think it was Neils Bohr who said to paraphrase Science is what
we can say about the physical world

Omigod it's an operationalist Sorry Jim but the idea that a theory
explaining a myriad of distinctly different observations is merely a
model is more than sensible people can accept  your phobia about
objective reality notwithstanding
 
 
The point about its being real or not is that one does not waste time with
what reality might be when one wants predictions The questions if the
atoms are there or if something else is there making measurements indicate
atoms is not necessary in such a system
 
And one does not have to write a new theory of existence everytime new
models are used in Physics
 
Don't forget to prove your last sentence namely that sensible don't
accept that

Yeah  In a fire that reportedly burned hotter than  degrees hot
enough to make the bodies still unidentifiable the authorities found
a gun that was recognizably fullyautomatic and state of the art
Isn't that CONVEEEENIENT

Convenient  It seems very appropriate that this is crossposted to
altconspiracy

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your ' degree'
measurement that the temperature is in Centigrade rather than the
more common in the US Fahrenheit you are still laboring under at
least  misconceptions

  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around  C
    Actually the melting point of most iron alloys and steels are
    iron alloys is in the neighborhood of  C  Even if the gun
    were found in area which achieved the  C temperature the steel
    parts of the gun would not be deformed and it would still be
    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon

  A fire is not an isothermal process  There are 'hot' spots and
    'cold' spots though 'cold' is purely a relative term   So the
    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot as you seem to
    imply  And even if it was so what  It would not have melted
    anyway

 mleeraroyalroadsca Malcolm Lee writes
 These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had
 expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
 direct witness to God's existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God is
 real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
 Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
 God's chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
 age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
 repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
 for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
 alike
 
 Sorry if this is late for the thread but
 
 I thought God was supposed to be constant and neverchanging  How do
 you reconcile this common Christian view with the paragraph above


God never changes  

Sorry but yes he does by your own description

He still loves us  Sending Jesus was one of His attempts to
reconcile with mankind

Humorous this notion of an allknowing allpowerful god who must
attempt to reconcile with his lowly creations  I realize that it
is not possible to penetrate such logic but is there any chance that
you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything
and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of
omniscience

What you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god

 
 Also while we're at it
 
  How do you reconcile A KIND and LOVING God with the
 JudeoChristian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable
 by death  Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing
 KINDness and LOVE


Sinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate death  There are
several OT passages to back this up  God is God  

But all humans are sinners thus all preJesus humans should have been
punished with death  We aren't punished with sin now of course
because God has changed  He required a brutal sadistic sacrifice of
his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death  

He cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in His midst  

Yet he does so now  He has changed  The sadistic murder of his own
son has made him more tolerant of our sins

Besides his midst is everywhere so your statement is meaningless
He tolerates sin in Hell which surely is in his midst as well  Also
given that he is allknowing he must have eternal knowledge of who
will commit which sins as well as when and where so what does
tolerance have to do with anything  All of this is absolute nonsense
unless your god is not indeed allknowing and allpowerful or unless
he doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you
claim

And the Israelites knew this  And
still some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed  Were these
people KIND and LOVing themselves  

Not relevant  The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in
reference to your god  The nature of his creationsvictims is not at
issue

God gave them every break He could but in the end He really had no
choice in the matter  

I see an allknowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome
would be and an allpowerful god who had no choice in the matter
Mindmush

Seeing as how we were failing to achieve salvation on our own He sent
His Son to die for us  to be the ultimate sin offering  

Did I miss something  Did you give some indication at to why a KIND
and LOVING god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his
own botched creations to achieve salvation

 
  Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of
 having made a mistake


He sent His Son as a consolation to us out of love
 
I note that your answer physically follows my question but I fail to
discern a connection between the two

By the way for what am I being consoled

  Now that we are living in the age of grace does this mean that
 for our sins God now damns us to eternal hell after we die rather
 than killing us immediately  If so is this eternal damnation an
 example of A KIND and LOVING God


Hey let's be fair for a moment here  KIND and LOVING does not mean
a free ride 

Why not  By the way I note for the record that you didn't answer the
questions 

There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship
Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that 
children can do whatever they want  NOT  Part of being a parent means
administering punishment when the child is at fault  

Death andor eternal damnation is your idea of correctional
punishment  I hope you aren't a parent

Part of being a parent means giving instruction  God tests us through
the trial of life such that we may grow stronger  He teaches what is
right and what is wrong  

This is quite an elaborate fantasy that you've constructed but sadly
it lacks a basis in reality  It also does not address the questions
that I raised

The consequences of our actions are made clear to us be it Heaven or
be it Hell  If God did not follow through with what He has warned us
about He would not be a very good parent

The god that you describe is not a good parent but a tyrant

In parenting if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through
with it the children will not take that parent's words very seriously
God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and
what not to do  By life's trials we see the folly of doing our own
will rather than His  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting
Him when it comes time for Judgement  

Sorry was that the god of the Bible whose rules I am to follow or
the god of the Koran  The Vedas  The Book of Koresh  Oh yes it's
all so clear

Do we follow Him

I will

    pretty good idea who it is

c One of them is wrong but we never have any information as to who so
    we make our best guess if we really must make a decision

d The idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless implying that
     whether peace is better than war eg is a meaningless question
     and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer

e Something else  A short positive assertion would be nice

e d is close but misses the point that there is a third party
with their own subjective viewpoint asked to make a decision  Peace
is not better than war unless we view the situation subjectively as
humans  Of course we are humans and so do view situations from
our own perspective so it is meaningful for us to discuss questions
of war and peace

condemning his own religion  After all isn't it a cult too 

 bad thoughts these

  well it depends on whether you take the literal dictionary definition of
cult and say all faiths are cults or if you take a more socialcontext
view of cult which allows you to recognize mainstream religions as 
sociallyacceptable and cults as groups that involve techniques of brain
washing and all the other characteristics that define oppressive probly not
the best word cult behaviour

My understanding of the academic use of the word cult is that it is
a group of people oriented around a single authority figure It need
not be religious However I have seen plenty of religious cults
including some that mainstream

 How could striving toward an ideal be in any way useful if the ideal 
 had no objective existence
 
A perfectly efficient power station would convert all of the energy in coal
into electricity  There is absolutely no way we can build a perfect power
station it's an ideal  But striving towards that ideal is undeniably
useful and valuable is it not
 
 OK let me narrow the question Is it useful to strive toward a
 nonexistent objective ethics

I'd guess that it might be

 In what way

It may be the case that some people are unable to evaluate complex moral
issues  Rather than leaving them to behave immorally it might be better
to offer them an abstract nonexistent objective system of ethics which they
can strive towards coded into rules which they don't have to derive for
themselves

I tend to feel that this is pretty much what we all have as morality
anyway

Then we all live happily ever after 

Seriously if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in I suspect we'd all
agree on the best course of action  Unfortunately I have no confidence that
such a situation will ever arise 

Some of us think there's a big God in the sky some don't  Some think
they've been chosen by God others disagree  Some think they are infallible
others think otherwise  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be
ironed out there's little hope of everyone agreeing

     Or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame
 of reference in which thus and such is good isn't that approximately
 objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to
 outrun a snail

Yes  I think that for example only a vanishingly small number of people
would hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million
Jews is good  So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value
as I've encountered in my life so far

                       For example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area
 isn't it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even
 though there conceivably might be some tailend case that would justify it

Well I think your example's poor  If the bomb's in Iraq for example and
was dropped by an American plane many people would hold that it was a moral
act

   And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
   it isn't an objective reality for values
  
  I'm sorry I can't parse an objective reality for values  Could you tr
 y
  again
  
  san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face
  of disagreement
 
 I still don't quite see what you're trying to say  I assume by values you
 mean moral values yes  In which case what do you mean by real  What is
 a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one
 
 I mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand
 by a horse being real is pretty much what I mean about a value being real

Hmm  So these moral values have a perceptible physical presence

  If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in
  your opinion then all you get is infinite regress
 
 Sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  It looks extremely finite
 to me
 
 I meant that it's never more than your opinion

Right and the chain ends right there  The buck stops with me  It's not an
infinite regress

                                                       You've clarified this
 for me above  My understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists
 agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference
 then they're saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes
 no different than what I'm saying

Right  The key point however is that there are vanishingly few of these
moral issues where we can get  of people to agree on the outcome for all
frames of reference and agree on the frames of reference

                                                     What you do not get
  is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
  is inferior to that of the man of peace
 
 Sorry but that's not so  I can provide a justification for asserting that
 the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace  
 I just can't provide a justification which works in all possible
 circumstances
 
 Logically possible or actually possible

I can't manage either  Killing Hitler using a car bomb would have been a
terrorist act but I have to admit that I couldn't exactly condemn it 
Although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight

                                              By which I mean are you
 stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal
 switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you
 think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is
 superior to peace

I think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have
been better than peace  Better in terms of numbers of innocent people
killed  Assuming it was successful terrorism of course

  Specifically I'd like to know what relativism concludes when two
  people grotesquely disagree  Is it
  
  a Both are right
  
  b One of them is wrong and sometimes though perhaps rarely we have a 
      pretty good idea who it is
  
  c One of them is wrong but we never have any information as to who so
      we make our best guess if we really must make a decision
  
  d The idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless implying that
       whether peace is better than war eg is a meaningless question
       and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer
  
  e Something else  A short positive assertion would be nice
 
 From whose point of view would you like to know what relativism concludes 
 One of the people involved in the argument or some third person observing
 the arguers
 
 I've just come from responding another of your posts where some pennies
 have dropped for me  But it would clarify further if you would answer
 from the point of view of any disinterested observers  perhaps an
 observer as likely to be in position A as in position B where A and B
 disagree in the future and have his or her conclusion now binding on
 them at that time

Well if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's and if he
agrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences
regarding the situation then I would expect him to conclude that there is no
right answer  Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow
him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept

If on the other hand he disagrees with the principles of either A or B I
suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one

It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from
all perspectives  For instance I am completely unable to come to any
conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not from my
perspective  In an ideal world all living things would have a right to
life but in an ideal world women would have the absolute right to do what
they like with their own bodies  Clearly there is no way to resolve in
favour of both these principles  Therefore I agree with the compromise
solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception and
deciding on the time based on various sometimes illdefined criteria  This
is also a sensible move I think because it lets people make their own
decisions within reason  And for what it's worth I am reasonably happy
with current UK abortion law

Similarly the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess and
I really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion  There I don't even
know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage

 Question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists Stephen
 Tice the Cotera Joe Gaut et alapologies if I've mislabelled any
 of you I've only started reading trm since the BD disaster  But I
 know the Cotera is a fundy and are defending Koresh and his beliefs
 as an example of True Christianity under persecution from the the Big
 Bad Secular State what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits
 If the reports are accurate what IYO does this say about the quality of
 his Christianity  Or are the allegations just part of the Big
 CoverUp

Thank you Steve  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
a Christian  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
conviction  I am not certain what you mean by the fundy part as the
term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses  If you refer to

I use it to refer to those Christians who take a more
conservativeliteralist approach to the Bible as distinct from
liberals

those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and
wish to follow in his way then I plead guilty  But what does it

I would use the word Christian unqualified to describe someone to
whom the above definition applied  BTW it applies to me

deletia Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a
civil liberties issue not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs
andor practices

I agree with Joe about this if some group wants to believe in
whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together
and have group sex or no sex or sex only for the leaders but NOT
with children then as much as I might believe them to be misguided
I think they should have the legal right  And I hope the
investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any
legitimate reason for going after Koresh in the first place before
moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used

Joe goes on to dispute the childabuse allegations  I'll
provisionally accept this unless someone has evidence to support
the allegations

Actually I wasn't thinking about the alleged child abuse but about
the reports that he had sex with and fathered children by several
women in the cult  I agree this is not a legal matter  consenting
adults and all that  but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's
beliefs and practices from specifically Christian perspective not a
civil liberties perspective  

I think my question is not really aimed at Joe and possibly not at
Ray Cote either who seems to also be taking the political angle but
at Stephen Tice

Omigod it's an operationalist Sorry Jim but the idea that a theory
explaining a myriad of distinctly different observations is merely a
model is more than sensible people can accept  your phobia about
objective reality notwithstanding

First of all I have no phobia of objective reality  I'm simply
saying that the scientific model of the atom is probably not 
what is really out there  I'm not saying that there's no object
that sources these properties we measure from atomic theory

You hadn't made that clear I'm glad to have it clarified So you're
a physical objectivist after all right

Take light as another example  There are two theories particle and
wave  Each one fails to predict the behavior of light as some point
So which is it particle or wave  You tell me  You're the sensible
one

I think you have been engaging in the fallacy of false dichotomy you have
consistently characterized sciencereligion as rationalismnonsense when
in fact the latter do not form a complete set of options  Neither do the
former for that matter

   I wish that the semiexplicit linking of evolution to socalled rational

oftenrepeated incantation that evolution leads to atheism

No Dave and as an anthropologist I take great umbrage with this 
misrepresentation  I sense that it is you that has made the jump from creation
science to religion see above  I have characterized sciencecreation 
science as rationalismnonsense and that it is  When people promote their 
religious beliefs as science they become nonsense  Kept where they belong 
they are meaningful and useful as virtually any anthropologists will tell you
and as I have said several times in this group  And it works the other way 
too and I have repeatedly said so  Never have I said or meant anything 
different here or elsewhere and I don't think my communication skills betray
me  Nor do I presume to offend people's spiritual sensibilities as
I would hope others would not disparage mine

  I saw one theist on this net talking about the absurdity of one saying he
doesn't believe in god and how can we be sure  The problem with this and
other arguments assumes that the burden of proof lies with the atheist Wrong
In philosophy the one who is making a positive argument must give reasons for
his believing so not the negative  If I were to make the statement elves 
exist then it would be up to me to prove my positive assertion not the 
person saying that elves don't exist  If the negative in this case had to 
prove elves don't exist he would have to omniscient and know every inch of the
universe  The same applies with god  Give me your reasons and you the theist make the case

I think you have are addressing the wrong issue The situation
is more like we both see some elves This is established as
fact since we can both touch them etc Then one of us says the
elves have always been with us The other says no no there was
a time before elves were here Which is the positive argument

  There's no objective physics Einstein and Bohr have told us that
 Speaking as one who knows relativity and quantum mechanics I say 
 Bullshit
Speaking as someone who also knows relativity and quantum mechanics I say
Go ahead punk make my day  My degree can beat up your degree

Simple  Take out some physics books and start looking for statements which
say that there is no objective physics  I doubt you will find any  You might
find statements that there is no objective length or no objective location
but no objective physics  Consider for instance that speedoflightin
vacuum is invariant  This sounds an awful lot like an objective
speedoflightinvacuum

Or you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor  If you take
a look at Quantum Mechanics many objective observations can be made
as well  However Physics is not objective  Bohr said the randomness
of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself  Einstein said that 
nature is deterministic it is our method of observation that inserts the
randomness  They were talking about the exact same results

But neither of them claimed to have experimental evidence that proved 
them right In a similar vein there is as yet no experimental evidence
for supersymmetric particles so some physicists believe in them and
some don't  but all agree that either there is an objectively true
answer to the question

Depends on how you look at it I guess

Joakim Ruud joakimrifiuiono writes

Recently I've asked myself a rather interesting question What RIGHT does
god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of course 

In his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
according to his rules we will burn in hell Well with what RIGHT can god
make that desicion Let's say for the sake of argument that god creates
every one of us directly or indirectly it doesn't matter What then
happens is that he first creates us and then turns us lose Well I didn't
ask to be created

Let's make an analogue If a scientist creates a unique living creature
which has happened it was even patented does he then have the
right to expect it to behave in a certain matter or die

Dear Joakim let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions
but that by asking you will find as many different explanations as there
are respondents  As a Latterday Saint I believe that all of us you
me etc lived once as spiritchildren of God the Father Hebrews 
in the premortal existance In order to continue our eternal progression
an earthly probationary time was required  To live by faith not by
sight to choose good over evil and to prepare ourselves in all things
to become worthy of a higher order of existance  We believe that all of
God's spiritoffspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of
this earthly sojourn  Onethird chose for Lucifer's plan most followed
the Firstborn the premortal Jesus Christ  Lucifer's aspirations I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God    Isaiah  etc
resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and
those who followed Him resulting in the casting out of Lucifer who
became Satan the father of lies and onethird of the hosts of heaven
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast
them to the earth    Revelation  as demons evil spirits

To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth and to be subject to
God and His plan for good or bad based upon our obedience and choices
we made that choice individually  God speaking to Job Where wast thou
when I laid the foundations of the earth    when the morning stars
sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy Job   We
lost the knowledge of our premortal existance the Veil of Forgetful
ness somewhere in Psalms in order to live by faith not by sight

You may not accept this scenario neither do quite a few who rely on the
Bible alone which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular
aspect of our existence as individuals as sons and daughters of God

Who is god to impose its rules on us  Who can tell if god is REALLY so
righteous as god likes us to believe Are all christians a flock of sheep
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm

All Christians by definition ARE a flock of sheep following the Shepherd
as they understand Him    But in any event not all Christians believe
in the same theology such as the one Latterday Saints believe in  They
will cry heresy and other accusations of perverting the doctrines of
the Bible while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations as
found in their catechisms and various doityourself Biblestudy manuals

As for me I have a personal conviction that the preexistance scenario as
explained above is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine some Dead Sea
Scroll books the pseudographion other Jewish sources and last but not
least modernday revelation on the subject

I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm I mean it

                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that
                        he is acting according to God's will and who there
     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by
                        stabbing you in the back

 Well I can cut to the chase and admit that what I find least attractive 
 about realtivism is that it elevates the heinous to the level of the good 
 by saying in effect to each his own or what's good for you  isn't good
 for me  Thus the terrorist is elevated to the same level as the man
 of peace

So then I assume that you feel that there is an objective definition for
terrorist

 Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people
 of the US collectively  for all of the land in America would that 
 sound like a good deal  
 
 That happens to be a subjective example that the people of the
 US would happen to agree on  Continue to move the price up 
 at some point a few people would accept then more then more until 
 probably all would accept at a high enough number
 
 And this high enough number is  
 
 My point is that the deal is bad and pretty much anyone can see it is so

Really  I suspect my neighbor would jump at your deal

Of course she's only three but if it were objectively bad you wouldn't
think it would make a difference

Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus  I realize it is normally tossed
out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons

 It is not tossed out as a source but would it be regarded as
unbiased and independant 

Bruce hits the main point simply  as Russell Turpin does in more detail
in his response  All sources are in modern historiography to be used
critically which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them are
subject to specific examination in the light of motives and other HUMAN
considerations as well as the physical background  The critical method
applies BOTH to the original document AND to the uses made of it by others
most emphatically including the historical researchers themselves

wouldn't they be a better reporter than someone who heard about it second 
hand  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand  I know there is bias
and winners writing history but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best
still apply

But given the critical principle what evidence is there that we have
ANYTHING at ALL from firsthand sources about Jesus  Paul's letters are
indeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions  They are as
a result the most historically solid books in the NT  Paul's claims and
descriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be wie es eigent
lich gewesen  but they are most definitely the comments of a participant
In other words we'd evaluate Paul's statements more or less as we would
the testimony of a witness in court

The gospels are another story altogether  Luke is most assuredly NOT a
firsthand witness  He claims to have gathered material that is closer
to the actual events  but this is a conventional claim in ancient books
and Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in his
books which derive from any source we can detect behind Luke  John
has a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloved
disciple who is NOT named  We are not bound to accept this claim for
a long time some scholars rejected it outright but even if we do it
makes the fourth gospel as we have it at best secondhand  Neither Mark
nor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand  Later much later Christian
tradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaic
protogospel and associates Mark with Peter as having something like the
same secondhand status of recounting Peter's preaching of the gospel

Such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate the
actual data before us  Luke and Matthew both appear to use differently
an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of logoi words and
deeds of Jesus as well as to be dependent on Mark  This makes their
testimony AT LEAST thirdhand

All that said historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from the
NT sources and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources for
anything about the earliest Church  They are also extremely important
for the light they cast however refracted through Christian biases on
the sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of the
destruction of the nd Temple

The problem of the historical Jesus is tricky however  There is a
cycle of fashion on this and we are now near a major high in people
thinking they can discern with historicocritical plausibility some
thing about Jesus' life and opinions from the NT  The difficulty here
which dominated thinking  years ago and will probably return to favor
in another generation  was pointed out by Bultmann after Schweitzer's
treatment at the end of the previous highpoint on the cycle  simply
BECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quite
anonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church we have no easy and reliable
way to distribute ANY part of the material between real history and the
inventions of the Church  There are few radical skeptics who think we
have nothing of history in the gospels though such a position can be
maintained but neither have we any tools that can distinguish shaping
of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to invention

Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use
the net as its major recruitment medium  Therefore even if this
religion does not take off its founding members will be very important
historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become 
common

The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional
morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's
accounts of the facts and historical events is correct

For example

Story of Adam and Eve
Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant  Have unlimited
supply of food provided but no clothing jobs or knowledge  God says
not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge  They do anyway then try to hide 
in bushes  God finds them and forces them out of Garden
There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in
the bushes that might have angered God

Traditional Philosophy
 The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat  If someone else will
provide you with food then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK This
is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades
 Authority figures such as God whoever was behind the Vietnam War Hitler 
and slaveowners are always right and should be blindly followed without 
question by ordinary people who can't make decisions for themselves

Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy
They were not supposed to eat the fruit  They should have done whatever God
told them to  Like small children they had their needs provided for and were
obligated to do whatever their Father said to  Being forced to leave the 
Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment

Lessons from Traditional Interpretation
  Ignorance is good  Knowledge is bad but tempting
  Having food provided for you for nothing read welfare is ideal  Get
ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment
  Public nudity is good  Covering up is bad
  Authority figures are intrinsically right  Normal people are dumb and 
should do whatever they are told without question  They should not think for 
themselves
  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from
learning  For example it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read

's philosophy
  People should seek education and employment outside the home unless
named Hillary Clinton or Murphy Brown
  People should use common sense  They should not kill other people 
binding of Issac wars Holocaust etc just because they are told to

Interpretation of events based on current philosophy
They were supposed to eat the fruit  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge
rather than be handed it on a silver platter  Once they had gained knowledge
and by seeking it showed their ability to make mature decisions for them
selves they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were 
REWARDED by being allowed into the real world

Lessons from new interpretation
  Ignorance is bad  Knowledge is good but must be sought
  Having food provided for you for nothing read welfare is at best
a temporary measure  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn
is ideal
  Public nudity is bad  Covering up is good
  Authority figures are often wrong  Normal people are intelligent and
should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and alter
or abolish bad governments  They should think for themselves
  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge
but should seek it anyway and all the harder  For example poor children 
without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better
life for their children and themselves

I have tentatively named this new philosophy The Church of Eveism because
Eve's decision to eat the apple is mansickind's first good decision instead
of its first bad one as traditionally believed  She is therefore clearly
a protagonist  God at first appears evil for telling people not to seek 
knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist  As God rewarded the
decision to defy him and provided the tree in the first place the intention
and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained but to delay it 
until it was actively sought

End serious discussion  Begin humor

Save this post to disk or file server  Someday it will be considered the
most important writing since the  Commandments  You want an original copy

Stay tuned for the RFD on socreligioneveism
Can I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization

     Barclay's claims are bogus McKenzie's arguements are a sham
Oehler position is specious Jouon's ideas are fiction Darby is a

AhhaNow with the Branch Athiests zealots we have the following

     Hitchings claims are bogus Gorman argument's are a sham
Jastrow's position is specious Stanley's ideas are fiction Durant
is a fraud Thorpe is a counterfeit Hoyle's claims are vapid

Are we witnessing the founding of a new major religion or has
it really been there all along


Let me try again

The doubt that has infiltrated the previous smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology has inflamed passions  There is lack of agreement
even within warring camps  Sometimes it seems as if there are as many 
variations on each evolutionary theme as there are individual biologists

Niles Eldridge yes he's a paleontologist Natural History Evolutionary
Housecleaning Feb  pg 

Jack

Ooooops  Jack you forgot to expunge one part of your new rippedoutofcontext
quote  That's the last line  Here Eldridge is talking about disagreement over
the various theories themes  We all know about that  We also know that
nobody in the warring camps doubts the fact of evolution  You see if you
had clipped the last line you could have made it look like even evolutionary
biologists are doubting the fact of evolution  That's what you wanted to do 
isn't it  Boy oh boy do you need to sharpen up your quote clippers or what

By the way what's an anthropological parallel

Brian Kendig first states

 I am my own master

I ask

 Are you truly the master of yourself

Brian Kendig states

 Not yet   

Make up your mind 

     but my life is the ground I use to practice on  The fun is
 in the getting there We don't start out perfect    

And we do not end perfect either  We are never perfect  Can you name
one person young or old past or present that you deem perfect 
Good luck

 I know my shortcomings and I know my strengths and I live
 my life according to the decisions I make and I am content to abide
 with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the
 praise for them  There have been times in my life when I've made
 mistakes yes I try to never make the same mistake twice

Then you lie to yourself  You do not know your shortcomings  I have clearly
shown one of your shortcomings if not two  That is ignorance of the Bible
and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its 
contents

 I regard Christ as a myth 

Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself
And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion I bet you do not
even know what the word Christ means  Or which prophet used Christ to 
describe the Son of Man 

 I feel that there are far too many people
 offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
 did  The only person who can really judge me is me

Yes  I agree with that  So we must learn first  Read the Bible  Come
up with our own interpretation   Evaluate what is being said
and by whom  Check the history books as well  Compare someone else's
interpretation with your own  Then make a judgment  But I tell you the
truth  of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as 
much as a coffee cup needs interpretation

And remember the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics  
It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said    The 
Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed 
to people like you and I  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard  Is it 
their open diaryand they want to tell you something  And because they
want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to
know   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric but in simple
straightforward language

 I choose the
 roads I travel and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of
 any given road or turn back  and as long as I don't always turn
 back there's no shame in it  When I need help I seek out my friends

You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible  You have chosen the
road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that
road doesn't look appealing to you  You rather build your own road  One
that goes far away from that confrontation   But be assured of this
you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly 

And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying either  Open your
eyes and SEE open your ears and LISTEN  I'm not just spouting off
empty words  This is my LIFE this is what gives me MEANING

I see what you mean  I hear what your saying  I am not degrading your
life  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years  There is nothing 
new in what you are saying  And by your own words you are spouting off 
contradictions   If contradictions give you meaning then your life must
be sad

 I say my mother loves me  How do I know you ask  I can point to
 definite things she's done for me and I can even just bring her to
 you so you can ask her facetoface
 You say your deity loves you  How do you know I ask 

Bingo  For God so loved the world he GAVE his only begotton to son
so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life   I look
what God did  He has given his Son even to his death so that I can have 
hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing but has
glorious purpose

 You can't even convince me that it exists 

Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history  You choose to
lie to yourself that he doesn't exist for you ignore what has been said for 
thousands of years  You sound exactly almost verbatim like the Lazarus of 
Jesus's story starting in Luke   And the conclusion of that story is a 
bleak one  Lazarus wound up in hell  The story ends like this

      For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets
       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead

 If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot promising untold
 pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
 rationality for just this once then I would choose 'hell'  I can
 not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful
 it is

Arrogance at its best   The fact is you are not rational  Several specific
cases  have already been cited   And again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regards to heaven  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect
in heaven  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him  Jesus does
not expect you to placate either  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him but not
as his grovelling slave but rather as his brother who will share in his
glorious riches  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself  
You maintain you have an open mind  See whether you are lying to yourself for
yourself

Why would you want to live a good life
To you you die and that's it  Don't contradict yourself  You have
no reason to live a good life  It doesn't do you any good in the
end  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway  So you have no reason to lead a good life Leading
a good life is meaningless   Why do you do such a meaningless thing

That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word
I've said

I do understand what you said   But that's is not what I feel went amiss here

You missed the point  Living a good life has no eternal consequences
Once they close the amusement park of life to you that is the end  To you it 
is over  To you therefore your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless 
It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth 

But then you contradict yourself  From a previous post you said doing evil things 
is bad  To you it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things  It is
all meaningless in the end anyway  So go rob a bank  Go tell someone
you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag  What's restraining you
Life after all has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant

 In the same way I think life is fun  And I don't intend to leave the
 amusement park of life until they close down for the night  D

At which time you are truly not the master of yourself

I'm sorry I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in
which case it's not really all that important

Has the resurrection sunk in  Jesus is alive  Jesus is NOT dead

So you and your holy book say  By the same token therefore Santa
Claus delivers toys every xmas  Don't you see  I have NO REASON to
believe that what you say is true  Please give me some reason that I
can't similarly apply to Santa Claus

You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses
of Jesus say are true  But you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the
reasons  By definition ignorance 

Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves
and flying reindeer   Ever see a flying reindeer  Has anyone in human
history seen a flying reindeer  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose 
blinks red    

On the other hand are people born in Bethlehem  Was Nebuchandezzar really
a king  Was Daniel really one of his court officials  Were David and Solomon
really kings of Israel and Judah  Was their really a king called Jehoachin
Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem  years before Christ  Did
Sennacherib really lose his battleand badly   Was there really a 
Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus   Yes yes yes    history verifies
it  It is NONFICTION

Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction  Perhaps you
can't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from
that of the Scientific American  I suppose you treat both with equal
truthfulness or equal falsity  Is this what you are telling me  Or
is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out
that it's not a fairy tale

Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without
invoking them

Get real  Have you ever been to Zaire  Do you have to go there
to be  assured that there really is such a place  Given your 
irrationality I take it you have never used a map in your life

 Why do you believe what you believe

Given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living
God I'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didn't follow Jesus

          HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives about  accurate the 
          subconscious mind can sometimes make things up especially

          SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including 
          Matthew  John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of 
          Elias and John  How can a person POSSIBLY sin before 
          he is born unless he LIVED BEFORE 
          
               Strong INTERESTS innate TALENTS strong PHOBIAS etc 
          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES  For example 
          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually 
          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE  
          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to 
          another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT 
          life because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS 
          INCARNATION 

               People would behave much better toward each other if 
          they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be 
          reaped by them in the future or in a FUTURE INCARNATION

Sorry the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called AMORC 
I don't remember for the time being what the AM stand for
but ORC is Ordo Rosae Crucis in other words latin for
Order of the Rose Cross Sigh seems l'm loosing more and more
of my long term memory

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent
metaphysical bookstore if any of you are interested in such books
And my son loves to run around in their Egyptian museum

 don't think that homosexuals should be hung by their toenails  
 
 If you want to discuss bible thumpers you would be better off singling
 out and making obtuse generalizations about Fundamentalists  If you
 compared the actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern 
 Baptists you would think that they were different religions
 
Sarcasm on
Be sure we pick on the correct groups here  Bible thumpers
fundamentalists and Southern Baptists deserve our hasty generalizations
and prejudicial statements  Just don't pick on the Presbyterians
and the Methodists
Sarcasm off 
 Please prejudice is about thinking that all people of a group are the

have to take part  What other reason is there for an organized moment
of silence

A moment of silence doesn't mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise it's not silent now is it

The whole point is maybe everyone doesn't want to participate


Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is

trajancwisunomahaedu Stephen McIntyre writes

 It usually all has to do with how the child is
      brought up  From the time he is born the
      theist is brought up with the notion of the
      truth of some kind of scripture the Bible
      the Torah the Qur'an  etc  He is told
      of this wondrous God who wrote or inspired
      the scripture of the prophets talked about in
      the scripture of the miracles performed  etc
      He is also told that to question this as
      children are apt to do is a sin a crime
      against God and to lose belief in the scrip
      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell
      Thus by the time he is able to read the
      scripture for himself the belief in its truth
      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
      matter of course

You're missing something here  There are people who convert from
nontheism to theism after being brought up in a nontheist household  I
don't have any statistics as to how many though  That would be an
interesting thing to know  

Well I was raised as an athiest and eventually took on a theistic
view However I try to be a rationalist as well as a theist Anyhow
I will try to make some comments on your observations just to 
contribute some datapoints from a different perspective

I think that religion is a crutch  People are
naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable  People don't want
to believe that when they die they are dead finished  That there is
nothing else after that  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy

Religion can be a crutch Before going much further on that thread
I would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of world
religions out there though There are athiestic religions as well as
theistic religions There are religions that claim knowledge about
such things as an afterlife and there are religions that make no such
claims 

My perspective is that lots of people talk but all that means is that
talk is cheap When someone gives me substantial evidence about an
afterlife then I'll start believing in one In the mean while my
religion deals with what we know exists that is life here and now

Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe things
science has not yet described and it also gives people a feeling of
security that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok

Again some religions do and others do not Some religions teach people
that life is chaotic and to accept it for what it is

That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions  This
has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these
people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their
belief system for what it gains them  This is why I think it's kind of
useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism  They are happy with
their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too
they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept
the harsh reality that they are running from

I'll tell you that I moved from an athiestic perspective to a theistic
one because I believe that I observed phenomenon that was better 
explained from the theistic perspective while the athiestic perspective
could not explain it However that does not mean that I'm willing to
accept a lot of fourth hand gobblygook that contridicts modern science
along with my theistic perspective

 
                      Atheist
                            Libertarian
                    Proindividuality
                                Proresponsibility

 This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolut
 standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality
 are equally good
 
 Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than
 others

False  Not stating X is not equivalent to stating not x

 How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of
 reference

There is no objective way of measuring the goodness' of a moral
system  It's a value judgement  Therefore there is so objective
comparison for moral systems  Therefore there is no best' moral
system

 And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
 it isn't an objective reality for values

Similarly there is no frame of reference that can be used to
objectively compare frames of reference  Any such choice is
arbitrary

Which is NOT to say that one should not take up reference frames for
various purposes

There is nothing to believe  not even this statement

Thanks  Am I correct then in assuming that that Josephus

Jack

That is indeed the present consensus  Contrary to what Dr Fox has
been saying however present consensus is not that the longer
passage in Josephus about Jesus was inserted but only that it was
modified
   There is no question that it was at least modified based on what
Origen saysthat Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah but
I don't think the argument that it appears out of context is a very
good one  I haven't looked at the context for a while perhaps somebody
could give some of the sentences which precede and follow the Jesus
passage

I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day
Furthermore we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending
potentially dangerous and armed suspects  Do you suggest that the police
always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have
been allowed to inspect the officers's badges  Just what should the police do
when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects  How far can they
reasonably go to identiy themselves  What do you suggest they can do which
can't be faked by the competition

So instead you are asking individual citizens to place themselves at risk
by assuming that everyone who claims to be a cop actually is a cop
Around here the police have actually made public service announcements saying
that if you are a lady driving by yourself at night and you see blue lights
flashing behind you Do not pull over until you reach a well lit preferably
occupied place gas station etc

Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops that's not an
excuse to murder police

It wouldn't be murder it would be self defense

 In my mind to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
 reach Science has its basis in observable fact 

I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is
interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on
the values of the observer Science is a human activity and as such
is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human
activity The myth that scientists are above moral influence or
ethical concern that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure
from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist is nonsense

Bill

 If one is to argue for objective values in a moral sense then one must
 first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective Considering
 the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen

 So back to the original question

 And objective morality is

This may be an unfortunate choice of words almost selfcontradictory
Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and
absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of
people The first term is all inclusive the second is specific The
concept supposedly described may have meaning however 
If there is a God as described by the Christians for instance then
He has existence apart from and independent of humankind His
existence is outside of our frame of reference reality If this
being declares a thing to be so it is necessarily so since He has
defined Himself as omnipotent and if His claims are to be believed
He is at least omnipotent relative to us God is intrinsically
selfdefined and all reality is whatever He says it is  in an
objective sense
If God determines a standard of conduct that standard is objective
If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
standard while permitted to ignore it they substitute a relative
morality or mode of conduct giving the term morality a nebulous
meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
misunderstand The standard is objective and the conduct required to
meet that standard is therefore objectively determined
Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
infinitely malleable doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
doesn't exist Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
norm or the preferred conduct of decent people making it seem
subjective but it is derived from an absolute objective standard
Ironically this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
nature according to Christianity at least yet is condemned as being
contrary to human nre oppressive and severe This may be due as

Bill
much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself but like it
or not it's therex

When the right to freedom of speech was invented all we had to worry about
was printing presses and live speech Now we have to worry about violent movies
influencing the young and tv beaming pornography into homes Do you really believe we should start restricting constitutionally guaranteed freedoms because

For those who think David Koresh didn't have a solid structure

I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon  

Other than it tells quite a lot about the Man himself 
                                             
I'm curious  Are you referring to Koresh as the Man  Why the 
upper case M                           
                                                         

It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most people

Are you the spokesman for most people
                                                          
I never claimed to be a spokesman for most people  It is an assumption
on my part that people with normal values and morality would be more 
concerned with human life than sermon structure  
                                      

You missed the point  which is that the Prophets the Psalms and 
Revelation all together provide a very rich view of a very special
event  a wedding                        
                        
                     
Are burning children part of this very special event      
                                          

	                        
My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord are
human and imperfect Whatever we preach no matter how eloquent or
how corrupted  is of little difference Those who know the Master's
voice will recognize Him  a gemstone amidst rock Such is also the 
lesson of the stumblingblock For those who have an ear to hear 	
                                                
What about those who do not know the Master's voice  Does the Master
not care about them  Eloquent but corrupt preaching may be of little
difference to you  But I suspect it made a big difference to all of
those who died in the compound

    Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned

 for the fire and the destruction of the people  All you have done is
 put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
 up your claim that the FBI was responsible

Last night CNN reported that FBI has infrared pictures showing
that the fires started in three places at the same time That 
would indicate something not resembling an accident

 Eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting
 God  If you choose to jump off a cliff you can hardly blame God for you 
 going splat at the bottom  He knows that if you choose to jump that 
 you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice  In fact
 He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what
 lies below  To prove that point Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being
 God was able to rise up again  I have seen the example of Christ and have 
 chosen not to jump and I'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you'll 
 go splat
  
 You don't have to listen to me and I won't stop you if you decide to jump
 I only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge  You owe it to
 yourself  I don't like seeing anyone go splat

I'm for the moment interested in this notion of the 'leap of faith'
established by Kierkegaard It clearly points out a possible solution
to transcendental values What I don't understand is that it also
clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any
transcendental direction is equal 

In other words I might not jump off the cliff mentioned above
but at the same time I will decide to what direction I will go
Actually I will do it just now

  Is there some relation between the name 'Cybele' and the phenemenon of the
  'sibyl'  Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be

The OED gives the etymology of sibyl as coming from the ancient Greek 

	sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha 
	 S i b ih l l a 

which is claimed to come from the Doric 

	sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha 
	 s i o b ih l l a 

which if I read it properly in turn came from the Attican Athenian

	theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta 
	 th eh o b o ih l ae 

I don't know much about Attis but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that
this God was tied to the Athenian capital

	Alpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma
	a t t i k u s

The OED does not list any etymology for Cybele since that is a propper noun
but I suggest that the Greek spelling of that word would be much closer to
the anticedants of Sibyl than the two words are now Perhaps Cybele is a
French or Latin spelling

Pope Charles writes

Rhoemer was the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniforms 
and props used by the early Nazis in their rallies and such

The name is Roehm not Rhoemer  And Hitler does claim that he came up
with the Swastika business

But didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member  some dentist or
other I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf

He was killed in an early Nazi purge He and many of his associates
were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant orgies

I have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this
common assertion recently  Postings to such groups as sochistory and
socculturegerman has not uncovered any netexperts who could provide
any 

Well I'm no expert but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this They
make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the
long knives The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of
the SA was common knowledge Also a book by a homosexual author whose name
escapes me at the moment called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehm
and Heines were homosexuals as well as others in Roehm's SA circle

All the books say that Roehm and his associate Edmund Heines
were homosexual  I have been able to find nothing beyond that and
suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend 

Well you're the one who is in Germany If you don't believe the history books
look up the primary sources yourself Those of us outside of Germany do not
have access to these You do It seems to me that there were plenty of
documented instances  several scandals the fact that on the knight of the
long knives several SA members including Heines were found sleeping
together etc Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's
homosexual activities seducing young boys etc The histories that I've 
read make a very convincing case None of this sounds like urban legend to me 

Irving a
notoriously unreliable historian says that Funk the Nazi finance
minister was homosexual  He gives no sources

I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk What precisely do
you know that would contradict all of the other history books that I have
read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis Are you trying to say that 
all historians are taking part in an antihomosexual smear What about 
homosexual writers who agree with the official history Don't you think they 
would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals
I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism No one 
should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case 

I challenge anyone to document this claim

If you are going to challenge all historians on this point not just Irving
then the burden of proof is on you Track down the references Find out where
the stories originate from Again you are the one in Germany close to
archival material  most people on the net are not

I have found a great
deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the
Nazis  This seems to include all of the worst onesHitler Himmler
Goebbels Goering Heydrich Eichmann and many more

Eh What is your agenda here To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals so
that you can bash heterosexuals Does it bother you that some of the Nazis
might have been homosexuals Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is
true Of course not And what about bisexuals Are they halfNazis

I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were
homosexuals The German officer corps before WW for instance was notorious
for its homosexuality There were numerous scandals which rocked the German
govt during the late th and early th century Many of the Kaiser's friends
were prosecuted  the Kaiser was no homosexual but the Germany army had a long
tradition of tolerating homosexuality going far back into Prussian history 
back to Frederick the Great at least who was himself a homosexual Roehm was a 
product of this Prussian officer tradition and the old German army like the
English public school system being a well known center of homosexuality
would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality

In addition some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth The
Hitler Youth swallowed up all preNazi youth groups and some of the various 
prewar Vandervogel Bund and Volkish youth groups were known to promote 
homoerotic ideals and friendship and in many cases homosexuality itself So 
it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis 
regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the evils of homosexuality
Why should this suprise anyone Homosexuality has always existed in all 
societies  it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception

No I don't have any sources for you as I think the only kind of proof you
will accept would be citations from archival material and I do not have access 
to these Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern
homosexuality that I have ever read  I don't have the time Nothing is
stopping you however from chasing down those sources Until you prove
otherwise though I will stick with the established histories

Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating
that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter or we must
discount every other book of antiquity

 Peter died two millenia ago  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust  If he were alive today and I could
 
 Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great Tilgrath Pilisar III
 Nero Caligula Josephus Cyrus the Great Artexerxes   Their documents
 have decayed to dust too  Brian why another excuse 

Mr Ceccarelli you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything
written in every historical document  Somehow I doubt do that yourself
that  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical
document I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith
in the words of the books attributed to Peter 

I shall now give an example of a document from antiquity which I am sure you
reject it dates from the time of Ramses II This was first presented here by
Matthew Wiener  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle and were
carved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals rather
than mere copies  This account records the the battle of Kadesh circa 
BC which occurred on the river Orontes about  miles south of Aleppo 
The Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites and Ramses had his victory
inscribed all over the place  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in
near perfect form  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much
singlehandedly defeated the Hittites after being separated from his troops 

Note that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person 
The following is from Miriam Lichtheims Ancient Egyptian Literature volume
II

	My majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall
	on their faces one upon the other as crocodiles fall into
	the water of the Orontes  I was after them like a griffin
	I attacked all the countries I alone  For my infantry and
	my chariotry had deserted me not one of them stood looking
	back  As I live as Ra loves me as my father Atum favors
	me everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth
	in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry

Note This paragraph records not only Ramses divine word but also that
there were thousands of witnesses to the event  Now from the heart of 
battle

	Then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces
	of the Foe from Hitti being alone by himself none other
	with him  His majesty proceeded to look about him and
	found  chariots ringing him on his way out 

	No officer was with me no charioteer
	No soldier of the army no shieldbearer
	My infantry my chariotry yielded before them
	Not one of them stood firm to fight with them
	His majesty spoke What is this father Amun
	Is it right for a father to ignore his son
	Are my deeds a matter for you to ignore
	Do I not walk and stand at your word
	I have not neglected an order you gave
	Too great is he the great lord of Egypt
	To allow aliens to step on his path
	What are these Asiatics to you O Amun
	The wretches ignorant of god
	Have I not made for you many great monuments
	
	I call to you my father Amun
	I am among a host of strangers
	All countries are arrayed against me
	I am alone there's none with me
	
	The labors of many people are nothing
	Amun is more helpful than they
	I came here by the command of your mouth
	O Amun I have not transgressed your command

	Now though I prayed in a distant land
	My voice resounded in Southern Thebes
	I found Amun came when I called to him
	He gave me his hand and I rejoiced
	He called from behind as if near by
	Forward I am with you
	I your father my hand is with you
	I prevail over a hundred thousand men
	I am lord of victory lover of valor
	I found my heart stout my breast in joy
	All I did succeeded I was like Mont
	
	I slaughtered among them at my will
	Not one looked behind him
	Not one turned around
	Whoever fell down did not rise
	
	One called out to the other saying
	No man is he who is among us
	It is Seth greatofstrength Baal in person
	Not deeds of man are these his doings
	They are of one who is unique
	Who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots
	Come quick flee before him
	To seek life and breathe air
	For he who attempts to get close to him
	His hands all his limbs grow limp
	One cannot hold either bow or spears
	When one sees him come racing along
	My majesty hunted them like a griffin
	I slaughtered among them unceasingly

So you see Brian we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous 
battle between the Ramses and the Hittites  Do you reject them as being
completely true I suspect you do and if so then do you also in your own
words 

    question the existence of Alexander the Great Tilgrath Pilisar III
     Nero Caligula Josephus Cyrus the Great Artexerxes

Do you also thereby question all their documents Thats the problem with your
all or nothing approach  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy
with their facts  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter
and the rest of the New Testament or accept no records of antiquity at all
forces you thereby to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find
completely credible 

As to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus that he
must be true

 Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness 
 Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from
 shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer
 programmers fiction  With a scoff of your keyboard with near
 complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that
 that is all complete hooey   Would that not be the most audacious
 display of arrogance  Do you actually think you know better than
 King Solomon King David or even Abraham Lincoln
 
I have three points  

First this is argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion you
cannot vote on truth  For instance do the millions of Hindu's past and
present who testify to the reality of Brahma constitute actual evidence for
the existence of Brahma How would you answer your own question in regards to
the testimony of Hindus

	With a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of 
	 the testimonies are you going to say that that is all complete 
	 hooey

If you do so scoff then how do you objectively justify your own special
pleading

Second it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to
Jesus  You can claim it to be clear but that does not make it true 

Third it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian and that
he had both a public and a private view of Christianity  In fact there was
much discussion about it in his day yes he was publically accused of being a
deist  Oh my  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've
previously done for Tyre Jefferson and etc 
 
				Later

				Dave Butler

    My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of 
     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become 
     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for 
     thinking I shall ever change them

Because of course that possibility existed  Meaning any student who
really gave a shit could have a moment of silence on hisher own which
makes more sense than forcing those who DON'T want to participate to
have to take part  What other reason is there for an organized moment
of silence

A moment of silence doesn't mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise it's not silent now is it

The whole point is maybe everyone doesn't want to participate

And maybe they do  But without somebody to set the time that doesn't
do them any good



Humph  Deleted there was my list of nonreligious reasons one might
want a moment of silence for a dead classmate

Maybe everyone doesn't want to be silent for teachers to give their
pompous nonreligious speeches in assembly  I know I didn't  So

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it that is
supported by taxpayer money is the only way to keep christianity from
becoming the official US religion

Please provide documentation that opposing only things that are
actively religious eg actual prayer Amen after a moment of
silence mandatory classes in religion and not things that have
possible but uncertain religious implications eg moments of
silence having the Bible on the shelves during reading period is not
a way to prevent a state religion

     The following partial summary of a Theory of the Universe includes a
littleknown description of the CREATION of our Solar System


                      LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics

               Orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists 
          CLAIM to be looking for a Unified Field Theory in which all 
          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single 
          set of laws or equations  But they have been systematically 
          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for  years 

               The late Physicist Dewey B Larson's comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe which he 
          calls the Reciprocal System is built on two fundamental 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of 
          space and time 
    
                The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component MOTION existing in THREE dimensions in DISCRETE 
          UNITS and in two RECIPROCAL forms SPACE and TIME 
    
                The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics its magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN 
    
               From these two postulates Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe using various combinations of 
          translational vibrational rotational and vibrational
          rotational MOTIONS the concepts of INward and OUTward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          which Larson called UNIT VELOCITY and THE NATURAL 
          DATUM 
      
               At each step in the development Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe photons subatomic particles 
          INCOMPLETE ATOMS charges atoms molecules globular star 
          clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white 
          dwarf stars pulsars quasars ETC even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN such as EXPLODING GALAXIES and GAMMARAY 
          BURSTS 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of 
          matter 

               All of this is described in good detail withOUT fancy 
          complex mathematics in his books

          should be available via interlibrary loan if your local 
          university or public library doesn't have each of them 

               Several of them INCLUDING the last one are available 
          from The International Society of Unified Science ISUS 
           E Atkin Ave Salt Lake City Utah    This is the 
          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory  
          They have other related publications including the quarterly 
          journal RECIPROCITY 

          

          Physicist Dewey B Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B Larson was a retired Engineer 
          Chemical or Electrical  He was about  years old when he 
          died in May   He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy PHD degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES  At the same 
          time it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE INCONSISTENCIES ETC 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds etc to experimentally 
          test his Theory  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data  And in 
          many cases HIS explanation FIT BETTER 
    
               A SELFCONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a unified field theory that works but have been 
          IGNORING one for over  years now 
    
               Modern physics does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree  And remember that epicycles crystal spheres 
          geocentricity flat earth theory etc ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG 
    
    
               Prof Frank H Meyer Professor Emeritus of UWSuperior 
          wasis a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory and was or 
          still is President of Larson's organization THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring 
    


          Super Collider BOONDOGGLE
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the Superconducting Super 
          Collider in Texas or anywhere else  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money and contribute almost NOTHING of scientific 
          value 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it but according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B Larson as described in his books the strange GOOFY 
          particles mesons hyperons ALLEGED quarks etc 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders Fermi Lab 
          Cern etc are really just ATOMS of ANTIMATTER which are 
          CREATED by the highenergy colliding beams and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of antimatter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW 
    
               Are a few more types of antimatter atoms worth the  
          BILLION cost  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground 
          cables  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the Supercollider 
    
          
               Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as 
          proposed is TOTALLY ABSURD  If it is built it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST 
      


          LARSONIAN AntiMatter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe antimatter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light 
          which Larson calls Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum 
     
               In Larson's Theory a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER NOT antimatter  When a positron and electron meet 
          the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their 
          respective photons of which they are made neutralize each 
          other 
      
               In Larson's Theory the ANTIMATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of  seconds of arc per century   seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets Venus Earth Jupiter 
          etc  The remaining  seconds of arc are being used to 
          help prove Einstein's General Theory of Relativity 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the  seconds than General Relativity can by 
          INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity  In one or more of his 
          books he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY  He also REJECTED most of Special 
          Relativity including the parts about mass increases near 
          the speed of light and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts Those quasars with redshifts greater than 
           REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time  At low 
          relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE but at high speeds they become significant and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR 
          Larson often used the term COORDINATE TIME when writing 
          about this 
    
     
               In regard to mass increases it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION  FORCE  MASS a  Fm  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR FORCE  In Larson's Theory 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS  
          The expansion of the universe for example is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the socalled Big Bang which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION by Dewey B Larson  North Pacific 
          Publishers PO Box  Portland Oregon    
          pages indexed hardcover 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author an UNrecognized GENIUS more than thirty years ago 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries including the FORMATION of galaxies binary and 
          multiple star systems and solar systems the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma
          ray bursts and the TRUE NATURE of quasars pulsars white 
          dwarfs exploding galaxies etc 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success 
          In his first book in  THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory  And when QUASARS were discovered he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also 
    

 
          GAMMARAY BURSTS

               Astrophysicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMARAY BURSTS  They were 
          originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the 
          disc of our galaxy  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence 
    
               Gammaray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B Larson  According to page  of 
          his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION published in  the 
          gammaray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTIMATTER HALF of the physical universe which Larson calls 
          the Cosmic Sector  Because of the relationship between the 
          antimatter and material halves of the physical universe and 
          the way they are connected together the gammaray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at 
          random  This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects and come from all 
          directions uniformly 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gammaray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth  There would be NO WAY to predict one NOR to 
          stop it 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMARAY BURSTS 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B Larson 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation which is 
          detailed in Chapter  of his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION 
          and in some of his other books 
    
               First of all according to Larson stars do NOT generate 
          energy by fusion  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements heavier than IRON  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT  The heavier the 
          element is the lower is this limit  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process which Larson explains in some 
          of his books better than I can 
    
               When the star explodes the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light because of the high temperature  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while 
    
               Over long periods of time both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions on the HR 
          Diagram 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space making a single lone star 
          again are near zero  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system orbiting each other 
     
               According to Larson a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT is densest at its SURFACE because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed blown 
          outward in time   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter neutron 
          stars black holes etc 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL then instead of a single 
          white dwarf star there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf 
          stars revolving around the red giant star but probably 
          still too far away in threedimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat etc  These will become PLANETS 
      
               In Chapter  of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION Larson used all 
          this information and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law 
          


          Black Hole FANTASY

               I heard that physicist Stephen W Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO black 
          holes merging together into a SINGLE black hole and 
          concluded that the new black hole would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original black holes 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of black 
          holes etc 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe especially his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION it is 
          clear to me that black holes are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES  The strange object at Cygnus X is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR NOT the black 
          hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to prove their theory 
    
    
               By the way I do NOT understand why so much publicity is 
          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking  The physicists and 
          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him wiser  It does NOT 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B Larson while he was still alive  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory books and organization The International Society of 
          Unified Science 
          
          
          
          ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work or how they are constructed 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages  of the book BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B Larson which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe  I quote one paragraph 
    
               As indicated in the preceding chapter the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance  
          The electrons we find are derived from the environment  It 
          was brought out in Volume I Larson's book NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities and that 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are in 
          many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector material half of the 
          universe most of which are uncharged  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space because they are inherently rotating units of space 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion  In open 
          space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system in the manner of a photon  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron 
          like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation  
          Meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate  
          Unit velocity is the speed of light and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light 
          according to Larson's Theory  I might have the above and 
          below labels mixed up 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass
          LESS UNcharged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light 
    
               If this is true then the ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons or other particles in space perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion In Larson's Theory an electrical charge 
          is a onedimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B Larson has 
          been available for more than  YEARS published in  in 
          his first book THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE 
    
               It is TOTALLY UNSCIENTIFIC for Hawking Wheeler Sagan 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          science or physics or astronomy etc as well as 
          the scientific literature and the education systems to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such 
          as gammaray bursts and the nature of quasars 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals 
          in the US and elsewhere  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UWEC UWMadison Cambridge Cornell University and 
          elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed 
    
          

               For more information answers to your questions etc 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES especially Larson's BOOKS 



               UNaltered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this 
          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED

Capser before you deceive everone into thinking that the latterday
saints have undergone undue persecution through the years for just
believing in their religion perhaps you would like to tell us all what
happened in the Mountain Meadow Massacres and all the killings that were
done under the Blood Atonement Doctrine at the command of Brigham Young

I recently watched a an episode of The Old West a TV show on the 
Discovery Channel or perhaps the AE Network the one hosted by Kenny
Rogers  This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah
etc

A large portion of the broadcast was about the Mountain Meadows Massacre
The program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing
about the incident until long after it had happened before telegraph and
it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn
settlers into what amounted to a mob  All participants in the incident were
prosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church

I suggest you watch a rerun of that episode they play them over and over 
and see what they nonMormons have to say about it

 These particular Tibetans are advocating increased violence against 
 the Chinese occupiers  Are they wrong

Wrong about what   I think they are correct in thinking that a 
wellplaced bomb or six would get headlines but I think they are 
wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a 
Buddhist

Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide
against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans 
are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like
the Chinese occupiers   Every action is its own reward

 Clearly the occupation of Tibet has been largely ignored

On the other hand people who are aware of the occupation are mostly
full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up
with it   And what does it cost us to admire them   Zip

 Are Tibetans currently people of peace  Do they serve themselves 
 well or badly by being so

Yes they are and whether this serves them well or not depends on 
whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence
And without political independence can they preserve their cultural
and religious traditions

 Would an increased level of violence make them terrorists

The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists just as
the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements
as terrorists

 Assuming that the group advocating this course is correct and 
 greater attention is focussed on the occupation of Tibet by the 
 Chinese are the Tibetans better off as people of peace or
 as terrorists

Better off in what way   As proponents of pacifism or as 
proponents of political autonomy

And better off in what timescale   The Soviet Empire practised
cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities
some of which resisted violently and some of which did not but
in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least
some of the minorities survived

Now some of the minorities are fighting one another    Is that
because they have to or because violent resistance to an oppressive
Empire legitimized violence

A baby's innocence has nothing to do with whether the baby

The baby is innocent yet the baby is a sinner   
You have two arms and two legs  Why  Because your parents did
Why Because their parents did  Etc  Did you do anything to get them

The thing is I know what arms and legs are  It's therefore generally easy to
tell whether or not someone has arms and legs  This sinful nature since it
does not require that the baby actually perform any sins seems to be totally
invisible  As far as I know maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and
half don'tit'd look exactly the same since there is no way to tell the
difference

We are born sinners  We are born sinners because our parents
were born with it  We got it from them  We did nothing to earn
the title sinner  We get it because our parents had it their
parents had it their grandparents had it etc infinitum

So what's so bad about a sinful nature then  I could understand it being
bad if it always results in people committing sins but babies can have it
never commit sins die and they still have it  So the bad part about can't
merely be that it results in people committing sinsso what is bad about it

     I wasn't sure if this was the right newsgroup to post this to but I guess
the misc is there for a reason  Here goes  I am getting married in June to 
a devout Wisconsin Synod Lutheran  I would classify myself as a strong 
agnosticweak athiest  This has been a a subject of many discussions between
us and is really our only real obstacle  We don't have any real difficulties 
with the religious differences yet but I expect they will pop up when we have 
children  I have agreed to raise the
children nominally Lutheran  That is Lutheran traditions but trying to
keep an open mind  I am not sure if this is even possible though  I feel that
that the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind

     Anyway I guess I'll get on with my question  Is anyone in the same 
situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this  We've 
taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting 
anything get bottled up inside  Sometimes I get the feeling we're making this 
much bigger than it actually is  Any comments would be greatly appreciated  
Also please email responses since I don't get a chance to read this group
often

I'm curious to know if Christians ever read books based on critique
on the religion classical text such as Age of Reason by Paine
or The Myth Maker by Jacobi Sometimes it is good to know your
enemy and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
both sides and not solely the one and only right one

Yes one does  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by
I think Benjamin Franklin once a Deist  I found it amazing that
Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat   I also have the writings
on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf and it is amazing how
much he missed  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and 
Aristotelian Hylomorphesism  What a pile of junk  Jesus
makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners  Psychology
the id ego superego by Freud  Elements of truth but Jesus
explained it far better and gave reasons

Thomas Paine Benjamin Franklin Thomas Jefferson are mere men  They
can screw up the Bible just as well as any man  I do not put these
men on a pedestal  And if I remember TJ's autobiography correctly
he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met

Here's some more circular reasoning to you  Paul says to the Corinthians
that that the gospel will be foolishness to the world because it is 
spiritually discerned  And so people without the spirit of God haven't a
clue to what the Bible is saying   From your point of view that's
incredibly circular and convenient   To me it is mysteriously and supernaturally
bizarre   I can see it but you can't  This is not arrogance on
my part  Trust me  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me  But nonetheless
it is a truth explainable or not

Are any of you color blind to red and green  I am  Remember those
dot tests they do at the optomologist's  They put pictures in front
of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots  If
your eyes are perfectly normal you can see letters or numerals
embedded in the dots  They are a slightly different color and stand
out from the background  But if you are color blind to red and green
you will not see anything but grayshaded dots  That is how a dot
test appears to me  I do not see a pattern at all

A normal seeing person will see the patterns  And to him I seem like a
total anomaly  To him I appear as if I am missing the universe or something
It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything
that to him is as plain as day

That it what it is like with the Bible the Word of God to the believer
The believer can see the meaning in the words  I can see how the patterns
fit together  There is such depth  Such consistency   But then on the
other hand I notice the nonbeliever   He doesn't see it  He thinks
I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things   I look at him and
say No you are weird  You do not see   Then it is time for a sanity
check  I go to another Christian and say Do you see this  And
they go Yes  It is an X  And I say Thank God I see the X
too

It is truly the strangest thing   It adds a little extra dimension to
the phrase 

         He will make the blind see and the deaf hear


I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see  I wish every nonbeliever
could see what they are missing

Isn't that CONVEEEENIENT


Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your ' degree'
measurement that the temperature is in Centigrade rather than the
more common in the US Fahrenheit you are still laboring under at
least  misconceptions

  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around  C
    Actually the melting point of most iron alloys and steels are
    iron alloys is in the neighborhood of  C  Even if the gun
    were found in area which achieved the  C temperature the steel
    parts of the gun would not be deformed and it would still be
    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon

	Steel may not melt at C but it will weaken expand and deform
	If there is enough of a load on the steel like the load on a steel
	roof truss or the pressure exerted by steel parts in a machine
	trying to expand against each other the steel can and will
	deform extensively For the record any weapon found in
	the cult compound should be indentifiable but it may be
	impossible to do normal ballistics tests because of the 
	damage done to the weapon
 	
If if if  Anyway the question was if the gun was identifiable which
it is

Oh yes do

The doubt that has infiltrated the previous smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology has inflamed passions  There is lack of agreement
even within warring camps  Sometimes it seems as if there are as many 
variations on each evolutionary theme as there are individual biologists

Niles Eldridge yes he's a paleontologist Natural History Evolutionary

Dear me This is taken so out of context that it's hard to know where
to start The quote starts with material from p  and ends with material
from page 

On page  there's the bit that says the parts left out in John King's
quote are marked by 
 the doubt that has infiltrated the previous smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology's last twenty years has inflamed passions and
provoked some very interesting thought and research

Eldridge goes on immediately following the butchered quote
In short evolutionary biology has entered a phase of creativity that is
the hallmark of good active science

The material that is on page  that is quoted by John King has been
butchered even more severely

I mention this only to illustrate the There isthese words not

 things are really in uproar these days and each of the basic ways
of looking at evolutionary biology has its minor variants Sometimes
it seems as if there are as many variations on each evolutionary theme

Eldridge goes on
But that's the way it should be this is how science is supposed to operate

Jack

And just a few sentences down

When they creationists misrepresent the exuberant creative doubt and
controversy permeating evolutionary biology these days they are actively
promoting scientific illiteracy

And that John E King is precisely what you have done with Eldridge's
article Are you personally responsible for the butchery of the text or
have you pulled it out of some creationist propaganda You owe the people
reading to an apology for posting such misrepresentation

Rick Anderson writes

ra   Robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying
ra things like it is held that cf Kermit thread  On what
ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox

     Orthodox is a compound word It comes from 'orthos' straight true 
     right and from 'doxa' opinion doctrine teaching I use orthodox to 
     refer to 'right teaching'

   As opposed to Universal or Catholic or FourSquare Gosple I think that
   the Greek Orthodox Church would take high offense at your misuse of the
   word Your version of Christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived
   you make claims of biblecentricity that are not derivable soley from the
   Bible  About sixseven months ago you claimed that your primary objection
   to the LDS was that our doctrine was not biblederived And now this
   and other claims can be shown are also not bible interpeting bible


 
                                Right teaching is derived from letting God 
     speak to us through the Bible This can be from reading simple truths 
     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible

	Simple truths oh for example   

ra Who is that holds that Luke meant what you said he meant

     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are
     pertinent

     Luke  records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on
     an adjacent cross Truly I say to you today you will be with Me in
     paradise But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead
     and ascended to heaven If Christ Himself was not in heaven until
     Sunday how could the repentant thief have been there with Him The
     answer lies in the location of paradise when Jesus died

     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day


       paradise exalted to heaven

	paradise wasn't equal to heaven and now it is Yet you claim that
 	peeple can not be exalted to heaven nicht wahr


     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and 
     Lazarus as Abraham's Bosom to which the godly beggar Lazarus was
     carried by the angels after his decease Luke   Thus
     Abraham's Bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed
     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection

	When I read the story I found that  Abraham's Bosom wasn't so much
	a place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to Abraham

     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of 
     hades Hebrew Sheol reserved for believers who had died in the faith
     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven
     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary or
     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with
     the Father

	Gee this is fairly close to what the LDS call spirit prison and what
        you have called false doctrine

     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the
     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon But
     on Sunday after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene
     John  and her two companions Matthew  presumably He then
     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise
     including Abraham Lazarus and the repentant thief We read in
     Ephesians  concerning Christ Ascending on high He led captivity
     captive He gave gifts unto men 

     vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the SunSpot Gopher Archive 

 
                                             Presumably He led the whole
     band of liberated captives from hades ie the whole population of
     preresurrection paradise up to the glory of heaven

   This part is not supported from scripture nor does it support your
   claim that the paradise where Christ descended was exalted

   Making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the
   scripture

SunEphas
Sun  Wherefore he saith When he ascended up on high he led captivity
Sun captive and gave gifts unto men
Sun 
Sun XREF Psalms 
Sun  Thou has ascended on hight thout hast led captivity captive thou has
Sun  recieved gifts for men yea for the rebellious aslo that the LORD God
Sun  might dwell amoung them
Sun
SunEphas
Sun  Now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first
Sun into the lower parts of the earth   He that descended is the same
Sun also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all
Sun things   And he gave some apostles and some prophets and
Sun some evangelists and some pastors and teachers  For the
Sun perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the
Sun edifying of the body of Christ  Till we all come in the unity of
Sun the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man
Sun unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ  That we
Sun henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about
Sun with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning
Sun craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive  But speaking the
Sun truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head

   Using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison is now changed from
   a PreEaster postion to posteaster by God postion is not supportable
 
   Makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here



ra Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is
ra challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to
ra look at the Bible in order to see the truth but what of those who
ra see Biblical things differently from you

     I think that this characterization is faulty Whenever my 'personal 
     interpretation' is questioned I usually give a reason

  Yes and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading
  of the scriptures You have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural 
  proof need to be crosschecked The referencs that you supply often do
  not support your postion if they are read in the context of the scripture



     As for those that see things differently please put forward where
     there is a valid difference and we can discuss it 

     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one 
     views the Bible is somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff 
     that I glean from it Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can 
     have a discussion on that topic But to decry something that I put 
     forward without putting forward something else to discuss and to 
     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious

	How about that those who have been in paradise and have accepted
	the gosple will be judged of Jesus Christ and then return to the
	presence of God Is that somehow different from your expressed view
	that the paradise spoken of or Abraham's Bosom

ra Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
ra understands it

     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is 
     wrong then please show me from Scripture where it is wrong  Simply 
     stating that there are other views is not a proof Show it to me from 
     Scripture and then we can go on

	Should we go back and discuss your view on why the Angle of the Lord
	is the Lord again

 to a court to get any damages  You are theoretically suppossed to 
 be able to get damages for that but you have to give some evidence

    BD's were not contemplating suecide and there is no reason 
    to believe they committed one

No reason  How about these two

  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the
	corridors and set fire to it  The speed at which the fire spread
	is not inconsistent with this claim

	This morning on CNN tues April  Texas Cops say Arson is suspected
	because of two falsh points CNN also stated that  all surviors
	claim the fires are FBI set  Your argument are madeup untrue
	and unverified at best

  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound
	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this
	fire  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did

    The day of the attack the FBI claimed to have seen two BD'ers setting
    the fire outside of the compound Yesterday the arson squad said two 
    flash points at the or near the tank entry points

    Not good evidence for the FBI hit squad

  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide it is very possible that
	David Koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this
	was not suicide  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort

  is there a difference between thinking that you won't survive a confrontation
  with the FBI parnoia and committing suicide


There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction


B  The fire was started by an FBI accident  This is possible but it would be
	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it
	Sure it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
	which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
	the day near the edge of the complex  It's anecdotal evidence that
	has been contradicted by other escapees

	No claimed by the escapees  not contradicted

	What I'm finding interesting is the conflicting reports FBI says
	that bodies have been found with bullet wounds and the Texas Cornuers
	sp says that they haven't yet found any bullet holes

Frank you are attempting to inject goodness judgements where there
are only accuracy judgements by essentially punning on the word
'value' which has both meanings 

useful is a goodness judgement  Reasonable is an accuracy judgement 
They are not the same thing at all Useful in making some conclusion is 
an accuracy judgement again I'm afraid 

This is the root of the problem I bloomin' well amn't punning on the
word value  I know it's ambiguous  I've told you the sense in
which I'm using it worth use goodness etc  And value DOESN'T mean
accuracy by any stretch of the imagination  Valueresult of a computation
is not what I mean but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of
'value'  Value  accuracy comes from out of left field  

I can only understand that by 'useful in making some conclusion is an accuracy
judgement' you mean one can judge whether it is really useful in making
that conclusion or not   That's part of what I mean by objective
valuation  values grounded in solid facts  One doesn't value x for the 
purpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn't really do that The
rest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values eg  our own 
freedom are solid facts in themselves

Consider each of the following statements

 The only reason that the distinction between 'accurate' and 
'inaccurate' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful  

 The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people
finds the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' useful in
dealing with phenomena

 Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in
modelling phenomena

Where is the 'pun' of which you speak  Where am I arguing from idiom  
And what is wrong if those statements are true with concluding that the 
basis of science is its judged usefulness in dealing with phenomena ie 
'subjective' values    After all what on earth is  if not a 
'subjective' value judgement  an 'accurate' value judgement maybe

Just to illustrate what I mean what's the difference between saying
'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have
to model phenomena' and say 'Love and intelligence are the best tools we have
to achieve freedom'  Is one 'objective' the other not  Both are 
judgements about value best and both have the same empirical basis from 
where I sit

Sorry Frank but all you're doing is
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue IF you
mean to say that science is based on value accuracy judgements
I have no problem with that If you mean to say that it's based
on value goodness judgements that's nonsense By contrast
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements

I'm afraid I do mean to say that it's based on goodness judgements
Simple theories with accurate predictions are better better BETTER 
tools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate 
predictions is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make  A 
relativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of science 
or of a given scientist  but it seems pretty solid and objective to me

Abortion is done because the mother can not afford the pregnancy



If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then
your statement would make sense  But that is not the case so it doesn't

Are we paying for the birth or not Mr Parker  If so why can't the
mother afford the pregnancy  If not what is the meaning of the
latter objection  You can't have it both ways

Birth  pregnancy  If they were the same the topic of abortion would

 Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
 to questions of science  

it  Did Jesus exist by G A Wells

     There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
     based on more than science alone  

Nope no fallacy  Yep science is best in determining how religions handle
why and who


Rich I am curious as to why you and others award custody of the baby to
theists and religion

I hope I didn't award custody Rich  I purposely used handle in order to 
avoid doing so  ie that happens to be what religions do of course there are
aberrations like scientific creationism  I used best in part to indicate 
that science currently has a time of it with why and who so these domains are
mostly ignored  I also attempted to be brief which no doubt confused the
matter  As an aside for science I should have written how and when  Nobody
seems to argue over what

Are they theists theologians any better equiped to investigate the who and 
why than magicians astrologers housewives not being sexists athiests or 
agnostics

Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual  I'm not
trying to be evasive on this but from a societal perspective religion works
On the other hand sometimes it is abused and misused and many suffer which
you know  But the net result seems positive this from the anthropological
perspective on human affairs  You might call me a neoFruedian insofar as I 
think the masses can't get along without religion  Not that generally they are 
incapable they just don't and for myriad reasons but the main one seems to 
be the promise of immortality  Very seductive that immortality  Therefore 
it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for 
dispensing answers to who and why  I suggest that this holds regardless of 
the truth in their answers to who and why simply because people believe  
In the end spiritual beliefs are just as real as scientific facts and 
explanation CAUTION TO SOME DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT  

Do you suggest that the who and why will forever be closed to scientific 
investigation

No  In fact I don't think it is closed now at least for some individuals 
Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was 
created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity  This approach might 
presuppose an absence of who and why except that it seems it could be argued 
that something had to be responsible for nothing  Maybe that something doesn't
have to be supernatural maybe just mechanistic  But that's a tough one for
people today to grasp  In any case theory without empirical data is not 
explanation but then your question does not require data  In other words 
I agree that theorizing within scientific parameters is just as scientific 
as explaining  So the answer is who and why are not closed to scientists but 
I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate  Data will 
be necessary for improvement and that seems a long way off if ever  Pretty 
convoluted here I hope I've made sense  

It seems to me that  or so years ago the question of the origin of life on
earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry

I agree generally  But I prefer to put it this way  the questions of how 
when who and why were not open to inquiry  During the Enlightenment 
reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when 
and not for the most part who and why  Science was thus born out of the 
naturalists' curiosity eventually carting away the how and when while largely 
leaving behind the who and why  The ignorant the selfish the intolerant and
the arrogant of course still claim authority in all four domains

Rich Fox Anthro Usouthdakota

Did like your discussion around AMHs and I did figure out what AMH was from
your original post 

Much obliged  Funny how facts tend to muddle things isn't it  Well I am
sure there are plenty of scientific creationist rebuttals out there 
somewhere even if they have to be created from nothing

just for the record again AMH  anatomically modern humans

Because of course that possibility existed  Meaning any student who
really gave a shit could have a moment of silence on hisher own which
makes more sense than forcing those who DON'T want to participate to
have to take part  What other reason is there for an organized moment
of silence
 
A moment of silence doesn't mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise it's not silent now is it
 
The whole point is maybe everyone doesn't want to participate
 

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic
 
Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it that is

Not noticing that danger is utterly idiotic
Please provide evidence that having a moment of silence for a student
who died tragically costs taxpayers money

    In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words 
translated into the word hell  These Greek words have totally different 
meanings  The words are Hades Tartaros and Gehenna

    In bibical usage the Greek word Hades is used only  times in the 
New Testament and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol
meaning the grave or pit compare Acts  with Psalms   Hades may be 
likened to a hole in the ground In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire

    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell
to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice  

    Why  Because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the 
traditional connotation of an everburning inferno when this was never 
remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English

    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of 
the dead but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of 
shadowy realm  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave  All dead go to 
this hell

    The second hell of the Bible Tartaros is mentioned only once in 
scripture  Pet For if God spared not the angels that sinned but cast 
them down to hell TARTAROS and delivered them into chains of darkness to be 
reserved unto judgment

    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne Isa 
Rev the archangel Lucifer now Satan and a third of the created angels 
now demons were ejected from heaven Luke   They were cast down to 
Tartaros a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the 
mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment Jude   Cor

    Tartaros then is a hell that applies only to evil rebellious angels or
demons It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe 
the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans  Nowhere in the Bible 
is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell

    The the third word that is translated as hell in the Bible is Gehenna It
comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM meaning valley of Hinniom  Hinnom is a 
deep narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem

    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites including 
infant sacrifice It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made 
their children pass through the fire to the god Molech  The rites were 
specifically celebrated in Tophet the place of abhorrence one of the chief 
groves in the valley

    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations  He 
defiled the valley rendering it ceremonially unclean  Kings   Later 
the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem a repository for 
sewage refuse and animal carcasses  The bodies of dispised criminals were 
also burned there along with the rubbish  Fires burned continuously feeding 
by a constant supply of garbage and refuse

    Aceldama the field of blood purchased with the money Judas received for
the betrayal of Christ Matt was also in part of the valley of Hinnom

    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell  

    In Rev the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracleworking 
religious figure the False Prophet working with him will resist the 
reestablishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming
Their fate is revealed by the apostle John And the beast was taken and with 
him the false prophet  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire 
burning with brimstone
    
    Where will this temporary lake of fire this hell be

    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast For 
Tophet in the valley of Hinnom is ordained of old yea for the king it is 
prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and wood 
the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it Isa

    One thousand years later Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled 
fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast Rev

    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia  Does the Bible 
say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of 
fire

    In the sequence of Rev the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be 
thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there Rev What will 
become of these wicked  Will they writhe in flames for eternity 
 
    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna 
fire on the earth  They wil be consumed annihilated destroyed  This 
punishment will be everlasting permanent and final  The Bible calls it the 
second death Rev  from which there is no possibility of a 
further resurrection

    The Bible does teach eternal punishment but not eternal punishing
                           
    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description For behold the day 
cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do 
wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up
  To the righteous God says that the wicked shall be ashes under the 
soles of your feetMal

    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death not a place of living 
torture  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or 
valley of Hinnom  Utter destruction by fire was complete  Nothing was left 
but ashes
 
    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means 
complete destruction not living torture not eternal life in torment  The 
Bible says in Romans  The wages of sin is death not eternal life in 
torture  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death the cessation of 
life 
    
    Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD

 bad thoughts these

  well it depends on whether you take the literal dictionary definition of
cult and say all faiths are cults or if you take a more socialcontext
view of cult which allows you to recognize mainstream religions as 
sociallyacceptable and cults as groups that involve techniques of brain

Now does anyone know a way to back up the masters of WordPerfect  for

my masters and I'm worried they'll get screwed up  Please don't tell me

You realize of course that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than SMCAPBOLDFontGod

But that's irrelevant to the problem here  Windows came with my
system but on  disks  I hate using  disks so I copied
them over to high density 's using xcopy  It worked fine  In
fact for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory but if you want to you
can simply copy them all into one directory  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around

Norton  I don't have much experience with but when a friend's
system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals and it worked fine  This would imply that arj a r norton
cnu would create a workable backup and if you did a full install
the first time you've got the whole thing

Never played with WP for Windows I'm not too big of a fan of anything

Good luck

Does anyone know of a software that can exchange caps lock and ctrl
keys on the ATstyle keyboard  I'm looking for a memory resident
program that can work with other programs rather than a feature in a
specific program I am aware of a shareware program back and forth
that provides this feature within that program  Thanks

   A program in the archive keymapzip on simtel and mirror sites in the 
msdoskeyboard directory will do this  It is written in assembler and it 
best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map  It is possible 
however to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard 
driver if you do not have a compiler  I used hexedzip also available 
on simtel  Simply serach for the codes     to locate the biginning 
of the normal keyboard map  Then swap the codes for the keys that you 
wish to swap  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report 
the scancode for each key to you some bios programs also have this info
Good luck

 Pete

I need a device either an ISA board or a subsystem which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC etc but I need it for RGB

Please email and or post any leads

Well my inch VGA xinterlacing  year old no brand monitor just
bit the bullet I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later the power
light went out with a POP Gawd it's only been two and half years

How long would normal monitors last I think the problem with my monitor is
the power switch but the image was getting pretty dim anyway I needed to
have my contrast all the way to the max And the screen did flicker from
time to time Is this normal hehehe or do I just have the worst of luck

Question What do I do now Buy a new one Get it fixed Save up for a
really good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now I rather save
my money to upgrade my SX to  though

Thanks

          My computer arrived with the following statement in its

Exactly

Regardless of what Microsoft says I have set STACKS on every single

with EISA motherboards NDI Volante TIGA adapters Intel Ethernet Express
cards and caching SCSI controllers from DPT and DTC

Not a problem yet and the extra K gained means a lot with conventional

I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with
my Gateway  DX VLBus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB  
When I have my computer in any resolution other than x everything is
fine but whenever I use it in x Windows AutoCAD GIFs the screen 
gets about   inches shorter  At the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a  bar of black  The screen isn't cut off it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio  While I can
manually change the VSize on the back this is a pain in the ass and it just
shouldn't happen anyway  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't 
been able to help me at all  Two different times they sent me a new card and
both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer  They even tried
to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of
days when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than  weeks
before billing my card  But their customer support is a different story
So if anyone has had this same problem please let me know if you know what
to do  Hell let me know if you don't have a solution just so I know I'm
not the only one with this problem  Thanks in advance

Yes You bought the WRONG SIMMSYou need X or X which are  pin

bitbit parity one for each byte Chunks You will undoubtedly see these
SIMMS becoming more widely used in the near future

I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase  One

Remember if you use Amex you must either send a copy of the warranty info

   Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways
lately on here I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences My
machine DXV this past Friday This was two weeks to the DAY from
when I called the order in 

   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order All the 
peripherals I ordered were properly installed Jumbo  CDROM I
was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway 
documentation All software came with the original disks and manuals
The Gateway manual itself is in a nice ring binder The ATI GUP came
with build drivers All other software I specified Microsoft Office
was properly installed The machine came right up out of the box and 
has been performing flawlessly It's been on all weekend and it hardly
even reaches room temperature I think the big roomy tower case has a 
lot to do with it 

   It's up and running DOS  with no problems I've also read about
some people having problems with high speed serial communications 
I used the DOS  InterLink program which lets me link to my old
computer via a serial port at K baud It then maps the other
machines two hard disks as my disks F  G You can cd to these
drives and either run programs or copy files It's almost like a
peerpeer lan except you can also run programs on the other machine
It's not a two way street The other machine is the server and this
machine is the client So thats where it seems to differ from the 
peer to peer stuff For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive 

  My Jumbo took about  minutes to back up MB of data I also
bypassed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the 
credit and applying it towards a NEC FG I love this monitor

  So I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it
was me Now if it just KEEPS working

 Another thing why a SCSI interface 

 By giving the MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and
 make it easily installed in existing devices

easily installed in existing pc clone devices you mean
and thats not even really true cause neither the controller
nor the computers bios will know anything about them

and it probably wouldnt be in sony's or whoever best interest
to restrict themselves to customers using pc clones and apple s
and whatever other obsolete boxes might use the familiar old
floppy interface

 Have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone  At least
 locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and
 he has to fix it

Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms but not so
quick and not so competent from others Gateway included  But my experience
with computer retailers which is significant has lead to the conclusion that
sales personnel and retailtechnical personnel are forbidden to actually learn
about the products they sell  Talk about incompetent  OK so a few percent
of their answers are correct but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid
they are       OK  I'll settle down now   let me
catch my breath  

Fact retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product

Retail outlets are desirable however to those people who aren't interested
in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions  This is fine
for example most of my education about carpeting wall paper lawn mowers
microwave ovens etc has come from sales personnel  I assume I must be an
idiot  But I don't care about those things  I do however care about my
computer  ie I demand features and performance and I'll be damned if I'll
pay some highschool drop out commission on an overrated overpriced system
and in the process be subjected to his distorted BS

Thanks to all who responded to my original post  I got the number for
Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the
BIOS to the Super BIOS  It will handle hard drives with up to  read
write heads and up to  cylinders  The upgrade is  payable by
check or money order  Send to

	Western Digital Corporation
	Technical Support Group
	PO Box 
	Irvine CA  

The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the
WD series

The BIOS on my system would only handle up to mb drives

The responses to my request for help follow my sig  Warning It's long

Keith

In article driceponder you write
I recently bought a used Seagate ST hard drive  The guy told me that
it had been fully tested and that it was good  I took it home to install
in my Compaq Portable OK I'm a little behind in technology  I already
had an MFM controller

I installed the drive and powered up the system  I got a post error 

My controller is a Western Digital WDSWX Rev C
As I said above the drive is a Seagate ST
The system is a Compaq Portable circa 

     Ah finally a question I can answer   I mess with this older
stuff alot   Kinda fun  

     First problem I can forsee is that the ST will not be
compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom  

    Check the numbers on it  It should be the only nonsmt chip on
the board  Slightly below center and left    The bios should read 
either       or
             x

     If the last  digits are  you got problems


Controller jumpers are set as follows  represents jumper
	W	 
       W       
	W	
	W	 
	W	  
	W	 
	W	  

    Looks right   W and W are factory jumped with a trace between
pins  and  to select the primary controller address

The drive jumpers are as follows  represents jumper

    Looks right
  
art deleted

Here are my questions

	Are the drive and controller compatible w each other

      I notice you left out the S jumper table settings   Those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has   If you have
the  rom set it like this

                    open
                    open             
                    open        
                    open
                    closed
                    closed
                    open
                    open

    Note   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block
Top to bottom   's represent the jumper pins    Pins  and 
select the first drive setting drive  and pins  and  select the
second drive drive    

      If you have the  rom it's a autoconfig and I'll have
to look up how to do it I don't have the big book right here

	Are the jumpers on the carddrive set correctly

      See above  You might have problems if the S jumpers are not
right   Also  at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables
are on right and good     On the jumper on the  try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive    It's one or the other   
     The narrow data cable goes to J   I've thrown it on J a few
times and banged my head for a day

	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade

     Dunno    IBM roms had to be later than    A quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug   Enter
       
        d ffff fffc    the  is the debug prompt
   
    This will return the rom date if it's of any use

Keith Rice

      If I oversimplified any of the above I appologize     It's
just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to

If you are using a TWISTED way cable then move the jumper 
on your drive to the neighbouring pins     Make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk and not a floppy disk  the
coloured stripe pin  should be furthest from the twist

This may also help

Help

I need to implement COM and COM on a board that I'm designing and I'm
finding it dificult to track down a definition hardware that is of COM
and COM

I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM shares IRQ with COM and COM
shares IRQ with COM except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not
clear especially if the existing COM does not allow IRQ sharing Does the
standard allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how

Please answer by email to

this one is ideal  it leaves out DSR and RI rarely used anymore
if you're really paranoid or you just have an th wire to spend
you might add
	FG     FG

the pin numbers above are obviously for pin connectors
i don't have a pin pinout handy

  Hi All

  I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards eg one
can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters etc
  Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some nontrivial data
to the KB as opposed to standard NumLock OnOff typeamatic specs from
inside the PC software I have not found any corresponding reference in the
specs for the  PCKB interface Anyone have any ideas Except that they
may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above
which wouldn't look too neat besides what would one do from an XT

  Great thanks in advance

Andrew

 As far as I can tell the MD is an offshoot of technology that already exists
 It is an MO drive  MO drives exist already for computers  They're expensive
 and a bit slow but the disks are cheep  mb disks  Dan

I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new
digit audion formats DCC and MD but at the end talked about how nice
it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of
how much data you could store The author had been talking to someone
from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply MD
is a purely audio format we wouldn't use it for data then when
pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD

What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio
player prices I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system
can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up
the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program

Another thing why a SCSI interface  for MDs

By giving the MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and
make it easily installed in existing devices

This question is to me like asking Why use SCSI at all

 Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution which is used by almost all
  floppy interfaces of PCs the speed is limited to approx  Kbytess 
  I want a standard allowing higher performance

 With SCSI the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other
  things Later when the controller has performed the search and physical read
  data can be transferred to main memory at RAM speeds Not very relevant with
  MSDOS but MSDOS is not made for the future

 I've got a SCSI interface I've got a  and a  floppy too and I am
  not going to throw them out With SCSI I may add for all practical purposes
  an unlimited number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks 

 For my PC I've got a  Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine and I
  can carry it over to a Mac a Sparcstation an Alpha machine whatever I like
  to if I decide to turn my back to the PC I do know that I cannot expect
  to move the data without reformatting

There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well

After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about Mb isnt all that
much so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk

No not replace but supplement And contrary to a floppy a MD may be fast enough
to run programs or access data directly off the MD So we'll have much higher
expectationsdemands which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppy
interface And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more  isn't it
something like a dozen large pizzas nowadays

    I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar
  problems I don't like to take the thing to the dealer
  only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it I
  checked the other post in this group about Maxtor and
  I don't seem to be the only one who has problems However
  no one describes the same problem and I also have a 
  different configuration

	Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my
masters  Apparently they are NOT copyprotected I just used a program that
is unable to handle highdensity old shit  I was surprised to hear that
NO programs on highdensity disks have copy protection which someone
back there said  Huh  Learn something new every day

I could I suppose switch the  com devices externally and disable
the second port on the Super IO card but I really want to 
have them both available

COuld the sound card use IRQ without horsing up the works

Hi I recently switched my old Amiga  with a DX My computer
configuration is 

DX Mhz  kB EISA Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA Mhz
MB Ram
STN  MB Harddisk SCSI
UltraStorF EISA Cache Controller

When I use Norton Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer
about  kbsec and sometimes MBsec Is that good  I thought
that with EISA I could get about MBsec 
Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host 
adapters need to perform a lowlevel format to optimize the harddisk 
performance in that system do I need that 
A guy I know gets a HD transfer about MBsec and he has an STA and
a ISA DX how can a ISA with the same system be faster 

Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk 


                                        Thanks

AY  In many recent advertisements I have seen both DX and DX
AYbased systems Does the first really exists and does it imply that all
AYcircuitry on the motherboard with it works at that speed as opposite 
AYlatter where only the internals of the CPU are working at MHz
AY
AY Many thanx in advance

Andrew yes there is a DX and DX version of the MHz   If you are 
considering buying one or the other definitely go for the DX with a nice 
size external cache  The performance is far greater

The DX only has the internal k cache to work with at MHz while the DX 
has a potentially much larger cache to work at MHz with  Neither 
systems could actually run a program out of main memory since DRAM is 
still too slow for that high of bus speed  ns  MHz  MHz

MG 	I went buying SIMMs recently and the sales person told me that 
the
MG are chip SIMMs and chip SIMMs and one cannot use them interchan
MG If you use one you have to use all of the same type

don't believe everything you are told  I can tell you that mixing them 
between 'banks' ok and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless 
they are of different speeds  eg mixing of ns and ns SIMMs in one 
bank   The two only differ in the type of chips it uses  Assuming that 
the SIMMS are Mx   bit wide  here is the two equivalent 
configuration  The chip SIMM uses two bit wide Mbit M of bit 
nibbles  and one bit wide Mbit chip  for a total of bit wide Mbyte 
  The bit SIMM uses nine bit wide Mbit chips  These are equivalent 
because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board  At the SIMM 
interface they both act as bit wide MByte SIMMS     sorry 
if too techie for ya


MG 	Similarly one cannot plug in two MB SIMMs and one MB SIMMs to 
gi
MG the system a total of  MEG Why is that so  If my system supports
MG of  MEG it has  SIMM slots can I plug in  MB SIMMs to give my
MG MB 

That sounds correct  the problem is that if your computer takes bit 
wide SIMMs you can not mix different sizes in one bank  Why you ask  
Simple  if you understand why there is banks  Assuming you have a bit 
CPU  DX or   the data bus eg the mechanism to retrieve data 
from memory  is bits wide so the computer expects to see  bits when 
it asks for data  To get that bandwidth  bit wide  the motherboard 
links  Mx  one bit is not data but parity so I will ignore that in 
this simple explaination  to get bits   bits   That means 
that a SIMM in a bank stores only  of the  bit wide data  If you 
have a bit bus two Mx SIMMs are linked together to get bit wide 
data which is the reason why  banks are  SIMMs wide and bit banks 
are  SIMMs wide  If your computer required Mx  eg bit wide data 
with  parity bits used in some PSs and ASTs  you could upgrade by 
one SIMM at a time

Hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your 
question was not simple  I could of just said 'because I said so'

I saw a posting about the choice between DX and a DX
I was wondering although a DX is faster because of the path to it's
external cache shouldn't the choice be the DX as that one can be
made to work properly with a localbus I mean cache speed is one thing
but all your speed will be blocked during video IO so just get that
faster 
I'm willing to speculate that the DX with localbus will be  times 
as fast as the DX and probably as expensive or cheap

No rumour IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last
fall COMDEX or something I wasn't there All you people who are
drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU just like
SX that Evil Marketing Ploytm from Intel don't you It has K
of internal cache which probably is where the saved silicon real
estate went Because of some contract IBM is not allowed to sell its
 chips to third parties so these chips are unlikely to become
available in any nonIBM machines Of course nothing prevents other
companies from implementing a DX but nobody hasn't even come out
with a real DX FPU and all clone yet although AMD soon will

like to format it When trying to format it no lowlevel
format just FDISK and DOS FORMAT I somehow messed up the
parameters I had entered FDISK MBR not exactly knowing
what this does
The suggested drive type  formats the drive only to MB
I tried type  but this gives only around MB and not
the nominal MB
Could I use user type  However I don't know the actual
parameters cylinders heads Could someone give me them
And how does FDISK work together with user type

I own a Stealth  card from diamond  When using the Xxmil win 
driver the card and driver work but are not very fast  ALL of the other
windows drivers have a number of bugs  Shadows remain when windows are
erased and text boxes are often unreadable  All attempts to get help from
Diamond have failed  I have called the Tech support and never been able
to get past the hold line a toll call in a reasonable time ie min
Leaving voice mail has not helped either  The BBS is a joke It always
has too many people on to download anything  You cannot even get a file
listing it considers that a download  I have faxed the tech support group
All this with no reponse

The bottom line is if you are looking for a fast card and want to use it
for windows DO NOT get a Diamond product  Try another vendor I wish I had

While others here may have had better experiences I too share the
sentiments posted above  Though I have the original StealthVRAM
it is only relatively recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use ie will not due to shadowing
misdrawn check boxes etc  I believe the version I have is 
If there's a more recent release I'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know  I haven't been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again  Naturally Diamond doesn't even bother
notifying me of fixesreleases

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the right person in curing
some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict  The conflicting
addresses E E were OMITTED in at least my version of the
DiamondVRAM manual  I hope it has been corrected by now  The tech rep
explained that ALL Sbased boards use these addresses  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future hopefully with some
form of local bus I'll seek a video solution from someone other than

way to 'piggyback' or expand a slot motherboard all bit
to get the usual   My case has slots for  and I'd like to
get a scanner but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out
I'm hoping that a simple solution exists eg an adapter that turns
one slot into three  I don't mind if it turns it into bit slots
as I can put my IO card MIDI card and Soundblaster card there
My other cards are  bit IDEFloppy SVGA modem

If there is such an expander does that screw up performance of
everything else  I'd hate to buy a new motherboard

I just received my Gateway  DX minidesktop system
The first thing I noticed when I plugged in the power cord is the
noise that comes from the fan In fact I can hear the noise in

If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive then the noise
is probably coming from there and not from the fan  The Western drives
are notoriously noisy  On the other hand if you don't have a Western
drive then maybe it is the fan  There's not alot to do about it except
insulate around the cpu somehow

Hi I recently switched my old Amiga  with a DX My computer

UltraStorF EISA Cache Controller

When I use Norton Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer
about  kbsec and sometimes MBsec Is that good  I thought
that with EISA I could get about MBsec 
Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host 
adapters need to perform a lowlevel format to optimize the harddisk 
performance in that system do I need that 
A guy I know gets a HD transfer about MBsec and he has an STA and
a ISA DX how can a ISA with the same system be faster 

Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk 


 Dont rely on benchmarks They often show incorrect due to different
   TSR programs

 SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card

 Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is x faster

 You can disable disconnect and get some kBs but just to loose the mouse
   or other ints when diskaccesing

I get MBs with DX LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXTSY  Coretest

Hello  I hope somebody out here can help me  I am currently working
on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM  with
Phoenix BIOS using C to a board that I made with an Intel  CPU
with UART chip  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and 
Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit but there seems to be something wrong
with the initialization or protocol used when I try C  I need to
access the unit I built using C because I have a sizable chunk of C
code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that
will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 

I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C code
that I am trying to use  If anyone can show me something that I
am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack
of knowledge about RS serial communications please email me
I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and
then to check it against the x character if a x is received 
the LEDs will indicate this  Two C programs that I have written do
nothing but set up COM port  and send the x character  One uses
the bioscom function in biosh the other uses the software interrupt
int function in dosh  I have triple checked the baud rate   
the parity  none  the stop bits    the character length   bits 
and the interrupt calls for  x   Currently I am at a loss as
to what may be wrong  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment


						Thanks alot

 I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase  One

 read the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank
 VISA  Sure both will allow you double warranty on computers but Citibank
 has a maximum claim of   Could you imagine trying to get your
 monitor or mother board fixed for   Amex has NO limit on claims
 
 Remember if you use Amex you must either send a copy of the warranty info
 to them in  days from purchase or you must call them to preregister and
 then send them the paperwork within  days of purchase my preregister
 pak arrived today  Citibank VISA requires no preregistration

I just talked to a rep for my ATT mastercard regarding this  There is no
maximum claim and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the 
item needs repair  If it can't be repaired you get the amount you paid
for it
Curiously though the ATT Gold mastercard has a limit of  on claims
Definitely not upgrading to that card

I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributersplus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about

These questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points but I will
provide some unsolicited advice  the most amusing kind of advice

Today Tueday  IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems  These systems still have onboard
video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems and
you get VESA Local Bus for future upgrades  We are going to buy three of
them with  monitors also a newly available and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to UltraStor F caching SCSI disk controller and
either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board

Do not buy a SX sytem

My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not lossfree  When
you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes  ie they
get you coming and going  Translated this means take infrequent but large
steps  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX
models and go straight to the DX or DX models

Howdy

Sorry if this has been covered before

One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS  on his
NEC Powermate SX SX   Of course I said No problem and went to work
Unfortunately the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during 
installation even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old DOS  After openning it up I discovered it was using an bit 
Seagate SCSI controller on a STN SCSI Mbtye drive  I then booted 
with DRDOS  off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
I could access the drive  Lo and behold the primary  Mbyte partition 
was intact created by DOS  no less I didn't think you could go over a
Mbyte partition in the older DOSes I could be wrong  I then tried 
to remove the primary partition which it wouldn't allow me to do  I am 
unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive I 
kinda expected it to work just like an IDEMFMRLL drive for DOS 
installations  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated except for 
Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC

Thanks in advance

I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC I am
running Linux as my main OS with a small DOS partition left for my
flatmates' games

My current setup is a SX AMD with SX ITT  I think and 
Mbytes of ns SIMMS and Mbyte IDE

Basically I have two choices

 Get a DX  DX  or
 Get some sort of 

Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high
The first option works out at about pounds   mboards start at
this price for a SX

I have a couple of questions

 How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a
DXcopro Remember I'm using a  bit OS and alot of Floating Point
operations

 How much faster would a DX be than the DXcopro 

Should I get an upgradeable mboard with a DX and wait for
AMDPentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the  

	Any experiences will be most helpful

Hi
I've got a Multi IO card IDE controller  serialparallel
interface and two floppy drives     and a
Quantum ProDrive AT connected to it
I was able to format the hard disk but I could not boot from
it I can boot from drive A which disk drive does not matter
but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch
the LED of drive A continues to glow and the hard disk is
not accessed at all
I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi Io card
or floppy disk drive settings jumper configuration
Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it
Please reply by email to GERTHDMVSSASCOM
Thanks
Thomas

A silly question I frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them
on several floppy diskettes of the same size and format but my computer is
only equipped with one  HD drive and one  HD drive can't I do the
copying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk which is  full
using standard MSDOS  commands I know
diskcopy a a
works but for small selections of files
xcopy atxt a
does not
Maybe I'll have to write my own file copy command in C but the idea does not
amuse me
Thanks for your help

So by going mailorder through Gateway I save   Plus I get
technical support over the phone free software package

Have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone  At least
locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and
he has to fix it
    
How long does he have to take in fixing it  Does he have to use new
parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your
knowledge  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty
but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part 

When it comes to local dealers

 Have fun getting consistently good support  Most of their techs are
retreaded salesmen not trained technicians with a high turnover rate

 Have fun getting inwarranty work done quickly and courteously

 Have fun getting outofwarranty work done cheaply or even done
period unless you are on a paid service contract

Having been both a service technician and a service manager at a
ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place I know what
I'm talking about 

I also know the local service scam that retail computer dealers like
to push when they're selling  It's that same old song that car dealers
having been singing for years  Buy from me and you'll get good
service We always treat our customers right  Buy from my competition
and you'll be sorry if you need service 

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service including overnight replacement parts 
onsite calls etc There are probably some local dealers that can give you
good service too But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good 
service you are wrong  I have many anectdotes to prove my point 
but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can

I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day

Some background about my PC

 American Megatrend BIOS clone  SX with M of RAM
 configsys file

	devicecdoshimemsys
	doshighumb
	devicecwindowsemmexe noems
	files
	buffers
	stack

 autoexecbat file is using smartdrvexe c
 CMOS set up is running  wait state on read and write cache ram

The problem APPLICATION ERROR from WIN

I started off with a newly installed WIN and then installed EXCEL
Run excel no problem A permanent swap file of size K was in place
for windows

Ok I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version  No problem with the installation I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexecbatwith the nav running on c
The problem came when I try to bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it  like click a selection with the mouse
from the desktop
First of all I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages The
following are some of them

 Stack fault by TCDRV at address XXXX where XXXX is some
  number TCDRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture
 General protection fault by ndwexe at the same address
 Segment load failure by ndwexe at same address

Some how the address flagged was always something What is address
XXXX means 

I have absolutely on idea what this mean I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexecbat no help

Is it something to do with the emm setup which is not telling
WIN what it suppose to know Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running

Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion I'm willing to try
anything

 I saw a posting about the choice between DX and a DX
 I was wondering although a DX is faster because of the path to it's
 external cache shouldn't the choice be the DX as that one can be
 made to work properly with a localbus I mean cache speed is one thing
 but all your speed will be blocked during video IO so just get that
 faster 
 I'm willing to speculate that the DX with localbus will be  times 
 as fast as the DX and probably as expensive or cheap 
 
Technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a DX and
a MHz local bus

I'm waiting for the mezzianine sp VL bus that will be decoupled from
the main CPU clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers

This will allow the use of ever faster CPUs with the same standard IO
cards Until the next buss spec

  BKIs it possible to plug in ns or ns SIMMs into a motherboard saying

  You shouldn't have troubles  I have heard of machines having problems 
  with slower than recommended memory speeds but never faster  
 
 
 It should run without any trouble of course but why do you want to buy some
 ns and mixed them with ns  ns is more expensive than ns and
 furthermore your machine will run the slowest SIMMs clock speed eventhough
 you have ns  Just my cents thought
 


Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered toCMOS is set to
usually wait states regardless of what speed RAM is installed  No
motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed unless you call
failing as a sort of autosense  This is how you can sometimes use
slower RAM in a machine  You either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow RAM in which case all memory will run at that
slower rate or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash

Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster RAM  

Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus 
slowed down to accomodate slow RAM

Please reply via email since this is job related 

I have a Colorado Jumbo backup system at one of my places of 
employment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool

Is there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried Does it simply need 
cleaning

Any and all comments will be appreciated

What am I trying to do what am I trying to say I'm not trying to tell you 
 anything you didn't know when you woke up today
				 Depeche Mode Nothing MUSIC FOR THE MASSES
 Stephen R Husak  husakuxcsouiucedu  Univerisity of Illinois

Does it do it to all tapes  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole  It was only on a few tapes of a set

Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels

If you have not yet open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base  
As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more 
than you have to  As you are doing it look for a couple of little holes in 
the tape  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is 
at the end of the tape  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart  My best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker  

Anyhow If the tape has the holes then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes  The
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out  When the hole goes by the pickup detects the 
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop  If the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment unlikely since it is made into the case you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape

If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good then either
the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty  If you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the RW head
assembly  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way then the drive may
need to be serviced  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor
is out 

If it is still in warranty you might be able to send it back to CMS for
repair

 Because of some contract IBM is not allowed to sell its
  chips to third parties so these chips are unlikely to become
 available in any nonIBM machines 

I saw in this months PC or PC World an ad for computers using IBM's SLC
So I don't think IBM is restricted in selling their chips at least not
anymore A clocktripled  even without coprocessor would be great
especially with k onboard cache Make it  pincompatible and you
have the chip upgrade that dreams are made of

First of all thanks to those of you who responded both here and via email
The tips didn't pan out but it was good hearing from you

Now following up to my earlier post

 Disk controller  Acculogic sIDE  hard floppy IDE controller
   Jumpers  All defaulted shown as   
     Normal IRQdelayed IRQ     Primarysecondary floppy address
     Singledual speed floppy   Primarysecondary IDE address
     Precomp  ns ns     IOCHRDY not drivenIDE drive controls IOCHRDY

 Other cards  didn't check brand  Serial Parallel adapter
 	      Logitech Bus Mouse adapter
 	      Roland MPUcompatible MIDI interface 
 		Configured with default IRQ  mem address 

I opened up the box and removed all the other cards above  No help there
Then not having anything better to try I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed
IRQ on the disk controller didn't make any difference and IOCHRDYnot
driven to IDEdrivecontrolsIOCHRDY also had no effect  So I put 
everything back to the way it was and reinstalled the cards

I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller  Voila
the PC booted from power up although it seemed to take several seconds 
before the first access to the hard disk  Plug the floppy cable back
to the controller and the original nonboot behavior returns

OK with this additional information does anyone in netland have any 
words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it

Larry still unplugging away Byler

In the latest PC Magazine Pentium isssue there 
is an editorial on the
advantages of a PC using EISEVESALB rather
than just plain ISAVESALB Supposedly users
will eventually want more than Mb of RAM
However since the ISA bus has only  bits 
then anything on the bus can access only Mb
even if I have Mb on the motherboard
So far I agree with the arguments

Then the writer claims that glitches can
occur in systems with over Mb because 
of that limit That part I don't understand
because the RAM is right on the motherboard
So the cpu should have no problems talking
with the RAM Can anybody explain this 

The problem is with ISA busmasters which
can only address the first MBs of system
memory  Busmasters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM

  It looks like everything works as advertised but I am disappointed
  with the speed  I'm using an Intel  internal k modem in the PC
  with Telebit k on the Unix end which are currently limited to
  Kbits by the Unix com link To get a quantitative comparison I
  did 'cat file' where file is  kbyte uncompressed ascii text and
  it took  seconds to scroll through an X window over the modem link
   charssec  Using the identical hardware and ProcommFW the same
  cat file' takes  seconds  charssec  BTW I use NCD PC XView
  on my PC at work HP every day for the same Unix access from a PC over
  a LAN and like that just fine  The same 'cat file' scrolls by in
   seconds on the LAN connection

I just tried a few experiments I cat'd a byte file  lines
under various scenarios

PCXview for DOS in a fullscreen OS window xx     sec
Telix DOS in an OS window xsx                   sec
Telix DOS is a fullscreen OS window standard VGA         sec
Telix DOS in a Windows  window xx              sec
UWWIN in a seamless OS window xx        gave up after  min
UWWIN in Windows  xx           faster but gave up after  min
UWWIN in a seamless OS window using pg        sec could have been a
                                                little faster I had to keep
                                                hitting the space bar

I was using an ATI Wonder XL video card by the way

So PCXview for DOS looks pretty good and the linebyline scrolling
in OS desktop looks pathetic although fullpage redraws are pretty
good

I tried it under PCXview using my normal xbold or x font
and with a very small font and there was no difference in the times
The modem receive light was on pretty solidly so it looks like the
bottleneck was the baud modem not the screen drawing

Hello

	I have a sx ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS  Currently I have  
 megabytes of RAM installed via eight  MG SIMMS on the motherboard ie  
both banks are full and there is no space for more SIMMS  I am thinking  
of running OS on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows and I know  
that more RAM would be helpful  However with SIMMS the only solution I  
can see is to sell my  Megs for about  and by  mg SIMMS for about  
 used Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now  
the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  
the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  
avoid

So my question is do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  
well with a  ISA machine I have seen some being sold used for about  
 with  Mg with space for another Mg's  If these boards do work how  
do they do it  Is a device driver needed or will the BIOS pickup the  
extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board I know that the  
ISA expansions slots are bits and  SIMM memory is  bits so  
probably all of this is just wishful thinking However any help is truly  
appreciated

Eric

 try a bios level format via the debug command
 Gxxxx  where xxxx is the Hex address of the hd controller bios
 location
 if this will not work a last resort would be to take a large magnet
 to the hard disk but this has to be done properly or you will cause
 or could cause more damage than has been done already

 disclaimer I am not responsible for your actions by directly applying
 a large magnet to your hard disk

 if done correctly the magnet trick will wipe out everything on the
 hard disk COMPLETELY and a low level BIOS format might succeed

 Hi fellow netters
 
 I have a question for you I am gonna buy a DX MHz
 with VESA LocalBus IS the speed benefit that great  
 Would it be wise to spend on a localbus system HD controller 
 and graphic card for normal use  I mean I won't use it for a
 server  
 
 Also I read an article from someone  sorry I can't remember your
 name  and he said that even though you have a localbus harddisk
 controller your performances won't be that much greater because
 of the disk's throughtput  
 So what is the use of having a fast bus if the peripherals can't 
 cope with it 

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for

V for Video  the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory

Since there are usually  VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two 

How about an VLB ethernet card Move the data into the card at
 odd MBs and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over Mbs

 Do do however free the local bus for other cards 

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't

 
 Thank you

 Another good thing I have read in the midst of all the Gateway horror
 stories 

If you were selling as many systems as fast as GW you'd end up with four
or five pissedoff customers too  And four or five ecstatic ones  And lots
of satisfied ones

 they have an excellent return policy

Don't minimize this if you buy mail order it's a good thing to know that
you'll get replacements parts no questions asked in a day or two via FedEx

 They're very impressive systems when they work

Which they do in the vast majority of cases  Remember that it's only the
people on the tails of the curve who are motivated to write  the ones who
love it and the ones who hate it  You don't hear from the folks in the
middle very often

They have rough edges no doubt about it but they give good value per dollar
and use almost all topquality components

This doesn't answer the original question  IS OS a multiuser OS
And no mention was made of an ether card either  But from a diskdata
point of view why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi
tasking  Data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive  Can
SCSI find it faster  can it get it off the drive and into the computer
faster  Does it have a better cache system  I thought SCSI was good at
managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached  If we are
only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive
You are making the same mistake I did you are confusing the DRIVE
interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface  Again from my Mac  IBM info
sheet available by FTP on sumexaimstanfordedu  in the
infomacreport as macibmcomparetxt
Expansion
Both Mac  IBM
SCSI only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM
 Allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner Nubus card 
 expansion Mac Plus only some monitors and CDROM  Apple developed some 
 specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller 
 specifications which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines  
 Main problem  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM 
SCSI   devices per SCSI controller  bit asynchronous MBs ave
 and synchronous MBs max transfer base  bit SCSI requires a
 SCSI controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI not wide SCSI
 which are both bit interfaces see SCSI
SCSI  devices per SCSI controller in SCSI mode  SCSI is fully
 SCSI complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI since it 
 needs a different controller interface in both hardware which tends to be 
 very expendsive and software  Transfer speeds are MBs with MBs burst 
 bit MBs with MBs burst bit and MBs with MBs burst
 bitwide and fast  SCSI in SCSI mode is limited to  devices and
 reduced bit or bit fast only throughput due to the difference between
 SCSI and wide SCSI ports

IBM
HD Interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development

IDE  Integrated Device Electronics 
 currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives Can have more than one hard drive Asynchronous Transfer MBs max

So at its LOWEST setting SCSI interface in Asynchronous SCSI mode AVERAGES 
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode  In full SCSI mode
it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can
The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI comes from  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI through put  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI which would reduce its
cost is unwarented and so SCSI is expencive That is the effect of the
Rule of Scale the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost

SCSI allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while
IDE itself limits the through put

    One company wanted  more for a local bus video card Is this normal
    

Hard Drive
    Segate Western Digital Conner all have the same price Which one is
    more liable which one has better performace

Casepower supply
    Given the choise of desktop and minitower which one is better
    What is the adequate power supply
    Is cooling a general problem or a nonissue

How about MBs for bit VLB or MBs for QuickRing Apple's
implimentation of VLB Byte  QuickRing is interesting in that
it allows interleaving with other card so that the MBs can be divided 
among many cards at the same time NuBus  and MCA are about the only card 
interfaces able to DO anything with that kind of speed and even NuBus 
ditzes around at MBs with a burst mode MBs
MCA Also called Micro Channel
 IBM's  and bit bus allows use of more than one CPU in a computer 
 DCT and anything can talk to anything as fast as the two components 
 involved can handle it Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA 
 and EISA  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC  Carl Jabido

IDA can't handle VLB speed never mind QuickRings's speed so it is out
EISA pokes along at NuBus Mac II speeds MBs burst mode MBs
 so VLB and QuickRing are slowed down by it
PCI is a competing interface that is still in development

Is it my understanding that the EISA board should be able to handle IRQ 
conficts when running windows
 
	Problem  When running our network via telnet tcpip with windows
	running the system kicks us out of windows IRQ confict within windows
	I assume
 
Also are there any memory address problems that will happen when the 
boards are switched base memory that is
 
 As far as I know if you are using EISA mother board you have to use also
 EISA cards or else your computer system will be slower than when you're
 using ISA board with ISA cards
 							Bill


That's nonsense  You can use ISA cards in an EISAsystem without problem
and at the same speed as in an ISA system

A hard drive with XTtype controller can be added but I recommend not trying a
full height   hard drive as I have run into trouble with the w
supply not having the oomph to spool up those big heavy platters

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a  watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed but it manages
when booting is finished plug in your floppy drive now it will work

ok I know this is not very user friendly maybe you are better off
buying a  with  watt power supply or something like that

I am looking for a way to access the floppy drive at the IO level that
is lower than the BIOS  Given the port assignments what controller

also like to be able to write code that works on K disks as well
Also with the method of access is it possible to actually read the
individual bytes on the track as they stream into the controller  I'm
afraid the sector handling is done purely through hardware

If on the off chance I can get this basic on the access anything to
point me in the right direction would help a lot

there is a file out there look for it with archie that is called
'therefzip' which has lots of info on various PC things
amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller
commands I think hard drive controller commands are not there

it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps sector
headers etc   by setting sector size to something very large like

You need the  BIOS which has support for ROM BIOS extensions such
as the ROM on a hard disk controller

A  MB hard card available for not much over  will do the trick
if you have the proper BIOS date Use Norton SI or similar program to
find out
you also need to set the correct switch settings on your xt

I was recently loaned an older Dec   at work and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Harddrive to the machine  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well and is working fine
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the masterslave
relationship necessary for a c d drive setup

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 

The drives themselves are both model number WDA circa 
They are  cyl  head drives  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios but it seems to work at a
setting   cyl  head  writepre  landing zone
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the masterslave  Originally the drive in the machine
had none  Currently I was suggested to try the far right looking at the
back for master and the middle jumper for the slave

When booted the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d drive  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive but then gives the error  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive I
would not even know how to do that

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated  If not a number
for Western Digital might just do as good

   systems go beyond the VESA local bus standard in order to provide DX
   systems with a local bus slot capability  I have definitly seen a
   mother board with  local bus slots which claimed to be able to

You will need to check with peripheral makers to see if their boards

I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread either pro or con but
my spleen could use a little venting  The scenario

	  Ordered a DX w Ultrastor F Local Bus HD controller
	  Receive system  days after ordering Happy
	  Discover Ultrastor F ISA HD Controller inside unhappy
	  Call Gateway receive the correct controller in  days 
		getting happier
	  New controller doesn't work unhappy again
	  Call Gateway again get another controller in  more days
			cooling off the end is in sight
	  This controller doesn't work either motherboard is bad
		VERY unhappy

Gateway's solution  They will order me a new motherboard  more days
	and have onsite service install it for me
BUT I have to take a day off of work because the service people
only work  Mf  I say no way I've already blown about  hours
with this about  of them on hold and I don't have the time or 
to take a day off work  Also my  day return period is almost over and
I've only been able to use the thin for about  minutes  So the whole 
thing is going back  
  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me
that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system but also
the two hard drive controllers they had sent me  Fortunately I just spoke
to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything
up gratis The only downside is that now I have to order another computer

I would really like to try Gateway again I'm just very turned off by the
prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support
again  I think their products are great for the most part but I'm
beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation
Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact  I know Gateway is
booming and for good reason but I don't know if I can take it again
Oh well I feel better now

Hello

I have recently suffered from various problems concerning
an Adaptec A controller

Problem 
Floppy disk drive doesn't work There's apparently at least two jumpers
on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive Unfortunately I
have located only one of them in the lower front corner I would like
to know if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they 
are located

Problem 
My hard disks refuse to boot With my two SCSI HD's Rodime Miniscribe
I get a message 'Missing operating system' even though the disks have been
formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating
system on them If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting
the MSDOS version information This might of course be due to incombatible
memory drivers
Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors

	Thanks in advance

Hello folks

I have an Archive XL internal QIC tape drive which is pretty
comparable to the Colorado Jumbo   Since I have two floppy drives in
my system I'm using a small card not accelerated made by Archive to 
attach my tape drive as a third floppy device

The problem Although the DOSbased QICstream software works just fine
both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless
I switch the machine to nonturbo speed I'm using a DX EISA  Since
the DOS software works it can't be a hardware problem can it  Has anyone
seen similar problems  Any solutions  Thanks in advance

My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ  which is unreserved

I also use IRQ   But there is one disadvantage  Some games assume that

What is the recommended monitor for XGA Can I just use any old sVGA 
monitor or is something more needed Mostly curious before I go blowing
a monster wad of cash on a new system

XGA or XGA  For the original XGA you just need something that can do
x at Hz interlaced just tell them  compatible and they
should get the idea  For the XGA get what you like  I prefer multi
syncs like the IBM  the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like
my home Viewsonic   I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them
in modes like xxk colors noninterlaced or at higher modes like
xx

I have definitly seen a
mother board with  local bus slots which claimed to be able to
support any CPU including the DX and DX  Can someone throw
some more informed light on this issue

Michael Hamilton

Some motherboards support VL bus and DX CPU  There is an option
BIOS I think where additional waits can be added with regard to
CPUVL bus transactions  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives
the VL bus devices time to 'do their thing'  These particular waits
are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus devices  You want to
enable these waits only if you are using a DX with VL bus devices

This is from reading my motherboard manual and these are my interpre
tations  Your mileage may vary

Strictly speaking VL and mhz are not compatable  And there is at
least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work

 Attention voters

 I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting
 Please check the Vote Acknowlegement ACK at the end of this CFV
 If your nameaddress is not there please send your vote again
 Actually check even if you voted after the first day


Introduction

	This is the third and final Call For Votes CFV for the creation
	of four OS newsgroups and the renaming of one
	a  create compososprogrammerporting     unmoderated
	b  renaming of compososprogrammer to
	     compososprogrammermisc               unmoderated
	c  composossetup                         unmoderated
	d  compososmultimedia                    unmoderated
	e  compososbugs                          unmoderated

	This is the second attempt at creating compososprogrammerporting
	and composossetup and renaming compososprogrammer to
	compososprogrammermisc  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of  the voting deadline was August    The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period in this case it is March  
	This is the first attempt at creating compososmultimedia and
	compososbugs

	This document contains
	  the background showing the need for these proposals
	  the proposed charters for these proposals
	  voting instructions
	  a voting ballot
	  some example ballots
	  the voting rules
	  the voting schedule
	  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background

	The creation of two free bit compilers for OS x gcc
	and emxgcc read compososprogrammer for details has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms such
	as emacs less awk grep sed xscheme ispell flex yacc and
	much more  Borland has released its CC compiler for OS x
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS and
	later Windows  As more people are discovering OS x the
	number of people asking questions about OS's compatibility
	with their hardware increases as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware installation
	procedures etc

	Multimedia is becoming popular  OS  supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using WinOS   Furthermore IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS starting with version
	 in addition to using WinOS 

	Any nontrivial software will have bugs  OS is not exempt
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS
	So far IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	eg  the Service Pak for free free from BBSs and ftp sites or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes  read
	compososmisc for details


Proposed Charters

	a  create compososprogrammerporting unmoderated

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts avoid duplication of effort and
		spur additional development  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms such as DOS
		Windows UNIX etc toolkits which aid in program
		portability including porting tools such as Mirrors and
		so forth

	b  rename compososprogrammermisc unmoderated

		To keep the structure of the OS newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal compososprogrammer should be renamed to
		compososprogrammermisc

		compososprogrammermisc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS in an unmoderated setting

	c  create composossetup unmoderated

		It will be devoted to OS system setup topics including the
		availability of device drivers compatibility information
		installation procedures system requirements and overall
		performance optimization

	d  create compososmultimedia unmoderated

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multimedia issues

	e  create compososbugs unmoderated

		It will provide a forum for OS system bug reports bug
		diagnosis and work arounds the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks and so forth

		Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups and discussion of bugs in OS betas belong in
		compososbeta

	  recent vote will be counted

	 Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting  Proxy voting
	  forwarding posting votes to a newsgroup etc will not be counted

	 Do not ask how the votes are going  The status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes

	 I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement ACK  I will
	  post the ACK twice see Schedule below

	 If you need help for using your editor using email how
	  voting works in general etc then ask an expert at your site

	      YES  NO  max  NO
	  where max returns the highest number given to it


Schedule

	The voting period started on March  when the first CFV was posted
	by David Lawrence the newsannouncenewgroups moderator

I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for  that will do
x noninterlaced which seems like a good deal However it is
a fixedscan rate monitor and only handles  kHz horizontal I
think With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes e and 
 not much use since just about any application will set the mode to
something else especially if it wants to do text I suppose Anyway

  is there any way that I can use this as a generalpurpose VGA
   display with a meg trident C card

  if not can I do so with some sort of different VGA card

While rummaging through a box of old PC  parts I found a halfsize

has a copyright date of  on it  The board provides a male pin connector
and has  jumpers of  pins each two labelled A B C  I plugged it into my PC
and ran Advanced diagnostics several times changing the jumper positions each
time but the system did not recognise a comm port

Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it
I could use another comm port if it's free

point of view why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi
tasking  Data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive  Can
SCSI find it faster  can it get it off the drive and into the computer
faster  Does it have a better cache system  I thought SCSI was good at
managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached  If we are
only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive

IDE  Integrated Device Electronics 
 currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives Can have more than one hard drive Asynchronous Transfer MBs max

Why don't you start with the specsheet of the ISA bus first
You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face but if they
exceed the ISA bus capability then what's the point

Who says IDE is limited to  megssec  What about VLBIDE  Does anyone
know how they perform

So at its LOWEST setting SCSI interface in Asynchronous SCSI mode AVERAGES 
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode  In full SCSI mode
it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can

As implimented on what system  

The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI comes from  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI through put  

Given the original question SCSI used only as a single hard drive
controller  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
at least  maybe  megssec for the SCSI choice to make any sence
What does a  meg  megssec SCSI drive cost

The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI which would reduce its
cost is unwarented and so SCSI is expencive That is the effect of the
Rule of Scale the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost

The original CGA cart back in ' was   I think the original EGA card
or PGA was   SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or name your favorite unix workstation  That is after millions
of PC buying decisions over the years SCSI has had plenty of time to
come down in price

I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented
data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OS's when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive

Hi
	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with MB of DRAM  It is an S
c based card  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video and thanks to Orchid I got a fix
from their tech support it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say Buy the memory
from us or something like that

	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
xxk color mode on the thing either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that given MB
of memory  All the MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is xx
Just ONE more mode  GEEZ  Had I known I wouldn't have bothered  I
asked them why and all I got was Your point is well taken but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects

	So to get to the point finally ARE there any s c
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes  I'd love to
get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken

	If you want these modes steer away from Orchids s c
cards ie VLB or VAVLB at least until their developers are less
busy  If the magazines are to believed I've only seen one s c
product thus far which can handle xxk color Genoa
although evenn that might be a misprint

	Please if there are generic or semigeneric drivers out
there let me know where I can get them  xxk is OK but I
coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL

Thanks

S There is one param in the bios setup that says AT BUS CLK  I have
clock which is beyond ISA specs but may be ok if all of the cards can 
run that fast  I would set it to   in fact I did  and set it back if 
anything acts weird  eg you get unexplainable floppy drive errors your 
modem locks up you have video problems etc   If you overdrive the AT 
bus then that should be the first thing to check if you get an error on 
your system  

It is pretty safe to overdrive your AT bus as long as your ISA cards 
still work flawlessly  I suggest backing up your HD before playing with 
it though

On my DX really  not DX my AT bus is set to CLK

At  MHz I have no problems  Soundblaster Pro Zoom  FXM RLL
controller etc  All work fine

If I set it to   MHz I simply don't get past the POST routines

I doubt you could actually damage much by playing with it

 My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ  which is
 unreserved in contemporary computers using IRQ  for the
 drives went out with the XT architechture  

Not completly true  For AT class and later machines IRQ is
reserved for LPT  Since it's rare to have a second parallel
port in a PC it's usually a good safe choice if you need an
interrupt

On the other hand we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a Gateway computer DXV  It has a Modem on COM
a Mouse on COM and the other serial port was set to COM which
normally uses the same interrupt as COM  We had a real fight
with a board when trying to use IRQ and discoverd the problem
was that Gateway had set it up such that COM used IRQ  As soon
as we disabled COM our problems went away  Grumble  after
several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work

very slowly  This also happens when I iconify an application

The HiColor card is advertised as a fasterthanstandard video card but it
does not have an accelerator chip on it  I am running at xxk  Is this
slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip or is there
something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of

    Recently when I run the Norton Disk surface test I realize a slow

be checked at the speed that usually is  As the surface test scaned
half way through my harddisk a tremendous slow down occured  The
expected time for operation will jump from  to  minutes  I try to use
some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to
my harddisk and report always turn out to be none  The surface test
only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the
original speed after it gets over the section  I am wondering whether
it is a harddisk problem or some other problems Anyway help or comment

This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway I am in
the process of purchasing an EISAVL Bus  DX computer and I
found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the
same price The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard that's
the brand of the motherboard with OPTI chip set the other is Micron
formerly Edge Technology and they use the Micronics EISAVLB
motherboard

I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that
Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never
heard of Cache I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because
my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines
and they have good tech support  hr  dayswk and a better
warrantee  years  Micron on the other hand seems to have
recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should
trust the company

I would REALLY appreciate any input on this Is the Micron machine the
clear choice  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about
either company Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards Should I
go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard etc

Thanks very much in advance for any information

I've just installed a new Colorado Jumbo  tape backup unit from
Gateway and I have a couple of complaints with it  I don't know how
common or serious these problems may be  I would appreciate some
feedback from others who have used this system  BTW This is on a
DXV tower system

	I have a similar configuration Colorado mb on  DX tower

The problems are

    o	Firstly Gateway shipped me only  Mb tapes even though the
	drive is a  Mb unit  When I called to complain they only
	said  That's all we carry and With compression you can
	fit  Mb on one tape  Maybe so but then why did I pay
	extra for the large capacity tape drive

	You got suckered in the same way I did  Silly me believing
	that the  logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity
	The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it 
	marketing  Lawyers who prosecute it call it fraud
	Perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on 
	their corporate headquarters

    o	I have about  Mb of data on my C drive  I choose the
	spaceoptimizing compression scheme and started a full backup
	The software estimated it would take about  minutes  It
	took   hours  Does this sound about right

	This is a bit long  My system takes about  minutes to do 
	the same thing  Usually  hours particularly if the tape 
	is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for 
	the write is too small  Is there any way to change the block 
	size or write buffer size so it's bigger

    o	During the backup about a dozen files came up with access
	denied errors  Most of these were in CWINDOWSSYSTEM
	COMMDRV KEYBOARDDRV SHELLDLL etc but also
	CWINDOWSPROGMANEXE and a couple of files in the CTAPE
	directory  Anyone else had this happen

	This is because the files are opened by DOS  The files in the 
	TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration

  When I look at a magazine ad that says

  what exactly do the numbers mean  ie  which is the MB ns
 
 The numbers   and  refers to nanoseconds Could someone explain
 exactly what this numbers means Time spent bettwen processor's request
 and answer retrieved in case of reading 
 
 It means the time required for the memory to refresh  ie a x
 needs ns before it is ready to be read again

Nope It's the time taken to read data from memory It's the read time
The memory will still have to be refreshed The whole phase is called
a cycle the cycle time being about twice the access time

I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your post but DRAM does not have to
be refreshed on each access cycle  So cycle time does not have to be
twice the access time because of refresh phase

The access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw
address strobe RAS to data bus driven

DRAM access cycle timing chart can be roughly shown as following some
signals are intentionally omitted

ADDR RACARACA RARaw Address CAColumn Address
RAS  		High Low Floating
CAS  		driven either H or L
DATA VALIDVALID
         
           
                 cycle time
            access time or RAS access time

Yes the cycle time is more than twice as the access time but not
because of the refresh phase  The refresh can be done either as a
trailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle

 Since your IOcard only has one serial port  this should default to COM

 When you set two 'devices' onto the same IRQ  like COM and COM or  and

Hi

I'm kind of new at the pc stuff  My machine has  serial ports  Com  and

If Answer is NO should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different  And
does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too

What does a  meg  megssec SCSI drive cost
Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with MBs and Hard drives START
at MB I have NO idea
For the Mac I have the following These are ALL external
 MB  MB
 MB  MB
 MB  MB
MB  MB
MB MB
MB  MB
MB  MB
etc

So scsiSCSI for the Mac goes down in priceMB as hard drive size goes
up and I assume the same for the PC world

I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented
data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OS's when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive
Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface  In the Mac since SCSI is THE
inteface for any noncard nonmodem notkeyboard device the id  is used
for the floppy drive called CPU in all identifiers  This allows cross
drive interfacing as fast as the OS program CPU SCSI and drive can handle 
itthis shows up best in the Quatra line
In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well
Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers scanners expandsion cards 
this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage' CDROM etc
IDE seems to be mainly hard drives  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any
and I can't find any  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface
Make of that what you will
SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE
This alone puts SCSI above IDE  SCSI blows IDE out of the water
Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about  months ago
When the Mac prices came down to Earth so the Rule of Scale still played
and SCSI remained high costcheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end
computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI
off into the statosphere price wise
SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the
standard for the most part  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it
choose SCSI  In bit and bit mode SCSI is a multitasking OS desined
interface while IDE and bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces
at least the way mac use bit SCSIUGH

Hi

from the serial cardfloppyide controller I booted up changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a drive as the  and the b drive as the 
The drive lights didn't come on and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives

I switched the cables back to their original positions and then bootedup and
restored the original CMOS settings The lights for the floppies came on
during this process and they stay on for as long as the computer is on
I see that when there is a disk in a the drive is spinning yet there seems
to be no disk access MSDEXE and Norton SI detect both drives but when I 
try to get detailed information about a or b Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive

Can anyone offer any suggestions
I'm in desperate need of help

SCSII ranges from MBs

Hi

    I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec B
and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo  tape drive

    I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI
drive and an existing IDE drive  however when I went to restore the backups
from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow estimated time  mins
actual time  min I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE
drive

    I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to 
enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any
mention of it in the manuals

 My system config is
   iDX Mb 
   Adaptec B running Mb Fujitsu SCSI
   IDE Controller running Mb IDE
   Jumbo  running off floppy controller on IDE

  Any help would be appreciated 

   Thanks

It depends on what you'd like your joystick for  I've seen Gravis
joysticks at Radio Shack  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my
hand  I have heard on csipgames that they don't last well less than
a year on flightsims  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick

I recently purchased a CH Flightstick  There aren't any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick 
I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron  Works
quite well  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free  The buttons provide good tactile response you can hear
and feel them well  There are other models made by CH that can go up or
down in features

For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for  here
compared to the  I paid for a CH Flightstick  I think the extra
 is worth it just in feel  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy

Just another note analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch  If you're only playing games such as Castle
Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input ie only up
down left etc instead of 'how much right' you might want to look into
a Gravis gamepad  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know
much beyond that

Can anyone tell me if this card works with the March OS  beta

 I believe so since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very 
reliable in OS 

Where do I get OS drivers

 Endusers not OEM manufactures will get all the software package with the
card which includes drivers for Novell OS Unix  Xenix and so forth

Does this card work with the Toshiba B cdrom in DOS or OS

 Definitely

Here is my setup
quantam SCSI hd
toshiba B cdrom

I'm considering the B because I have been told BusLogic's support is 
better than Adaptecs and that the B performs better than the C
Anyways I just want to know if the B will work in OS  DOS with my
above peripheals

 Windows  enhanced mode

     The Windows  install program should automatically configure DOS
and Windows for use with the Adaptec   However just in case
something went wrong I'm going to describe some of the changes needed
to get Windows  working with the   Also you may have noticed
that installing Windows  makes your PC run much slower even when
you're not running Windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called Windows  runs slowly


 MSDOS configuration

     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your
CONFIGSYS and AUTOEXECBAT files  If you follow the instructions
you'll notice that you'll need to use doublebuffering with SmartDrive
this is the default setup  You'll also notice that your system runs
much much slower  in both Windows AND MSDOS  See the section
called Windows  runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system
up


 Windows configuration

     To get the Adaptec  to work with Windows make sure that the
Enh section of the SYSTEMINI file contains the entry

	VirtualHDIRQOff

I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry
to SYSTEMINI but I'm not sure  If this doesn't work for you you
might want to try adding some more lines

	VirtualHDIRQOff
	SystemROMBreakPointfalse
	EMMExcludeACFFF

You probably don't need the above lines though  The
SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like QEMMMAX only needed if you use such programs


 Windows  runs slowly

     Once you do get Windows  running with the  chances are that
your system is running much slower than before  If it's not it's
probably because

      You happen to be using ASPIDOSSYS version  in your
	CONFIGSYS file  Congratulations  this appears to be a
	winning solution

      You are very lucky  Whether your luck will hold out remains to
	be seen 

If your system is running much slower than before this is almost
definitely caused by Smartdrive with doublebuffering  According to the
Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note Q
SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPIDOSSYS you must use
Smartdrive with doublebuffering enabled  While this works it really
slows down your PC I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a
factor of  FIVE  As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other
solutions

     Unfortunately you cannot just disable doublebuffering  If you
do Windows  in enhanced mode will not work and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 
What you can do is one of the following

      Use other drivers that provide doublebuffering  It is my
	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused
	either by horribly inefficient doublebuffering or by a bug in
	Smartdrive

      Use a driver that provides VDS services VDS stands for
	Virtual DMA Services  This is a standard which is supported
	by Windows  that allows busmastering disk controllers like
	the  to work with Windows

     After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following
solutions none of which require using Smartdrive note however that I
am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably NOT caused
by these solutions but might be  see below  While the following
does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster

 If you do not have the ASPIDOSSYS driver or you do not need ASPI
   functions for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two
   physical hard disks etc you can add the SCSIHASYS driver to your
   CONFIGSYS file eg

	DRIVERcSCSIHASYS V

   Windows needs the V option  This driver MUST be loaded into
   LOW memory it cannot be loaded into high memory and it occupies
   about K  As of November  the SCSIHASYS driver could be
   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at  hopefully it's
   still there

 If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPIDOSSYS driver version
    or a you can use both the ASPIDOSSYS and SCSIHASYS drivers
   in your CONFIGSYS file eg

	DRIVERcASPIDOSSYS
	DRIVERcSCSIHASYS V

   Amazingly enough the SCSIHASYS driver can also be loaded high
   assuming you have DOS  I would have thought that this would
   crash my system but it doesn't  I asked Adaptec's technical support
   about this and they said that loading SCSIHASYS high should be fine
   as long as ASPIDOSSYS is loaded LOW

   On my system NOT using SCSIHASYS with ASPIDOS a would
   occasionally cause Windows  to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk some of my
   CWINDOWSGRP files would be corrupted  For me these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMANEXE
   the default Windows shell and viceversa  This is the reason
   SCSIHASYS may be necessary

   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHASYS is necessary with versions of
   ASPIDOS earlier than 

   Note that many people can use ASPIDOS  or a without
   SCSIHASYS they do not seem to have any problems at all  I consider
   these people lucky  Others like me have had all sorts of problems

 In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is
   to upgrade to ASPIDOS   The SCSIHASYS driver is no longer
   needed  Unfortunately while you could get previous ASPIDOS
   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the ASPIDOS  driver is not
   available from the Adaptec BBS  As far as I know there are only
   three ways to get a copy

       You can buy the new as of November  Adaptec EZ SCSI driver
	kit which supposedly includes ASPIDOS  as well as other
	drivers such as CDROM drivers  I believe the list price is
	around 

       If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPIDOS you
	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for
	around 

       A copy of ASPIDOS  is included in Central Point PC Tools 
	for MSDOS  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories  Note further that only ASPIDOS is
	included the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two
	hard disks are not included  This is where I obtained my copy
	of ASPIDOS 

Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with
Windows  In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing
this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above
solutions  However because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the
parity errors are driverrelated for example changing the bus onoff
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this  I've run various
memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no
problems  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers
this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems  the problems
show up only under disk IO  However I'm mentioning this just in case
it isn't a hardware problem


 Floppycontrollerbased tape backup devices

     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec  with a
floppycontrollerbased tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory
Systems Jumbo 

 Tape backupsrestores can take a very long time  The tape drive
   constantly starts stops starts stops etc

 Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors
   This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 
   However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so
   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
   


 Tape backupsrestores take a long time

     If you have a floppycontrollerbased tape backup device you may
have to adjust the Adaptec  bus onoff timing for best
results when using the tape drive  Normally while doing a tape backup
or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with
only an occasional pause  However the default bus timing on the
Adaptec  may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop
start and stop every few seconds  This causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this  make sure your tape heads are clean
This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer
than necessary

     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to
transfer data in memory tofrom the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA
to transfer data in memory tofrom the hard disk  The floppy DMA needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops
rewinds a bit and restarts once enough data is eventually fed to it
The default bus timing on the Adaptec which is really DMA timing is
too large  For example when a backup is done data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the
tape  Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too
much too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive  As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops
because data is not fed to it quickly enough

     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus onoff timing  The
default factory setting is  microseconds on and  microseconds off
The bus on timing needs to be lowered to  microseconds  This can
be done in one of two ways

 If you have ASPIDOS you can use the n option  For example I use
  a bus on timing of  microseconds which means that I use the
  following line in my CONFIGSYS file

	DEVICEcaspidossys n

  Note that there is NO space between the n and the 

 If you don't have ASPIDOS your only recourse is to try to find a
  program called SETSCSIEXE which is very difficult to find  The
  reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to
  want this widely distributed  I once asked someone who worked for
  Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere  If you have
  anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to
  hunt down a copy I believe that there are a couple of sites that have
  it  If you do find a copy you run it like so

	setscsi n

  This adjusts the bus on timing to  microseconds  Running
  SETSCSIEXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
  factory defaults

  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSIEXE if you use
  ASPIDOS SETSCSIEXE crashed my system if ASPIDOS was loaded  I
  could use SETSCSIEXE with SCSIHASYS however

Do not lower the bus on timing below  microseconds or increase it
above  microseconds  If you lower it too low the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower  For me 
microseconds works fine  This value may work fine for you or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little

     Once you've lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores
should run faster

     Also do not experiment with the bus onoff times with the other
options that I have intentionally not described unless you know what
you are doing  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by
starving memory refresh

     A program called BUSTIFIXEXE exists on the Adaptec BBS  Unless
this has been upgraded since I last checked which has been a while
this is a selfextracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus onoff times for the  and others  However when I tried
running this program with my A my system crashed  At the time I
was running SCSIHASYS and I didn't check to see if there was a
conflict with it  Maybe this old program works only with the B
although the docs say that it works with the A


 Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors

     This problem may or may not exist  Although it existed on my
system a hardware problem just on my particular  could cause it
However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm
mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my


     Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the
tape head

 Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors
   resulting in an aborted tape backup

 Tape backup works but the tape compare fails

 The tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much too often
   Unlike the abovementioned problem Tape backupsrestores take a
   long time where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds
   this kind of startingstopping occurs every few  seconds or so

 Fastback Plus  does not findsee any tape backup devices  Other
   programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software
   assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo  tape drive can findsee the
   tape drive but Fastback Plus  cannot

 Too many tape read errors

     Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it  A few months ago I
upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy
controller  As I already had a floppy controller on the  I
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller  After a while I
decided to try disabling the  floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard  When I did this the tape drive a CMS Jumbo 
reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus  was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive

     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 
On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the  which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
  On the other hand the tape drive didn't work well attached to
the  floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different
controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
  I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables  I don't know what the cause really is
however if you're having similar problems you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller


 Sound cards

     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and
this is typically done using DMA  Like the tape drive DMA the
Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA  Unlike that of the
tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error
your system crashes with a parity error message  What happens is
that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a
parity error  Usually getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware

     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity eg higher sampling rate recording in stereo
recording using bits instead of  etc

     Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the
Adaptec's bus on timing  See the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done  Note however that this may or may
not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem ie some software is inefficient  Disk caches the
speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this


 Miscellaneous info

     This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors  Much
of it is merely information that I've heard or read about and have not
verified  I believe that the following information is correct but I'm
not sure  Use it at your own risk

 With QEMM   and  you need to specify the DB
  parameter eg DB unless you are using the ASPIDOS driver
  If you don't QEMM will crashhang at bootup  Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that
  a  is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line at least this occurred with the QEMM  install
  program  I haven't tested any other version  Earlier versions of
  QEMM probably need this parameter but I'm not sure I've never used a
  version earlier than 

  If you use ASPIDOS you do not need to give QEMM the DB parameter

 Some or all versions of the  do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size  To support hard disks with capacities over GB you
  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec  I'm not sure if this is
  still true of the latest Bs being sold by Adaptec

 To connect a CDROM drive to the  you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces
  nonSCSI these drives cannot be used with the   You have three
  choices for CDROM drivers I have no idea how well the following
  solutions work or even if they work  the following is secondhand
  information

      You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package which lists for
	something like   If you already have older Adaptec drivers
	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around   Contact
	Adaptec for details  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains
	everything that you need

      You can buy the CorelSCSI driver package which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW  This package contains CDROM
	drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers etc  I do not know
	the list price but I've seen this package sold for around
	  Note that CorelSCSI does not come with the ASPIDOS
	driver which is needed  If you do not already have ASPIDOS
	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead

      This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been
	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit but I'm mentioning it in
	case someone already has these drivers  You can use the
	drivers in the Adaptec ASW kit ASPIDOS and the ASW
	kit ASPI CDROM drivers  You will have to get a copy of
	MSCDEXEXE a highlevel CDROM driver if it is not included in
	the ASW kit but this is available from several bulletin
	boards

 To use a SCSI tape drive with the  you need software that knows
  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive  Software that I've heard about are
  again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how
  well the following solutions work or even if they work  the
  following is secondhand information

      Central Point PC Tools  for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives  It comes with SCSI drivers
	ASPIDOS  as well as Central Point Backup

      The CorelSCSI driver package contains a SCSI tape backup
	program see the above section on CDROM drives for more
	details  However note that CorelSCSI does not come with but
	requires ASPIDOS

 I've seen advertisements that sell the  in three configurations

       SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS
       SCSI controller wBIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers
       SCSI controller wBIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and
	CorelSCSI driversprograms

  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the  in a fourth configuration

       SCSI controller wBIOS and EZ SCSI drivers including ASPI
	drivers

 Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar
  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPIDOS driver you
  need this driver before you can use this program  I've never used
  this version of GNU tar but I've heard that it works I don't know
  how well though  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet
  a copy can be found on wsmrsimtelarmymil and mirror sites

	PDMSDOSDSKUTL
	ASPIBINZIP    Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives Adaptec xx
	ASPIPATZIP    Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 
	ASPISRCZIP   Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape Adaptec ctrlr

  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve UNIXFORUM might
  have it if any forum does

 As far as MSDOS is concerned the A and the B controllers are
  the same with MSDOS the A should work as well as the B
  However the hardware for these two boards is not  identical and
  there is at least one NONMSDOS program that initially did not work
  with a A but did work with a B BSD  a  version of
  BSD Unix

 In case anyone's curious here's an edited copy of my CONFIGSYS file

	FILES
	BUFFERS
	BREAKON
	STACKS
	DEVICEcsysdevaspidossys d n
	DEVICECQEMMQEMMSYS on RAM ROM DMA STM XFFFFF
	DOSHIGHUMB
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevnnansisys
	DEVICEHIGHCDOSSETVEREXE
	shell  cdoscommandcom p

  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPIDOS   If I were using ASPIDOS
   or a I'd probably have to use a CONFIGSYS that looked like

	FILES
	BUFFERS
	BREAKON
	STACKS
	DEVICEcsysdevaspidossys d n
	DEVICECQEMMQEMMSYS on RAM ROM DMA STM XFFFFF
	DOSHIGHUMB
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevscsihasys V
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevnnansisys
	DEVICEHIGHCDOSSETVEREXE
	shell  cdoscommandcom p

  If I weren't using ASPIDOS I'd probably use something that looked
  like

	FILES
	BUFFERS
	BREAKON
	STACKS
	DEVICEcsysdevscsihasys V
	DEVICECQEMMQEMMSYS on RAM ROM DB DMA STM XFFFFF
	DOSHIGHUMB
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevnnansisys
	DEVICEHIGHCDOSSETVEREXE
	shell  cdoscommandcom p

  However if I used a floppycontrollerbased tape drive or if I
  planned to record highquality sound from a sound card I would still
  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus onoff times  The first
  two versions of CONFIGSYS take care of this but this last version
  doesn't

I have a   drive as drive A  How can I make the system boot from
my   B drive  Optimally the computer would be able to boot
from either A or B checking them in order for a bootable disk  But
if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that
it can't boot   disks that's OK  Also bootb won't do the trick
for me

Hello

in the EDN magazine I found a note about the new CT C
IO Controller It support several parallel port protocols
including
	Fast Centronics
	Microsoft Enhanced Capabilities Protocol ECP
	Enhanced Parallel Port EPP
The last two handle data rates up to Mbytessec

Is there any specification about these protocols available

Re Problems with Sinitialization

As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization
of the S card

InitDisplay
	BIOSCall
		with AXReg  FH
		with BXReg  H for  x  x  resolution
		Interrupt H 
Unlock Register Lock  CR
	 For access to S Register Set 
Unlock Register Lock  CR
	 For access to Syst Control and Syst Extension Register 
Unlock Graphic Command Group CR
	 Set Bit  to  in Syst Configuration Register 
Unlock Advanced Display Functions
	 Set Bit  to  in Function Control Register 

After these operations the FIFOstack of the S should be empty
When we watch the status Graph Proc Status we always get
the value FH instead of H
Full would mean FFH  places occupied empty would mean H
 places occupied

It is possible to read this register in two different ways 
Both times we get different results



Our machine is a  DX with EISA bus and a S C local bus 

 any ideas

I have a Maxtor MB on an ISA IDE controller although my machine is
DX VLB I has the save transfer rate of  MBs regardless of
the variations of the ISA bus speed I tested it with speed between
MHz and MHz Not any difference The problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory

My advice Buy Megs of RAM save  and enjoy performance

It's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my
computer already it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of
the  that is sticking out of my old hard disk
I don't know if disk drives for the Apple or Mac are different from ones
used in AT clones so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk
on my AT clone If not what did I just purchase It's a Quantum Prodrive
It's dated  on the green board Will I need a controlleraddin card

 if I can what sw or hw do I need 


I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors I bet your SX has IDE drives The
two are not compatible on the same controller However you might be
able to use the drive with its controller in your SX You should be
able to plug your K drive into your existing SX controller I
think You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT

I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system

 DX  mb of ram
on a Novell  network
Monitor  NEC FGe capable of  Hz vertical refresh rate

Major considerations

I expect I will work mostly in windows but with some DOS
applications and I would want decent speed in DOS  I do mostly word
processing database and communicationsnot much intensive graphics

With a  monitor I expect I will work mostly in X and 
colors seems plenty but I'd like like the image to be sharp fast
and rock solid

Other considerations

I sometimes run a Unix clone Coherent and I understand that some
companies eg Diamond don't encourage the thirdparty
development of drivers

I might move to OS if I decide I need better speed and reliability
than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking

I don't have a local bus motherboardI'm not sure how much to invest
in an ISA video board versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later

I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well

If you have any advice for me I'd love to hear it via email or post

Thanks

I started a similar thread about a month ago and got many replies
The summary

CTX  Nasty low quality Avoid

CTX  Proscan Not as good as some other makes however cheap
  Main problem seems poor quality control Some reported pincushioning
  the problem I had others poor focus etc etc

I complained about mine and it was 'retuned' I dodn't even pay
shipping and returned to me in  days 

It's now clear wellfocussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all I'm very happy with it and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice Certainly a Trinitron
say would be much nicer but that's well out of my price range

Conclusion If you're on a budget get one and be prepared to
send it back if it's not perfect It probably won't be when you get it
but has good potential

 I almost got a hernia laughing at this one
 If anything SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local
 Bus IDE  It must be real nice to get shafted by  bucks for the
 extra cost of a SCSI drive then pay another  for a SCSI controller

First off with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce IDE may no longer be sufficient for me  Mb limit
Second rumor is Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon I'm just not sure if it's on DOS Win or NT
At any rate the deal is with Corel who makes I hear a good
cohesive set of SCSI drivers

Hi
VLB is defined for  cards by MHz
and  cards by MHz

there are designs with MHz and  VLBSlots
s C't   

MHz and  Slots are realy difficult to design

Better OSs OS  iX are able to handle more than MB of DRAM
if you use EISABus
Has someone experience with VLB 
I think of SCSIVLBBusmaster The problem is the bit Floppy DMA

OK thanks to all of you who responded to my post
here's the official response from orchid
Orchid is aware of the problem the new rev of the board rev d SHOULD         not would take care of the problem production was scheduled to start
on april  I have no confirmation that production did start on this day
just the word of the tech on the other line

now the flame
you would think a company like Orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs 
very poor tech support the first  times I called I must have spoke with the
janitor because they where talking craziness the last time I talked to a tech  named paul and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on
until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy
or recommend orchid products

flame off

again thanks to all of you who answered my post

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for

V for Video  the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory


Well not to be picky but the V in VLB stands for VESA
While the V in VESA stands for video saying the V in VLB stands
for video is not entirely correct

Netters

I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask
the netcommunity' I was ordering a Nec CDR but saw so much cheaper
ones that I want to know more
The drive will be used to install software and if available for listening
to CD's Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's but
that's not really relevant at the moment

I've been offered the following CDROM players for the prices stated
They all claim to have SCSII and operate under OS
The drives are not listed in the cdromfaq and therefor please give
your opinions on the drives i've got the impression that they're not
all SCSI Actually the Nec was listed as nonscsi in the cdromfaq and as
a compatible SCSI product in the osfaq

I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times  It's actually
about times 

Mitsumi CRMC     
Philips LMSI    
Philips       
Toshiba         
Nec CDR       

Who bought that Trantor that is in the faq It's extremely cheap and SCSI

I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for
mine to arrive in the mail There seems to be a lot of
complaints about minor alignment problems with the MXF One
article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
and was told that his screen rotation was within spec 

Well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has
a very noticable barrel distortion It's not dramatic but it
is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't
fill the entire screen The fact that it is worse on the right
side doesn't help matters

What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect I don't want
to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
problem Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment 
Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections

Has anyone tried connecting an Apple Laserwriter II to a PC
Do I need any special controller card or software to do that

Basically I'm looking for a  SVGA x noninterlaced

So I thought perhaps I might find something as good for less  Any
recommendations  I also thought about the NEC FGx which has the
same specs as the FG except for the scan frequency which is more
limited anybody have any comments on this one  Would it work with

I believe that NEC is replacing the FG and FGx with FGe and FGe
models reportedly being released at the end of this month  I'm
waiting for a FGe the main difference being a  year warranty and
higher refresh rates at the higher resolutions  It sounded from a PC
Magazine note that the FGe was being boosted in a number of ways
Call the NEC  number and have them send you info

I have been using a NEC FGx for several months now  Several others here 
also have this monitor  We have had no problems  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as  
MHz viz  Mhz  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
FGX vs the  series on a PC running windows at x  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me but you might feel differently  Finally speaking of 
spending money with the size of today's files etc a tape backup is 
certainly worth   Recently I set up a friend's PC Mhz and VESA 
local bus  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of  
faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost

Hi to all you PC gurus

I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently
asked but I don't know the answer  I've been recently having some problems
with my  computer with a Seagate  meg hard drive I occasionally find
corrupted files but most of the time programs work fine Are there any utilities
that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem
is a result of the hard drive vs an illbehaved program or some other hardware
item Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly
aligned etc As might be expected I would greatly appreciate any help on this
matter I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything
and hoping that will fix the problem but I would like to have some assurance
of what the problem cause is 

Also can someone give me an opinion on DOS  Are the compression and
defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have
those routines already as opposed to buying them separately 


Much thanks in advance for any help

I have some used but working parts available for the original IBM
laptop  the PC Convertible  If you have one of these things and
still are using it you may have found out that IBM wants OUTRAGEOUS
prices for parts  I built up a supply of enough parts to keep mine
going for a few years and will be willing to part with the rest

Basically I have all the standard parts EXCEPT

Motherboard
Battery
Power Supply

I've got a few of the accessories too  just ask

These are in very limited supply however  I've basically just cannibalized
a couple of old machines

If you are interested please email me

Note For those who want to convince themselves that they are somehow
superior because they have newer and better machines or who want to
inform me that these are worthless junk save your effort  I'll
just delete the note  Those of us who bought these machines when they first
came out still find them useful for word processing etc  I'm saving
mine as a future antique

ESDI is always MBs although there are some nonstandard versions
The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI
SCSII bit asynchronous MBs ave synchronous MBs max transfer 
base
SCSIfaster this requires a SCSI controller chip and provides
 SCSI bit to bit speeds with SCSI controlers
SCSI MBs with MBs burstbit MBs with MBs burst bit 
and MBs with MBs burstbitwide and fast  bit SCSI can be
wide or fast it depends on how the port is designedThe Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI nonwide port

The article in PC Mag  was talking about SCSI SCSI uses
TEN  devices in it native mode outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI  devices slower through put

From your own figures SCSI is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for  faster then IDE that seems to be bit SCSI using a SCSI 
contoler chip The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI controler chip for its SCSI
and gets MBs through put for asynchronous bit SCSI far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI output  of  is  which is near
the burst of a SCSI machine with a SCSI controller chip

The PC world seems to have SCSI and SCSI mixed up  Fact is SCSI 
controler chips allow near SCSI speeds through a SCSI device
As shown in the Mac Quadra which skews some of the data of SCSI vs
IDE or ESDI test I agree that the article COULD have stated that the 
faster then IDE came off a SCSI device with a SCSI chip  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI NOT SCSI and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI device
with a SCSI controller chip
SCSI chips are limited to MB max  SCSI devices with SCSI chips
becoming common produce up to Mbs in bit mode and MBs in bit
mode the fast version SCSI ports cannot use wide SCSI  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI devices HAVE SCSI chips
or more accurately the machine does This allows the best of BOTH
worlds high SCSI speeds and cheeper SCSI costs FULL SCSI hardware
port electronic controller etc is VERY expensive  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI goes

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about while  DXBpsuvmpsuedu is throwing out
ranges that don't tell SQUAT Since he IGNORES SCSI devices with
SCSI chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended

ESDI is always MBs although there are some nonstandard versions
ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI

SCSI with a SCSI controler chip range is indeed MBs
and that is ALL you have right about SCSI
SCSI With a SCSI controller chip MBs with MBs burst bit
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI
 so it DOES exist Some PC use this set up too
SCSI bitSCSI mode          MBs with MBs burst
SCSI bitwide or fast mode  MBs with MBs burst
SCSI bitwide AND fast     MBs with MBs burst
 
By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct
With a SCSI controller chip SCSI can reach MBs which is indeed
 faster than IDE  of  is  ALL these SCSI facts have been
posted to this newsgroup in my Mac  IBM info sheet available by FTP on 
sumexaimstanfordedu  in the infomacreport as 
macibmcompareversion txt It should be  but  may still be there

Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI chip
an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI chip Not at a MBs
MBs burst it does not SCSI is MBs maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER  It seems that Mac and IBM see
SCSI interface and think 'SCSI' when it maybe a SCSI interface driven
in the machine by a SCSi controller chip in bit mode Which is MUCH
FASTER then true SCSI can go

Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on

 What are the current products available to upgrade the resolution

 I'm planning on producing camera ready copy of homes  Will the higher

If you are talking about laser jet  then I believe it has to be postscript
I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the LJ that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of
handling  dpi specifications  I only have experience with the Laser
Master Winjet  which brings the LJ up to  dpi and it uses postscript
It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript and it is at a lower
resolution dpi I think but it is FAST  This particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript so even with a decent
PC you know it's going to be slow ie slow compared to a highend workstation
processed PS

The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait for
the PS processing  I'm rather impatient

We were using it for BW camera images RS  The gray scale image was
accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript
processor  The postscript is rendered into RAM lots of it and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer  The PS processor can also
accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications but
Windows has to be running at the time of printing  The PS processor is
responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job  Our
camera images came out very good in my opinion  not as good as Laser Master's
demo though

I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be
surprised if there are several

Seagate MFM controller are in the system 

Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future
Domain card But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg
is connected

I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses IRQ  IO
port Have I missed anything

I am lost here Any suggestions are most welcomed Thanks in advance

OK so how do I dissable COM

Read your hardware manual for your IO card  There should be jumper
settings on your card to enabledisable COM ports

Subject Logitech button mouse pinout  BIOS routine availability
Distribution world
Organization Purdue University Engineering Computer Network

I have a Logitech Sf or fS button mouse that I want to
interface to a serial port of a different nonibmcompatible system
The mouse is XTATPS compatible with a DB connector  I tried
to reverse engineer the mouse but it has a microcontroller inside
it

If I could get the DB pinout and perhaps a copy of the BIOS routines
that support it I could map all this into my target system

Anyone know where I might get the pinout or the BIOS routines
Are the routines published someplace convenient

Thanks

We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway  I finally
got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives  The only
reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several
bootable 's and some  based install disks which expected
the A drive  I order all new software and upgrades to be  and
the number of stupid install programs that can't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time  the ones I had are now upgraded  And
as for the bootable 's I just cut  replacements

If switching the drives is not an option you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis  I haven't tried it but I think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully

Does anyone know when they stopped using those Tatung monitors I

That one and it's replacement failed within  months I gave up

 I am looking at purchasing a  system from Zeos computers I would appreciate
 if people could give me some feedback about the quality of their products and

I bought a DX system a little over  years ago and was satisfied with
everything about Zeos  That computer went off to grad school with my son and
I replaced it with a DX pkg   MBHD MB ram with Diamond Viper
K level  cache and tower upgrades delete the CTX monitor  I got a
 HP DA monitor employee purchase  This is a great system fast
quiet solidly built not a single glitch bringing it up  Tech support seems 
busier now than  years ago  I called with a configuration question and
they called back  hours later with the right answer  I think there's a
slight premium over Gateway prices but IMHO Zeos is worth it BTW they 
have enough  lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales
customer service or tech support Now you usually wait  or  minutes to
talk to someone but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime

I am an Amiga owner and tired to have the same graphic modes
So I saw on nn there was a little bridgeboard that made the

The building mother house of this little gadget assure me
that using this thing I can use all the pc boards included
the SVGA cards
I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many

So what is the best ISA slot card on the market 
I'd like to reach resolutions like x with

    Oh yeah I just read in another newsgroup that the Ti uses a
    high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitorsthe Sony
    S for example and this is where the extra cost comes from  It
    is also where the high bandwidth comes from and the fantastic
    image and the large image size etc etc
 
 It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen one a third
 down the other two thirds down come from
 

The  lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube these
 wires will be found on all  trinitron tubes eg Mitsubishi 
Sony  etc  On  Sony tubes you'll find one wire

Their level of annoyance is purely subjective  I'm so happy with the
sharpness of the Ti that I don't even notice the lines

The Ti uses a Trinitron SA tube which when viewed as a complete tube
has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube  This results in 
a flatter screen than other  monitors using the standard trinitron 
which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface and 
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus

 In PC Magazine April   Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI
  faster than IDE and support up to  devices its acceptance has
 long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches
 note what it does NOT site as a factor PRICE

There is a premium of approx  for the controller What is nice is 
being able to run hard disks tape drives cdroms and scanners of
one dma channel and interupt

SCSI makes sense is you are going to load up a machine if you just want
a standard box for Windows then IDE makes sense

I have one loaded box that uses SCSI and run Unix and one standard box
that runs DOSWindows that uses IDE


 By standard I mean   MB RAM MH disk S video 

 int eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI from the
 article it seems you get plug and play SCSI only since SCSI in FULL
 implimentation has TEN NOT  devices

I beleive this last bit is just plain wrong

 SCSI intergration is sited as another part of the MicroSoft Plug and play

I just purchased a Viewsonic  and and Orchid P  In short I am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card  I have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card so that is what I am going to write about  The monitor
is pretty  The moires I had under Simcity on my  Magnavox went away  It
isn't as heavy as I thought it would be  lbs I think  So much for the
monitor  On to the bitch session and test results

In going with the modern trend the Orchid P card only supports  colors
in x mode without a driver  Of course this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes like most of my CDROMs  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA
Orchid Fahrenheit  and Orchid F VLB all share this limitation  Those
are all S cards which means it is an S problem for them the P uses
a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them  The Hercules Graphite
card does seem to have these modes but I didn't run the same test cases as
I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it  It was able to
print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia though which the S
cards just printed as hash which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported

The supported resolutions really annoy me  You can do x at Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC FG they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic' and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL  But at x you are limited to Hz  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do Hz
at  it sure should be able to do it at   Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F VLB I currently have
and it will do xx Hz as well

The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard  I just got off the phone
with Orchid and with the  drivers I don't know what I have he was unable
to recreate the problem  On the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have
the problem  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to  Hz either

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixelssecond  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card but they
were close to half of the OFVLB ie slower but that was running in a MHz
 ISA so the numbers aren't really comparable  The following numbers
were all obtained using a   MHz AIR motherboard UMC chipset with
 MB memory  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them and these tend to jump around a bit


K means thousand not  M means million pixels per second

             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P

The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display  The screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen  Awesome  Interestingly the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie
filled with crosshatching and Ternary Rops whatever they are  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe are a dead loss on the   I give two
numbers for the  fonts because I think they are caching
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly 
 the speed of the OFVLB  Then the speed increases dramatically  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all  Its just what

Hi

I've got a Victor PCXT with a  MB harddisk in it The controller is
a Toshiba MFM controller with an additional  pins connector

There are  busses from my harddisk to this controller One with  wires
and another with  wires

The controller has two connectors for a  wirebus and one for a  wire
bus

Now I got a  MB harddisk from a friend of mine and I wondered whether
I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller there is room
for a  wirebus but not for the  wire bus

How can I solve my problem any suggestions

If you need more info mail me please luttikfwiuvanl

I'd like to add a second S based video card to my system  Does anyone
know of a company that sells a card that can coexist with another one
All I really need is color text on one monitor and fast color graphics
on the other

Probably just a configurable address would do it

Hi

I'd like to switch my floppy drives so that my  b drive becomes a while
my  a becomes b I'm having a few problems though

I know that the ribbon cable must be switched as well as the CMOS settings 
to reflect this change and I think that I've done that correctly However the
drives do not operate correctly in this configuration From the C prompt if 
I type a the  drive light comes on if I type b both the light for the
 and  drives come on

There are some jumpers on each drive
  Label   Original Pos   Pos I changed it to
        DS      ON               OFF
	DS	 OFF		  ON

	IO	 OFF		  OFF

Hi Netters

I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution  After you read about
my situation I'd like your opinion  Here's the scenario

  There are two computers in the house  One is a small  MB IDE drive
    The other is a DX  SCSI drive w Adaptec  controller  Both 
    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup  
    restore program  Both systems have  and  floppies

  The computers are not networked nor will they be anytime soon

From what I have seen so far there appear to be at least  possible
solutions I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about  For these 
options I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees 
any flaws drive type X won't coexist with device Y etc in my thinking 
I don't know very much about these beasts

  Put MB floppy drives or a combination drive on each system
    Can someone supply cost and brand information  What's a good brand
    What do the floppies themselves cost


  Put an internal tape backup unit on the  using my SCSI adapter and
    continue to back up the  with floppies  Again can someone recommend a
    few manufacturers  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories  Any
    happy or unhappy users I know about the compression controversy
 

  Connect an external tape backup unit on the  using my SCSI adapter and
    maybe connect it to the  somehow any suggestions


  Install a Floptical drive in each machine  Again any gotcha's or 
    recommendations for manufacturers  

I appreciate your help  You may either post or send me email  I will
summarize all responses for the net

Thanks

a reasonably safe fashion via polling  And that isn't platform or
clockspeed specific

    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port How
    You send a command to the port to read it then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit  This time
    is proportional to the joystick position  Obviously since time
    is used as a position you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS it
    would speed it up some but the time would still be there

 By my way of thinking Michael how could this memory be static RAM if it
 has a speed rating  I didn't think SRAM needed a refresh time

 Doesn't that make it fast DRAM

This chip would take ns to return valid data after being issued an address

Refresh time none for SRAM as you pointed out is a different parameter
and is not generally referred to except by motherboard designers

until I upgraded by CDROM drive from a Sony CDU to a Sony CDU  I now
find that the audiomode will not work  I assume it is not being handled

So should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade  If so does anyone know their

Hi

I recently switched my  drive to A The problem is while I can read and
write to both the new A and B correctly I can't boot from a floppy in A
I've checked the CMOS settings it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot 
Order AC 

Once I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A I got a
message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive It didn't work
When I do have a systems disk in the A drive this is what happens
 Poweron and Memory Test
 A light comes on
 B light comes on followed by a short beep
 HD light comes on for an instant
 B light comes on again then nothing happens

The light goes off there is no disk activity of any kind and the screen 
blanks I can't even use ctrlaltdel

Any suggestions

Thanks in advance

Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive a Seagate MB
I can look up the model number if it's important and I've been
trying to help him install it  I've got a vested interest since
my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed
He already has a Seagate MB IDE HD again I forget the model number
but I can find out

Anyway I can't seem to get the bloody thing up  I've managed to get
one or the other drive up with the other disconnected but not both
at the same time whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup 
never gets past the system test  The IDE controller's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives I think I've configured the CMOS
correctly the power's plugged in properly I even learned about the
masterslave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have didn't
know PCs were into SM  and I think I configured the jumpers
properly the MB one is the master the new MB one is the slave

The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong  I've
tried several combinations

controller  master  slave
controller  slave  master
master  controller  slave

None of them worked  Unfortunately I can't think of any others

Another possibility is that the MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C drive and D
drive setup info rather than drive  and drive  like most others
I've seen  Could this be confusing things

So I need HELP  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some
info for the CMOS setup the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card I cannibalized the cable it's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so
it looks like a serial connection now I be lost

Many many thanks in advance  This is practically an emergency I have
two papers to do on this thing for Monday  Help

In PC Magazine April   Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI
 faster than IDE and support up to  devices its acceptance has
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches

I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re
performance Where do they get those numbers I'll list the actual
performance ranges which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd
SCSII ranges from MBs
SCSIII ranges from MBs
IDE ranges from MBs
ESDI is always MBs although there are some nonstandard versions

By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct

How is  twice  Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes
the statment correct
Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE I include SCSI and ATA are
completely different ESDI is devicelevel like MFMRLL


With a SCSI controller chip SCSI can reach MBs which is indeed
 faster than IDE  of  is  ALL these SCSI facts have been

Great you can compare two numbers ATA has several speed modes by the
way but what the article said was misleadingwrong

posted to this newsgroup in my Mac  IBM info sheet available by FTP on
sumexaimstanfordedu  in the infomacreport as
macibmcompareversion txt It should be  but  may still be there

I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs
if they are really interested in this stuff


Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI chip
an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI chip Not at a MBs
MBs burst it does not SCSI is MBs maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER  It seems that Mac and IBM see

Something is missing there  Anyway I agree There's a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like SCSI compliant which tells
you nothing about the performance whether it has WIDE support etc

One reference for the Quadra's SCSI controller chip is
Digital Review Oct   v n p

What does it use Hopefully a good NCR chip eg c

Hi  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about
 minutes to warm up  

Previously when I first start up my PC I can see all the 
CMOS messages RAM test etc but now I've got to wait 
for about min before the display shows anything and
it starts up with a bright white flash  This only happens
when the system has been off for a long time eg overnight
If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
again the display works as normal like before

Does anyone know what is causing this  Is it a warning that
it will give up soon or just signs of aging the system is a
sx and its about  yrs old  I've used systems at work for
years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet

I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer

SCSI is better because it has a better future and it has a lot of
minor advantages right now  IDE cards are cheaper right now but will
be obsolete in a few years  In fact IDE cards are so cheap they
might as well be free  The real cost is in the IDE drives  SCSI
cards cost more but they are worth it


I almost got a hernia laughing at this one

You'll probably get one when you realize that your  vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks

If anything SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local
With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus

Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus  It actually  slows down your system
Bus IDE  It must be real nice to get shafted by  bucks for the
extra cost of a SCSI drive then pay another  for a SCSI controller

Maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus
IDE is

Vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi whatever intels spec is
VLBUS it not good for much more than vga cards

To each his own  I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you
spent for your  little ide drives and then finding out you need more
space

The biggest advantage of SCSI right now is that you can add more
different kinds of devices such as tapes etc easily and can add
bigger disks  The best and most cost effective hard disks available
are SCSI

Here Here



Only of you need drives larger then  meg  Oh yes gotta have  megssec
transfer rate for those speedy tape backups and cd rom drives

don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know
nothing about


I'd rather wait a second compared to the  minutes and ide would take
obviously exaggerated

Have you ever tried to backup  gigs of disk  Oh I forgot you can't
because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big


Basically if a person has to ask which one is better for himher
then they will probably never see the EXPENSIVE benefits from SCSI

I guess you probably bought a sx too


Also all this armwaving about SCSI expandability is a moot point if
the user only has one or two drives on it  And with SCSI those two
drives may be fast but that speed is only due to the onboard memory
cache  something I can duplicate with a caching IDE controller

What  The SCSI FASTWIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap

Stop this thread now Its just cluttering up bandwidth  If you want
to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive

the best SCSI FASTWIDEetc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive
All the response given are based upon personal experience with  or 
drives  You can't judge such completely different interfaces  
IDE has the low cost adavantage  a descent performance
SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed

neither one is better in all cases

If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of PCweek in whihc they tested vlbus eisa and isa
busmastering cards

I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an
ISA bus can only access MB of memory  Also that some video cards on
the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to  So that
if I wanted to put MB of memory on my PC my video card wouldn't have
anywhere to map it's memory to

Can someone explain this in more detail  Is there a way around this
limit

If you email me a response I will summarize

When I changed my motherboard I had a lot of trouble getting
LEDSPKRTURBOTURBOSWITCHHDDKLCKRST connectors correctly
reconnected For example Turbo Switch had three wires and
the motherboard connection only two pins and so on

Does anyone know a solution to this Do I need to rewire the
connectors or what is the best way to approach this
It is somewhat frustrating I got it to work somehow but my Turbo
switch doesn't work at all


I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions
My  cents worth

The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker 
A speaker being a coil it's bidirectional and makes no difference
which way you attach

Turbo switch   There are three wires to control how you want turbo
to become active with the switch pushed in or the switch out    I think
the middle wire is common   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire
connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in and which two
wires are connected when the switch is out   Place the appropriate
two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard

LED's   Turbo and HD  LED's are uni directional  Depending which
way the wires are attached the LED will not light  On my AMI motherboard
if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the
board the board will power up in default in Turbo mode   If your motherboard
is like that just attace the LED wires to the board  If the LED doesn't
light power off reverse the connectors and try again   It should work

If it does then attach the turbo switch to the board

Hope this helps

I would also like an explanation of this If anyone can explain
why the SB Pro and LPT  can share an IRQ please do so

I think it's simply because DOS doesn't use the IRQ for anything OS does
so with that you can't share the IRQ

That is correct  in DOS you can use IRQ  for your SBYou can't do
that under OS because it uses IRQ  for the printer

if it is using the GD I like the price of the Genoa  but if it
lags in performance behind the S cards I'll pay the extra  for one

 Where does all this disk space go The DOS partition table is fixed length
 and every hard disk carries one What is useing this lost MB

  If I remember right the partition table is allocated an entire CYLINDER
To find out how much it takes up you need to calculate
heads  sectors  

  Also if you create an extended partition there is a second 'partition'
in there for the logical drives

I think the original respondent Guy Dawson was refering to something
much more elementary

Every partition whether it is the entire disk or not has two FATs and
an initial directory

If you have a small disk  meg or less I would recommend that it remain
a single partition Unless you have some other consideration

If you have a large disk greater than  meg multiple partitions can
make sense

My Western Digital also has three sets of pins on the back I am using it with
another hard drive as well and the settings for the jumpers were written right 
on the circuit board of the WD driveMA SL 

Well I figured out how the jumpers go  Now I have quite a different
problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn't know  I have both drives
working the C system formatted and all of my hardware installed  Only
problem is that during the boot up sequence the computer does not want
to pass up looking for a system on the A drive

Reinitialization all goes fine and the BIOS seems to be configured to
what is necessary  All the drive tests work but when the thing comes
back around to the a drive and there is no disk present it just spins
If you insert a disk into drive a with a system however it works fine
and boots up ie how installed all my software

Any additional help on this will be most welcome

A hard drive with XTtype controller can be added but I recommend not trying

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a  watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed but it manages
when booting is finished plug in your floppy drive now it will work

ok I know this is not very user friendly maybe you are better off
buying a  with  watt power supply or something like that

The newer the drive the less problem you will have The old ten and fifteen
meg full heights were power hogs but I have over twenty units that I set up
running flawlessly with half height drives andor hard cards

  any where i can find out the technical specs for these UARTs would be

I suggest that you go direct to the original and preferredbest quality
source for all of this just as you would at least should for the chips
themselves  National Semiconductor  you can reach them at 
they no longer package the data sheets in a book as they did when I got
mine but you can get them as individual sets of data sheets  you want as
a minimum the following

     sets of data sheets
       NSINSANSCINSCA
       NSAF

     application notes yes GET THESE
       AN The NSA UART Design and Application Considerations
       AN A Comparison of the INS NS and NSAF Series
         of UARTs

both of the application notes I listed have proven to be AT LEAST as
valuable as the data sheets themselves more actually  AN in
particular is an exceptionally wellwritten application note that goes
into detail about how and why the  does what it does and how best
to take advantage of it

btw they send these out free as long as you don't abuse it

 faster  Does it have a better cache system  I thought SCSI was good at
 managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached  If we are
 only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently
 faster at managing data from a hard drive

 IDE  Integrated Device Electronics 
  currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized 
  drives Can have more than one hard drive Asynchronous Transfer MBs max

 Why don't you start with the specsheet of the ISA bus first
 You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face but if they
 exceed the ISA bus capability then what's the point

Who said ISA was necessary  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth
investing thousands of dollars eg a new pc's worth of money  in 

 Who says IDE is limited to  megssec  What about VLBIDE  Does anyone
 know how they perform

You didn't read to carefully  VLBIDE uses the same connection mechanism
as standard IDE  If transfer rate is limited by IDE whether it's
interfaced to ISA EISA or VLB matters not

 So at its LOWEST setting SCSI interface in Asynchronous SCSI mode AVERAGES 
 the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode  In full SCSI mode
 it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can
 As implimented on what system  

On mine for one thing  SCSI blows IDE out of the water hands down  If
IDE has better throughput why isn't it used on workstations and file
servers  

 The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
 rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI comes from  NOT
 the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
 SCSI through put  

 Given the original question SCSI used only as a single hard drive
 controller  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
 at least  maybe  megssec for the SCSI choice to make any sence
 What does a  meg  megssec SCSI drive cost

No that's the nice thing  on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives
at once  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs along with windogs and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time  It's pretty ugly

I just bought at Quantum  for my mac at home  I paid  for it  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper

 The original CGA cart back in ' was   I think the original EGA card
 or PGA was   SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
 in price mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
 or SGI or name your favorite unix workstation  That is after millions
 of PC buying decisions over the years SCSI has had plenty of time to
 come down in price

No actually we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC  If they had a common read
easily implemented method of adding scsi to a PC like as in a Sun or
Mac then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice

 I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented
 data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
 than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OS's when
 managing data from a single SCSI hard drive

On a single drive SCSI is more expensive  But you bought your PC for
expandibility so you'd want to add more drives or whatever  The
following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE

A partial list
	  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently
	  A SCSI device works on many different machines I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI  hook them up and away they go
	  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices  For
	instance recently I added an older connor  meg IDE to a maxtor
	 meg IDE  The connor MUST be setup as the slave  It will
	work no other way  On SCSI you set the address check the
	termination plug it in and away it goes
	  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion  I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c
	to d on a SCSI system  Under a multitasking OS this is very
	noticable as many things can be going on at once

One neat thing that I've noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the
ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem  we've got a bunch of almost dead  meg drives that I've
added to my PC  I've now got the interface full but it does allow me to
have   meg drives   meg drive  tape drive and   meg drive
all on the same card  

Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE  No mysterious jumpers to figure out

Then don't complain maybe it wasn't you that SCSI was so expensive on
PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus
ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow
Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when

You didn't read to carefully  VLBIDE uses the same connection mechanism

I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed

On mine for one thing  SCSI blows IDE out of the water hands down  If
IDE has better throughput why isn't it used on workstations and file
servers  

IDE is just a variant of the old IBM MFM AT controller  at least that's
how it looks from a software point of view  It was never meant to be
an allencompassing protocalstandard to be implimented across different
platforms

Is there any argument that 
IDE can or can't transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the
drive is able to provide the data  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able
to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface because
of a higher RPM platter different arrangement of heads etc

 Given the original question SCSI used only as a single hard drive
 controller  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
 at least  maybe  megssec for the SCSI choice to make any sence
 What does a  meg  megssec SCSI drive cost

No that's the nice thing  on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives
at once  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs along with windogs and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time  It's pretty ugly

If data is going from one drive to another and if SCSI has the ability to
perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main
memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it  As far as I know IDE
can't do that  But when the CPU wants data from both drives data to be stored
in main memory are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives 
at the same time and storetransfer that data to main memory also at the
same time  Working off  IRQ and  DMA channel on an ISA or whatever bus

I just bought at Quantum  for my mac at home  I paid  for it  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor  meg IDE drive for   that's 
million bytes or  megabytes  With the basic  interface he gets
close to  megsec transfer on his   Does your figure include a few
hundred  for SCSI drivers

No actually we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC  If they had a common read
easily implemented method of adding scsi to a PC like as in a Sun or
Mac then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice

So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type
considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cdrom drives or
tape backups or etc  That most PC's only have or had  hard drive and
run DOS  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives
at the time  and how common were SCSI drives under  megs  to  years
ago  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice

 I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented
 data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
 than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OS's when
 managing data from a single SCSI hard drive

On a single drive SCSI is more expensive

But on that point is it faster  This is what all this is about  Do you
get more performance for the money  For all the people that will only have
a single hard drive in their system regardless of the OS will the SCSI
choice really give them more performance than IDE

But you bought your PC for
expandibility so you'd want to add more drives or whatever

True but expandibility can also start on the bus which means the option
is there for cdrom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards

	  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently

No argument  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the
best reason  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer
eventually acquire  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single
hard drive system

	  A SCSI device works on many different machines I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI  hook them up and away they go

With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs are you really sure that
PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible  And even if they are 
is the data accessible from either machine ie are there no formatting
partitioning or file table differences  Is it really plug'n'play

	  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices  For
	instance recently I added an older connor  meg IDE to a maxtor
	 meg IDE  The connor MUST be setup as the slave  It will
	work no other way  On SCSI you set the address check the
	termination plug it in and away it goes

So the C drive on the connor becomes a logical D drive to DOS  Is this
really a problem  

	  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion  I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c
	to d on a SCSI system  Under a multitasking OS this is very
	noticable as many things can be going on at once

After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers
I have never seen any differences when switching between drives nor
have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
tofrom the same drive

One neat thing that I've noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the
ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem  we've got a bunch of almost dead  meg drives that I've
added to my PC  I've now got the interface full but it does allow me to
have   meg drives   meg drive  tape drive and   meg drive
all on the same card  

That is nice as long as the power supply can keep up  I do believe that
there is the possibility for up to  IDE drives on a PC

Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE  No mysterious jumpers to figure out

But what about mysterious and expensive drivers to figure out  At least
IDE doesn't require drivers that consume precious conventional DOS memory

Hello all

You the Net are my last resort or I'll just change my job 
This might be a FAQ eg mixing controllers but haven't seen any

Sys  AMI BIOS and your runofthe mill multiIO card with
serialsparalfloppies and 
	 IDE controller clone GwEX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller  
	 Quantum ProDrive LPS  M type  cyl hds spt

Pb I want to bring in this nd hand neat price
	 Maxtor XTBE M ms BIOS type  ctrller manages
		the real geom cyl hds spt
	 Western Digital WDVSE ESDI ctrller no floppies
		jumpers set IRQ  hw port addr F
		and BIOS addr CCC and other floppyformat stuff

Goal have the WD ESDI as a secondarycontroller and have both disks 
simultaneously working Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected

Ultimate goal have room for Linux et al
Ex of scheme I have in mind boot from IDE HD or floppy and mount
the ESDI as root Not booting from ESDI or even from HD is acceptable

I have tried numerous all combinations to no avail They work alone
or can coexist witout hangups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE 
depending on setupjumpers

Useful suggestions might be
 How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers I guess the nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the st
 Do I need some driver to make it work
    some new BIOSchip for any of these cards
 do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy IDE
is cheaper ESDI is hard to find and rather costly I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around so soft slns are preferred
 adapters of some sort I can hold a soldering iron and can change
a chip or put a jumper

Also useful

 ftp archives with relevant info
 expert stores in Toronto Ontario area that would be a miracle haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while

devices on the bus  This greatly increases productivity or at least do

Once in a while you have to put in a good word for something that works
well  I have had no problems with my Toshiba   It works very well with
DOS and OS  For OS you don't need to load any special drivers  The
installation will detect that it is a Toshiba drive and you are done

BTW it's also very fast

We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM  floppy drive as the second

spinning and stepping but gives a Disk not ready error

There are two jumpers which seem to work best open a  position DIP
switch and a  position DIP switch  We don't know how to set the DIP
switches and think that may be the problem

Any information or advice other than junk the stupid thing  would be

A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data

IDE also uses DMA techniques  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA
and most AD boards also use DMA  DMA is no big deal and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI

 For example when rewinding or formatting a tape the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus  This greatly increases productivity or at least do
something else while backing up your hard drive   Which happens to be
what I am doing while reading this group

You can thank your software for that  If DOS had a few more brains it
could format floppies etc while you were doing something else  The
hardware will support it but DOS at least won't  Again this has   
nothing to do with SCSI

Its a long story but I still use IDE on my  except for the CDROM which
thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines  If and when SCSI is
better standardized and supported on the ibmclone machines I plan to
completely get rid of IDE

And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask

Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS type OS do all the miraculous things
with an IDE harddrive that it can with a single SCSI hard drive

Have anyone heard about it or using it What is it's performance Is it
stable or not Please give me some advice
 
        In addition I heard a news from local distributor that a new
baud CCITT ROM the distributor said it will be the new CCITT 
standard for this modem will be produced at the end of this 
year After replaced the old ROM by this  ROM this Spirit II can
transfer data at baud without any hardware alternation Is this 
new true and possible Would the telephone line really able to transfer 
at such high speed Please give me some advice
 
        At last can anyone tell me how to contact with the central 
dealer QuickComm Inc I am not sure whether it in USA or not

        I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead  and
could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is
familiar with them
 
        The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget  VLB
tower  For about  delivered it offers VLB MB MB IDE a Mitsumi
CDROM with software bundle Media Vision Sound board  CTX NI
K Cache and the usual drives ports  OS software  Since my budget is
 for a system it seems almost too good to be true which may mean it
IS too good to be true of course Among other things I've never seen a
review of the Budget systems or their parent company Micro Smart or of
the motherboard they are using the Aetana Any feedback would be
appreciated
 
        In a similar vein the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's
Elite VESA  tower with a Diamond Viper MB  Midwest Micro  MI
monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere  I'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line  and some idea of their quality would be abig
benefit here as well
 
        Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated  my
greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities
 
	Email response would be greatly appreciated

	Thanks

I just bought at Quantum  for my mac at home  I paid  for it  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor  meg IDE drive for   that's 
million bytes or  megabytes  With the basic  interface he gets
close to  megsec transfer on his   Does your figure include a few
hundred  for SCSI drivers
Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI for hard drives YES the figure includes a
hundred  for SCSI drivers  This is sloppy people and DUMB

But on that point is it faster  This is what all this is about  Do you
get more performance for the money
Ok once again with the SCSI spec list
SCSI with a SCSI controler chip synchronous range is indeed MBs
 asynchronous range is slower at MBs
SCSI With a SCSI controller chip MBs with MBs burst bit
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI
 so it DOES exist Some PCs use this set up too

SCSI bitSCSI mode          MBs with MBs burst
for those who want SCSI but don't want to pay for the bit or bit
 hardware or mess with the SCSI software controllers  Usable by SCSI
 devices with close to bit SCSI speeds
SCSI bitwide or fast mode  MBs with MBs burst
SCSI bitwide AND fast     MBs with MBs burst

On the other interfaces let DXBpsuvmpsuedu speak
IDE ranges from MBs                          
Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
 Range MBs
ESDI is always MBs although there are some nonstandard versions

One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by
people  Its PROPER meaning is The set of SCSI interfaces composed of
SCSI AND SCSI
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote
My comments in 

PC Magazine April   Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI
This is asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip  faster than IDE
this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip AND bit SCSI
To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read
asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip
Although asynchronous SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI one third the 
speed of IDE
or asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip or bit SCSI
Although SCSI with a SCSI chip and bit SCSI are eight times as fast as
ESDI  faster than IDE

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself  This eliminates ambaguity

SCSI drivers are somewhat reasonable while bit and bit SCSI drivers 
are VERY expansive bit SCSI can use SCSI drivers with little speed
degridationthe Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI or SCSI or SCSI over all SCSI AND SCSI
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE

The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives
and monitor  The floppies are k and the monitor is CGA but you will need
an adaptor cable to use it  The junior does not use standard cards  Unless 
you're really strapped for cash you should just junk the thing and buy new

Why the spec list again  We are talking SCSI on a PC not on a MAC or

This isin't compperiphsSCSI
Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC

Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this

Can anyone tell me if this card works with the March OS  beta

 I believe so since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very 
reliable in OS 

The BusLogic cards have an OS  driver that does work with the March 
beta Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS  any longer
If you wish to install the beta from the CDROM you will need to REM out the
Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic
cards when OS attempts to use them Thanks Adaptec 

So you add the BusLogic drivers to the configsys on the CDROM boot disk and
REM out the Adaptec drivers

Then you install the whole st half of the Beta and it won't work IBM
nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again Thanks IBM So REM out
the Adaptec drivers once more and reboot If you have everything in the
right order it will work

Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation except OS
will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end so you
are off to more REM statements and more fun 

The BT Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that
do not come with drivers The DOS drivers work great This card can easily be
configured to work with  different sets of IO ports and you can use
multiple host adapters in one machine If you get a new card it will also be
able to support up to  GB drives under DOS

Hope this helps

i came upon this idea i would like to share with everyone

to check for bad memory chips

 create a boot disk with emm himemsys and ramdrivesys in the
   configautoexecbat

 boot the PC to create a RAM drive as large as possible

 use a disk repair utility  I use NDD  Run it on the RAM
        drive yes it will run its only a device driver

 run  or so passes they go very quick

 if your machine fails there is a definate bad memory chip

 if your machine passes there is a conflict with programs you
        are loading in memory


It's an interesting idea but the worstcase data patterns developed to
test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect
common faults in memory chips

What group is this  This is not a MAC group
Nice of you to DELETE BOTH YOUR responce and the item that prompted it
to whit
I just bought at Quantum  for my mac at home  I paid  for it  I
                                      
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper
To which YOU responded
A friend of mine just got a Maxtor  meg IDE drive for   that's 
million bytes or  megabytes  With the basic  interface he gets
close to  megsec transfer on his   Does your figure include a few
hundred  for SCSI drivers
To which I correctly pointed out the following                         
Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI for hard drives YES the figure includes a
hundred  for SCSI drivers  This is sloppy people and DUMB
As I said this is sloppy and DUMB YOU should resounded by DISCOUNTING the Mac
NOT giving Maxtor  meg IDE drive for  example  By giving an
example you give the IMPLIED consent that for MAC info to be INCLUDED
in the SCSI discusion

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list
Why the spec list again  We are talking SCSI on a PC not on a MAC or
a UNIX box  And we are talking ISA bus or possibly EISA or VLB
Ok I will do this V E R Y  S L O W L Y so you can understand
REGUARDLESS of whether it is a Mac or a PC SCSI and SCSI are DIFFERENT
from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous SCSI  All of these
have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is
dumb and sloppy  Take again the quote later on as an example of the problem 
in the PC world The spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were
coming from in the article  It shows the article is CORRECT in it
staments about SCSI but not CONSITANT

This isin't compperiphsSCSI
With the way this thread has gone how do you tell 
Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC
with an ISA or EISA or VLB bus
Already GAVE them  YOU keep deleting them So here are the Specs
on everybody AGAIN With some added info

SCSI SCSI controler chip asynchronous range MBs
 synchronous range MBs  Both common to the PC world difference is
 mainly in software not hardware

SCSI SCSI controller chip also called SCSI bit MBs with 
MBs burst  This is advertised as SCSI in BYTE  FOR the
 PC and AT THESE SPEEDSNOT the Mac the PC

I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC
SCSI bitwide or fast mode  MBs with MBs burst
SCSI bitwide AND fast     MBs with MBs burst

On the other interfaces let DXBpsuvmpsuedu speak
IDE ranges from MBs                          
 asynchronous range MBs infered from BYTE 
 synchronous range MBs
ESDI is always MBs although there are some nonstandard versions

wlsmithvalveheartrriuwoca Wayne Smith writes
Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this
debate  I'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can
handle the  megssec of SCSI xyz wide'n'fast but the PC isin't one of
them
Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI which holds true
a Mac OR IBMPC clone with the correct hardware and software
And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY 
CANNOT WE

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI or SCSI or SCSI over all SCSI AND SCSI
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE

Well maybe if the SCSI design people had their act together than maybe
all PC's would have built in SCSI ports by now
With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with
SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT Like YOU
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote 
My comments in 
Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDIThis is asynchronous SCSI with
a SCSI chip  faster than IDE this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI with 
a SCSI chip AND bit SCSI PC Magazine April  
The ARTICLE is confused NOT SCSI  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use
NOT because the interface itself is a mess

SCSI means The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI AND SCSI
NOT 'SCSI' as some people want to use it

To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read
asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip
Although asynchronous SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI one third the 
speed of IDE
or asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip or bit SCSI
Although SCSI with a SCSI chip and bit SCSI are eight times as fast as
ESDI  faster than IDE

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself  This eliminates ambaguity

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI or SCSI or SCSI over all SCSI AND SCSI  Lumping
everything into SCSI as SCSI is SLOPPY WRONG and DUMB  Inconsitant
SCSI and SCSI usage is also a problem  Clean it up now or have
a mess like SVGA was several years ago because everybody and his Uncle
slapped 'SCSA' an their own monitor inteface SCSI IS standarized unlike
SVGA was years ago EXCEPT in terminaology

 I'm kind of new at the pc stuff  My machine has  serial ports  Com  and

No but some OS's  COHERENT  etc  are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the IRQ In your example after accessing the
modem the mouse won't work until you reboot because the IRQ is used by
the modem

 If Answer is NO should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different  And
 does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too

Yes you can change the IRQ's for com but it depends on your other
hardware com uses IRQ com IRQ  If you have only one printerport 
 IRQ  you can change com to IRQ  normally nd printer  For com
you can assign IRQ if its free As far as I know no other IRQ can be
used until your IOcard is bit and caould access IRQ's

Today I recieved a inwarranty replacement for my
Diamond Speedstar X  On the card I've noticed a few
changes mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP
The card is revision A

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connectsdisconnects the BALE line on the pin part
of the ISA bus

The question I have is simple
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar X
what does the manual claim that this jumper does

To anyone with an ISAreference what is the function of the
BALE line

On a related note
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus  My motherboard manual has a simple pintosignalname
chart but that is it

I'm using inth to read my joystick and it is hideously slow  Something
like  of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick and this
is in a program that does nothing but printf and JoyRead

If you only do readprint then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take  of the time even if it is efficient

The problem is that a lot of programs trap inth  like SMARTDRV  and
so it is a slow as hell interface  Can I read the joystick port in
a reasonably safe fashion via polling  And that isn't platform or
clockspeed specific

The truth is that int H joystick reading IS slow I read it directly
from the hardware port Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts so you may want to read say twice in a
row and keep the lower results Don't just turn interrupts off it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices

Here is an example of how to do this

  joyc  

 An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port
  directly
  Uses inpoutp for byte port access
  Will timeout when 'int count' counts up to zero
  This sample reads one port A is presented and B is in the comments
  You can read both at once by merging the two but it will time out
  when either joystick is not connected
 
  There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as
  the joystick circuitry needs

Okay here is my configuration

 Gateway C Micronics ISA
MB RAM 
WDMB IDE HD  drive C 
STA MB IDE HD  drive D 
Adaptec SCSI B controller with SCSI BIOS enabled
Seagate STN MB SCSI drive

Alrighty when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message but it says
something like

Drive C installed
Drive D installed
ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed

And I can't get to the Seagate drive

I go into PhoenixBIOS setup remove the entry for drive D and BOOM I can
access the Seagate  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate
at the same time  I have ASPIDOSSYS but it just hangs the system

We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway  I finally
got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives  The only
reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several
bootable 's and some  based install disks which expected
the A drive  I order all new software and upgrades to be  and
the number of stupid install programs that can't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time  the ones I had are now upgraded  And
as for the bootable 's I just cut  replacements

If switching the drives is not an option you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis  I haven't tried it but I think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully

I did this  I use a relay Radio Shack PDT instead of a huge
switch  This way if the relay breaks my drives will still work

It works fine but you may still need to change the CMOS before the
drive switch will work correctly for some programs

I recently bought a Leading Edge DX mini tower case and everything
works fine Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and whatnot I would
tend to say that it is a decent deal The only things you might want to be
wary about is that my LE computer has a backplane mounted motherboard
Ie The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane
Some people don't like these configurations The second thing is that
whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were
doing The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the
SVGA cardMonitor Look forward to configuring the system optimally
yourself

 I have the same question as Guido It is possible to use the ESDI drive 
 as a master and the IDE drive as the slave  

I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave as
I have just upgraded my machine with a Mb IDE  And custom Controller
Mdl CI Extended IDE Controller  While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as
master Drive  The trick is the controller which supports up to  IDE Drives
while coexisting with existing Controllers  MFMRLLESDISCSI 

So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI and I can assure
you it works with RLL

 Okay here is my configuration

 MB RAM 
 WDMB IDE HD  drive C 
 STA MB IDE HD  drive D 
 Adaptec SCSI B controller with SCSI BIOS enabled
 Seagate STN MB SCSI drive
 
 Alrighty when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message but it says
 something like
 
 Drive C installed
 Drive D installed
 ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed
 
 And I can't get to the Seagate drive
 
 I go into PhoenixBIOS setup remove the entry for drive D and BOOM I can
 access the Seagate  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate
 at the same time  I have ASPIDOSSYS but it just hangs the system
 
 Brian
 

There is a simple answer  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive  Any builtin drives eg IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive  But if there are already two drives then no can do

The solution is simple use the aspidos device driver and disable the
scsi bios as it is useless in your case  It works like a champ  I
have seen a similar situation before

Good Luck

  A quick look through the Computer Shopper gave the following companies
that sell  monochrome monitors for less than  PC or PS compatible
  Cornerstone Technology Digital Technology Hardware That Fits
  IBM Ikegami Image Systems Nanao Radius
  RanGer Technologies Sampo Samsung Sigma Designs

Most of these are singlescan monitors which are useless for most
PC users  I posted requests for information in other newsgroups which
were mostly fruitless but I have managed to track down two multisync
grayscal monitors in the  range one  and one   I am still
looking into it and I will post the results when I get more info

Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bidirectional
printer port

I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit  of port
xf and controlling bit  of port xa for the direction of data flow ie
 for output  for input

The same code does not work on my desktop machine I have heard that i might
have to use bit  of port xa however this also does not work

For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER IO cards and have been
running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
pretty sure that the printer port is bidirectional


Any information would be greatly appreasiated

Please post a reply here or Email me on

Summary  box with NEXTSTEP


First of all  Thank you everyone who replied  As you can well
imagine I got nearly one hundred responses so I figured I'd thank
you all here instead of individually

The tallies

I got one vote for AUX which runs on the Macintosh

I got several nays for Commodore's UX system

Most people agreed that SGI's were nice and very very expensive

Some devoted Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a used
Sun say a  or 

About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXTonly now NeXT
is out of the hardware business see below

And most of the other  people said  Get a  box and run some
version of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain or
commercially



And so I weighed my options  What stood out in my opinion was that
there were several different versions of Unix available on one system
the  PC architecture  If I bought a Sun I'd have to use SunOS
If I bought a used NeXT I'd have to use NeXTSTEP see below  Ad
nauseum

But with a PC I can run Linux which is a small userfriendly 
flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume although I
hear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with bsd another
PD free port which takes up a lot more space  I can purchase
BSD commercial product if I choose  There are several other
commercial packages available

So what I've found out after pricing systems etc is that I can
get a really good Unix workstation for as little as   Including
source code

Or for  I can get an unbelievable EISA bus DX
system fully blown and run single user BSD

What I'm really excited about though is NEXTSTEP for Intel  NeXT
changed into a software company only and they are releasing their OS
for PC's  I've used NeXT's before and I absolutely loved them
Everyone who wrote me about NeXT or NEXTSTEP commented on the
developer's environment and how well designed the whole package is



So my choice is to

  Wait for the mail on Monday so I can read what NEXTSTEP's system
requirements are

  If I'm wowed on what they say I'll buy a system that fits into
their criteria

    a  Get NEXTSTEP

  If I'm wowed but I can't afford it yet most likely I'll buy a
system that fits their criteria

    a  Get Linux or bsd as a temporary learning experience so I
can save up for NEXTSTEP

  If I'm not sufficiently wowed least likely I'll buy a system
that is slightly less blown out like a DX  ISA and put Linux
or bsd on it



Again thanks to everyone around the net

Hello

I already tried our national news group without success

I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PSPC
with a normal TEAC drive
I already identified the power supply on pins  V and  V shorted
pin   switch and inserted pullup resistors K on pins
    and 
The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD but the FD's light
stays on all the time The drive spins up ok when I insert a disk
but I can't access it
The TEAC works fine in a normal PC

Are there any points I missed

Thank you

If the disk is not an HDtype disk ie with the extra hole in the case
opposite the normal write protect hole the drive will not write to the
disk You can punch a similar hole with whatever is handy or buy a small

   Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ The hardware will
automagically wrap IRQ to IRQ on AT class machines eg anything with high
IRQs This is what I'm doing on my set up right now 
   I've got COM on IRQ really IRQ  address it this way in software COM
on IRQ SoundBlaster on IRQ LPT on IRQ and my ATI BusMouse port on one of
the interrupts in between Works just great
   If you need even more there's a text file floating around somewhere that
details how to hack up any serial card and probably any others to work on the
higher IRQs It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the bit expansion bus

  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ This will be the 

first IRQ serviced by the system giving the modem a better response  
especially handy under multitaskers like OS  which I'm running with no
problems

'lo all

  I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration
It's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
network  Actually it already is running it's just not getting all
the info I want it to yet  Anyway I want to check for a mouse  I
already check for a mouse driver using the code in Microsoft's Mouse
book  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs or that they ever load the driver

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine how
do I detect is a mouse is attached  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it

  Thanks in advance

There is a way in which a multitasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before and that is with IO overlap
With IO overlap your CPU can continue to think while disk
operations are underway whereas without overlap your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish  and disk operations take
an eternity compared to a fast CPU

So when you've got multitasking you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do

One way is with DMA or bus mastering  Either of these make it
possible for IO devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering  IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes with no DMA

   point of view why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi
   tasking  Data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive  Can
   SCSI find it faster  can it get it off the drive and into the computer
   faster  Does it have a better cache system  I thought SCSI was good at
   managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached  If we are
   only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently
   faster at managing data from a hard drive

The Adaptec series use bus mastering  This means that the CPU
doesn't sit waiting for data bytes it can go off and do other
computing  if you have an advanced multitasking OS that is  DOS
just sits and waits anyway


   IDE  Integrated Device Electronics 
    currently the most common standard and is mainly used for
    medium sized drives Can have more than one hard drive
    Asynchronous Transfer MBs max

   Why don't you start with the specsheet of the ISA bus first
   You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face but if they
   exceed the ISA bus capability then what's the point

   Who says IDE is limited to  megssec  What about VLBIDE  Does anyone
   know how they perform

Why don't you start with the specsheet of the ISA bus first  IDE
was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided  in essence IDE is
ISA on a ribbon cable  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA 
MHz clock  bit width MBsec

This is why I've concluded that IDE on VLbus is a waste of a fast
slot  The card's job would to slow the VLbus transactions to ISA
speed  Heck that's what ISA slots do  I'll just use one of those
instead

    but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
    than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OS's when
    managing data from a single SCSI hard drive
   
   A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data
   from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
   and moves it to memory 

   IDE also uses DMA techniques  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA
   and most AD boards also use DMA  DMA is no big deal and has nothing to
   do directly with SCSI

IDE does not do DMA  This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk
interface  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
controller card then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main
memory where it's needed  If IDE doesn't work this way then it's not
compatible

Heck if IDE used DMA then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than M RAM not working with their IDE
drives  M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble

BTW there are DMAenabling signals in the IDE cable spec but the
last report I heard was that they are never implemented because it
would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers

I just picked up a secondhand color option for the NEC P
pin dot matrix printer  Alas there were no installation instructions
so I am totally confused on WHY it WON'T GO IN

Do I have to remove the actaual print head  It seems almost to fit
but not quite

Please any info would be most appreciated

I have AMI bios I have poked around the bios but haven't tried this but somewhere it says BOOT AC
I would assume that you could probably slip in a b
althoug a I haven't tried it and
b don't mess with your CMOS unless you know what your doing

I hate to burst your bubble but you cannot slip in a B to that
particular AMI BIOS setting That setting only allows you to set
the boot order of the floppy A with respect to the primary HD C
ie check A first then C or check C then A

I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for
mine to arrive in the mail There seems to be a lot of
complaints about minor alignment problems with the MXF One
article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
and was told that his screen rotation was within spec 

That figure  for image rotation would seem to be a little high
on my NEC FG the specs call for no greater than mm 

Well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has
a very noticable barrel distortion It's not dramatic but it
is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't
fill the entire screen The fact that it is worse on the right
side doesn't help matters

What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect I don't want
to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
problem Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment 

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned they are
adjusted to factoryspec before leaving the central USA distribution point
MA for the eastern Canadian market Now here's the key NEC knows that
the  monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances with all the bumps rough handling and such and therefore
expect and at least in theory require that the local distributor
not dealer have it adjusted at the local service centre Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto before sale This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor
the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is in my
case quite 

Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections

I for one was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor not perfect IMHO
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was normal The short answer is no don't accept these
imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors one has a right to expect higher quality and
if you're persistent you'll receive it

Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated
MHz clock  bit width MBsec
If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the MBs sighted for IDE come from

SCSI is not complex It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it
There are THREE key differences in SCSI the controller chip the port and
the software  THAT IS IT
Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point

SCSI asynchronous and synchronous modes SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY
 asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode only MBs vs MBs
 synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi divices with a
 rewrite of the software driver As is the case for the Mac Quadra

SCSI bit THIS is the main source for the confusion This differs from
 SCSI ONLY in the controler chip in most machines  In the Mac and some PCs
 this is called 'fast SCSI' because it uses SCSI ports and software drivers
 AND can produce SCSI SPEEDS through SCSI INSPITE of this even in the 
 slower asynchronous mode  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi mode 
 MBs with MBsSee in both Quadras and higher end PCs Synchronous
 mode just allows a higher burst rate MBs

SCSI bit TWO versionsWideFast  Wide SCSI requires TWO things
 over bit SCSI  a SCSI software driver and a wide SCSI port on the
 machine and the external device
 Fast SCSI also requires TWO things over bit SCSI SCSI driver
 software and that the RECIEVING devise support bit fast SCSI
 Speed of both is the same MBs with MBs burst

SCSI bit  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI  Over bit SCSI this
 requires SCSI driver software wide SCSI port and that the RECIEVING
 devices ALSO have a bit mode SCSI chip  As expected this is VERY
 expencive  Speed MBs with MBs bursts
 

As I said SIMPLE  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software the 
controler chip and the port Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to
only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE the chip and the port

Hi

I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general Some software
others hardware orientated Probably the wrong newsgroup  as everyone 
claims

Anyway

 Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 
SVGA graphics card MB or even what the dip switches do on the end Mine
already works fine albeit slow and after having blown up a monitor I found 
out which switch controlled the interlacenon interlace facility 

But I'm curious as to why there are  dip switches on the card with apparantly
little use

 Secondly does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design
of the PC motherboard with respect to the RAM IE    or  K 

 Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc  or  bit
  or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed
Yeah I know its a piece of cake I'm lazy 

 Software wise Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM
on a PC from a program written in Turbo C 

For instance using farcoreleft and coreleft return only memory available
from the base K regardless of combinations of EMM etc etc
What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the MB boundary

I'm not certain whether farmalloc  new actually uses it anyway but I'll 
suspect not  

 Also what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be reentrant
   As a follow on does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls
    to C from within a DOS interrupt Ie will changing the stack size on
   entry be of use Two articles I've read on the subject have given 
   conflicting views Does anyone have any views on writing direct to
   screen memory in terms of portability

Many thanks
Gotta go bars closing soon 
Cheers
Ian

Fellow netters

I'm in the market for a hand scanner  However I don't know anyone who has
one  I have my eye on two choices

Dexxa  This scanner is available at WalMart for   It includes GrayWorks
software and provides  dpi and  grayscales I think  The OCR software
Catchword is available through mailorder for about  also

Mustek  Gray Artist for Windows  This scanner offers  grayscales
according to Cad  Graphics and  dpi  It is available for 
mailorder and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE

I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner B from Cad  Graphics  It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution 
dpi and price   

Basically I would like recommendations on which to buy  I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners  But which one is the
best buy  Would  dpi really be helpful output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ  x to x  I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices  Which should I buy

If you have a hand scanner please let me know whether or not you would
recommend it  Also if you know of another scanner within the price range
under  that would be a better deal please EMail me  Any and all help
would be greatly appreciated

and they too said that the Nanao Ti was the best monitor to get if
you had the money But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality
This monitor can be had for around 

Has anyone actually seen any of these 

I am responsible for choosing standard components in my company and as part
of my review i got the Viewsonic  Mitsubishi  and Nanao Fis  I picked
the Fi even though it costs more than the other two choices because it
has a the best clarity and text is not fuzzy at all  The Viewsonic  is the
worst the Mitsubishi  is much better but the Nanao Fi blows both of
them out of the water  I don't understand why the Nanao is so much better 
since one would think that the Mitsubishi  with it's Trinitron tube would
be better  I can only imagine that the Nanao Ti must be incredible if it
is beter than the Fi
 

Michael G Reamy mreamyrockconcertnet

The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon

One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was
the Mitsubishi  I also reviewed a new Nanao the FiW which has just
been released  Last year for the May ' issue of Windows I reviewed
several monitors including the Nanao Ti  There's no question that the
Nanao monitors are the best available this year just as they were last
year  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the
ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
criteria and the scoring  I used different tests than they did and I
scored differently  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi and it
scored very highly in my tests but it was a few points shy of perfect

Incidentally one of the things everyone should do when they're reading
reviews of any product whether it's monitors or mice is to read the
criteria and methodology carefully  Unless you know how the product
testing was done and on what the scores are based you can't possibly
know what they really mean  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently
from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking  Likewise it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
your needs unless you know how we did the testing  After all some of
what we do may not apply to you  Likewise some of what we do may apply
more closely in one review than in another  You can't always tell
anything from reading the  or so words of commentary we write if you
don't also understand the scoring

You need a monitor cable that has a VGA connector on one end and five BNC
connectors on the other  I bought one from Nanao when I bought the Nanao
monitor I use which also has five BNC connectors  Check with a computer
store that sells good monitors  Quite a few companies use that setup

Hello folks

I have an Archive XL internal QIC tape drive which is pretty
comparable to the Colorado Jumbo   Since I have two floppy drives in
my system I'm using a small card not accelerated made by Archive to 
attach my tape drive as a third floppy device

The problem Although the DOSbased QICstream software works just fine
both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless
I switch the machine to nonturbo speed I'm using a DX EISA  Since
the DOS software works it can't be a hardware problem can it  Has anyone
seen similar problems  Any solutions  Thanks in advance

Yeah  Sounds typical  Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware
and therefore your machine can't keep up with things  Ever notice how when
acessing the floppies in Windows everything else slows to a crawl  I 
imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time
and sometimes the backup program loses  Be glad  I can't even run in 
medium speed with CP backup on my machine supposedly because I have a SCSI
machine which places extra demands on the data bus

Another albeit strange option is using a program like  II
available via anonymous FTP at many major sites or FDFORMAT
also available via anonymous FTP that allows you to format
HD disks to Meg or HD disks to Meg along with
many MANY other formats so you can DISKCOPY yes the broken
MeSsyDOS DISKCOPY the  disks onto  disks or vice

game disks on my old Tandy  and it works  Another program
named Teledisk sharewareavailable on many major BBS's will
also make the weird format disks provided you have  II

properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format
At least this is a software solution for a hardwareBIOS

are the chances that if I buy one of these modems using the

 PC Magazine just did another review of highend graphics accelerators  For all
 around performance Windows DOS CAD go for ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  They've
 done two reviews in the last three months and that card ranks as an editors
 choice in both reviews  For all around performance it seems it just can't be
 beat  You should pick up this issue of PCMag April  and check it out for
 yourself  


Windows The recent reviews have all shown that the P cards are
	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card

VGA	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P cards they looked
	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card  About
	  the speed as I recall

	 The big question for me is the Orchid V card  Each of the 
	 P cards tested so far has had the W to do VGA  Orchid
	 is the only one I know about I don't know about AMI that uses
	 the W for VGA  That is reportedly faster
	 
	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as
	 the ATI card  If so it would appear to be a formidable competitor
	 Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards

Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
Orchid V card  has that card arrived  What do the benchmarks look
like

Also is the AMI Pbased card real  What does it use for VGA  Speed

But I still cannot connect to my favorite DOS bbs with any kind

would hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least

What I usually get is a fast stream of garbage in the modem response

first then I get about  screens of garbage  In both cases the
modem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier

I am using DEFAULT settings ATF and getting this problem  I
am using the AUTOCONFIGURE settings that Gateway has supplied with
my copy of Qmodem ATWCDSW and getting this problem
They have refused to help me beyond this claiming it must be

Also is the AMI Pbased card real  What does it use for VGA  Speed

  I think it's available in limited quantites  No idea of what VGA

  Be very careful with OEM P boards though the Orchid I got

What's the word on the chipset  Is this a ROM bug specific 
to a specific brand using the Rockwell or is it the Rockwell
chipset itself

There were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much
expected with any FAXmodem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new  I'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems so you'll have to get it
from someone else

However I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU as opposed to the DPU for an internal implementation
This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a
 interface  Without the  interface the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions like in windows  As far as I know the speed buffering
works OK for external modems if a  is used on the internal serial
port board

Hope this helps

     Can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if I get OS I might 
   need an SCSI controler rather than an IDE  Will performance suffer that
   much  For a MB or so drive  If I don't have a tape drive or CDROM
   Any help would be appreciated

So when you've got multitasking you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do

One way is with DMA or bus mastering  Either of these make it
possible for IO devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering
 
How do you do busmastering on the ISA bus

IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes with no DMA

If we're talking ISA AT bus here then you can only have  DMA channel
active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device
So even though you can have at least  devices on a SCSI bus explain how
all  of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
to the ISAAT bus at the same time

Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book
but from their PC technical manual page 

The FDD adapter is buffered on the IO bus and uses the System Board
direct memory access DMA for record data transfers
I expect to see something similar for the PCAT HDD adapter  
So the lowly lowdensity original PC FDD card used DMA and the PCAT
HDD controller doesn't  That makes real sense

Heck if IDE used DMA then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than M RAM not working with their IDE
drives  M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble

There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer
to an area above the  mb area the DMA controller probably can't be
programmed that way anyways so there probably isin't a problem with this

Besides like I said before the FDD controller uses DMA channel 
And I don't yet believe that the HDD controllers any of them MFM RLL
etc don't also use DMA

Unfortunately there a LOT of such software  I also find it to be

	Very possibly but if it's still going to be backwards compatible
with the ISA bus it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA
implementation really is

	From what I've seen the PCI bus will just be a new bit MHz
intelligent bus ie bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like
not jumpers  Hopefully it'll get somewhere up there with the AMIGA

Greetings

        Please forgive me if this is FAQ If there is source on this kind of info 
please let me know I just got a  station around  in dimension
and I am thinking about upgrade it to a  or 

        The station has a power supply two floppy disk drives and the big
case I have SONY  monitor SyQuest drive Mac and maybe a cdrom
reader Mac for it Here are the questions I have so far
 Is there a  motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case
 The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
removed Can I use them to control these devices under  How much do I
have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work
 How can I make SyQuest SCSI and cdrom SCSI work on this station 
I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller builtin
What's quality of this board How much usually does a SCSI control cost
Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cdrom driver for the PC if
I can have everything hooked up OK What I want is a  motherboard a sound board to make it a MPC 
quality station How much would it cost to do that Is it worth the hussle
than just buy a new  station BTW I need to buy a keyboard for it too

Any input is welcome

Thank you

PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call as menus often use otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called 

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've misrememberred
them but I think you have to change the menu program if you have the sources
or add a TSR or system patch or something  As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time in fact about  secondsday better than DOS's clock

Facts

 A Netware Server A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered
down for three months
 From memory it has an  MB hard drive
 Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware  Level II Va
 When powered up the CMOS was wiped A technician examined it and 
pronounced the disk drive unusable

My investigations indicate that drive C is a type   cylinders  sides
When CMOS set this way COMPSURF runs happily with  bad blocks

I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive

Install will proceed successfully but when I try to boot the server it
reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware

Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present and there is one
disk drive or at least one large single unit 

Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready
errors

Questions

The software is Netware  Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen
SFT Netware  Level II Va However to configure netware for level II
mirrored or duplexed disks requires a second disk yes 

So how is the Novell Server A normally configured

 Can I install SFT Netware  Level II Va as Level I or is this what
is causing my serialisation error
 Is the Novell Server A normally equipped with two hard drives one of
which has failed
 Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive
 What else can cause a serialisation error
 What happens if the keycard fails
 Am I doing something wrong Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments
and guides

Thanks for your time

Apology

How do you do busmastering on the ISA bus

By initiating a DMA xfer  

Seriously busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability they don't use
the motherboards onboard DMAwhich is MUCH slower

ISA has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in  ISA system
try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or 
crashI forget

Their are  DMA channels in an ISA system   are bit   are
bit

The system uses DMA  a SoundBlaster uses DMA 

I could buy a busmastering XGA video card  a busmastering SCSI HA

In order for them to work properly I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers

I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA
I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either

I do know that on EISAMCA systems you can allow BM cards to use the
same DMA channel

Thanks

They don't have a conflict because technically LPT does not use
IRQ
     The Parallel printer processor the actual number escapes
me contains a printer control register which enables the chip
to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ
then onto the main processor as Int xF By default the parallel
printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore
no Int xF's will be sourced from the printer controller chip
thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ

     Note this applies to COM ports also which by default do not
route interrupts to the system bus although COM's software
usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port
activity easier than polling the serial UART thus probably
getting the sound card slighty confused

Windows may be a different story

Hi

I just got a problem I have a cheapo bps modem which I use to connect
to my university but I get too much garbage on the screen I do know it's
because the noise in the line I can actually hear it  So my question is
will an error correction protocol help to eliminate this garbage my modem
doesn't have any of these on hardware can a software implemented protocol
do the trick

Thanks

A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion so
he sent it back  Unfortunately the replacement also was distorted  I would
bet it's a common problem  The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors
is to actually look at the specific one you will buy as opposed to model
since monitor manufacturing even from Big Names still tends to produce
alot of monitors with visible defects

The JP on the Speedstar x is for those systems with bootup problems
If your system fails to bootup proprtly please pull off the jumper
block from jp This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar x
 
This is what my manual says about jp I never knew that it was there
but the card is a real ask kicker in my book It beats the hell out
of my junk Sony s to the point that I can't even use above x
mode muchSam
Some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill like driving a Sony
with a x that the monitor can't handle Or installing ns simms and
then finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state
adjustment to take advantage of the new ns simms that you just bought

I'm running MSDOS  with a menu system alive all the time  The machine
is left running all the time

Suddenly the date no longer rolls over  The time is reasonably accurate
allways but we have to change the date by hand every morning  This involves
exiting the menu system to get to DOS

I've started to notice the same thing myself I'm running DOS  and Win  so
I can fix it from the Windows Control Panel At times it is the date at
others the clock seems to be running several minutes behind where it should
be

Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance something like a 
clock has to make a Get Date system call Apparently the clock
hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this date advance automatically The
Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set and then
then advances the date

Anybody with more info

In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with localbusses
It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has Mb RAM onboard
It can do truecolor but I don't know what type of card it is
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around

My old system had a TSENG  I was pretty pleased with it so I
consider buying a WTSENG card I'd like to know a few things

	 How is the speedperformance in DOSWindowsUnixOS
	  Graphics  Text also compared to S cards for example
	 What resolutions including no of colors does it
	  support text  graphics
	 How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	 Compatibility with old TSENG 
	 Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card good or bad I'd like
to know If you have a better alternative than the W please tell
me about it

Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus  It actually  slows down your system

If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of PCweek in whihc they tested vlbus eisa and isa
busmastering cards

Is VLB busmastering bad because it stops the processor fetching from
external cache as well as main memory while the VLB card has the bus
How significant is the slowing effect

Hi all

  I would like to purchase CDROM drive The specs I would like to have is

    Applicable to Kodak multisession PhotoCD
    SCSI Interface
    Compatible with AdaptecB
    Does not need any caddies
    Cheaper    if possible
    Double Speeded

  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition
  so I would like to know all of your opinion  The above conditions
  are sorted by my priority
  I think NEC CDR is a little bit expensive but it DOES satisfy
  almost all of the above conditions The problem is that I do not know
  the compatibility with B Has someone succeeded to connect these
  NEC drives to B I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible
  with B adapter
  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated

Thanks in advance

To sum up when an accelerated board with MB VRAM True Colour x
AND A FAST VGA SIDE is available under  I will buy one

Me too

What's funny is when we really CAN buy such a product it probably won't
seem as mouthwatering as it does today  What No holograms Get outta
here

I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card It does x but
only  colour You may mock me but such cards will be here quickly enough

One of the odd things about the computer industry is that since you can
always wait and get something better some people wait forever  I know
people who have deferred updating their original IBM PC for a decade
because every time they look at what's available they see something better
coming down the road  I know people who've dumped their PCs into the
garage but haven't replaced them because they're afraid it isn't the
right time to buy  They just gave up using computers

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
is big enough to warrant changing For instance I'll be upgrading my  
to a DX  EISA VLB board RSN The performance difference under Linux
is great enough to be worthwhile At the same time I'll be buying a new
graphic card and new SCSI controller I'll be buying an S card 'cos they're
fast enough I have X drivers for them and it'll have MB VRAM just like
a Weitek  card It will also be MUCH cheaper When affordable MB cards
arrive I'll buy one

Personally my system at home needs a new disk subsystem a much
larger monitor a superfast graphics board by youknowwho a new
CPU board  I probably won't keep much more than the case and the
mouse  Come to think of it I don't like that mouse very much  So
when will I buy  When my dream products hit the market NO WAY  I'm
gonna buy as soon as I have the MONEY

Over the last year I've done much the same But now I need a  monitor more
memory MB just ain't enough a GB disk GB and no space left Oh
well stay single don't smoke and you may afford it this year

 I'm hoping that a simple solution exists eg an adapter that turns

I'm not sure if this will work but how about using one of those 'T' expanders
used in the lowprofile cases  They allow  slots staggered on either
side of the card  You can install it in the last slot and then probably 
have  or  sideways slots  This is actually how it is done in the low
profile cases  a standard motherboard the 'T' connector in one slot 
and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'  I guess you could do this at 
each end of the slots    to add even more  

The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them  no electronics
on it  The only downside  your case won't close but for a homebrew system
that may not be a problem

Don't know about performance though  I'll leave that discussion to the

I'm looking for a PC that is small and doesn't break apart if you drop
it on the groud 
It doesn't have to have graphics text only will do
just fine It doesn't have to be fast either  will do I hope
But you must stand a pretty hard enviroment without breaking apart
jumnping on it or trying to use it outdoor while it is raining and so
forth I need Kb of memory and a convinient way of loading
applications into it that I wrote myself floppy or somekind of
writeable cartridge 

Is there a PC like that And where can I get more info

interface between the controller and the memory

My advice Buy Megs of RAM save  and enjoy performance

Computer  mhz
Bus ISA  mhz
Drive Maxtor A  mb

I'd still like to here from people with VLBIDE
I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives
I still want to know if some most  IDE drives can handle bus speeds   mhz


I recently bought a Micron DX VLB computer and the the local bus
ide card was getting around ks transfer rates says norton  I caled
micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results  I was
told I would need norton  in order to get a true account of my ide
transfer speed

I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem
as though it's cranking along at much more than that but I also don't
know if I could tell the difference

I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS bus speed at the like
and noticed no significant change in performance

Contrary to what others might have thought I actually did have a SCSI drive

with the drive was a  interleave and a data transfer of about  ksec

I have had that drivecontroller coexist with MFM RLL and IDE drives
because the ST bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help

What's the word on the chipset  Is this a ROM bug specific 
to a specific brand using the Rockwell or is it the Rockwell
chipset itself

There were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much
expected with any FAXmodem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new  I'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems so you'll have to get it
from someone else

Someone Else could you please comment on that I have just bought
a Twincom DFi which has a Rockwell chipset It wasn't cheap
so I would like to hear of problems I'm likely to run into

However I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU as opposed to the DPU for an internal implementation
This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a
 interface  Without the  interface the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions like in windows  As far as I know the speed buffering
works OK for external modems if a  is used on the internal serial
port board

Phew I was lucky The Twincom internal version has a A and one
of the Rockwell chips is marked RCDP

But still I would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware
problems

I almost got a hernia laughing at this one

You'll probably get one when you realize that your  vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks

If anything SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local
With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus

Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus  It actually  slows down your system
Bus IDE  It must be real nice to get shafted by  bucks for the
extra cost of a SCSI drive then pay another  for a SCSI controller

Yeah there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics
And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB because it runs at
 Mhz and  bits Do people forget that the IDE was specifically
designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus We've seen
IDEs come out for EISA XT ISA and now even MCA but at all times
it was a  bit standard running at somewhere near  Mhz When
you run an IDE off of the VLB there's no way that you're running it
at  Mhz it would burn up Of course same goes for SCSI ESDI whatever
none of them run at CPU speed

The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to
a caching controller I suspect it would be much much better to
get a software disk cache instead since you get writecaching as well

because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big

I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as G

 You haven't heard Gateway customers griping about their monitors
 Where have you been I have never seen as many complaints on the
 net about anything else above the famous GW CS monitor flamefest

 The bulk of the GW CS monitor complaints to which I can add my complaint
 is for the older monitor that really comes from Tatung  After getting mine
 repaired by Tatung a year ago it is starting to flake out again  I'll be
 looking into NECDS and MAG F for my next monitors

Does anyone know when they stopped using those Tatung monitors I
bought my system in Feb ' and it definitely had the Mag monitor
That one and it's replacement failed within  months I gave up
and went to a CompuAdd store and bought a  monitor there I have
no idea who makes those No problems in about a year so far Knock

So does anyone know who makes the CompuAdd  flat screen monitor

Maybe you need to go into machinstall and set a refresh rate for

We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the

I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK
IO Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate The documentation
is no help at all As an example it says 'The serial port can be changed to
COM from COM by moving jumpers' but does not say what jumpers to move 

There are  banks of jumpers The first one is labeled as follows
C
C
S
P
P
G

The second bank is labeled IRQ and has the following labels
C
S


S
C
S

I have determined that the C  C jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as COM or COM The PP jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as LPT or LPT I am guessing that the G enables the game port and
the S SHOULD enable the second serial port but I can't get it to work I
have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success I assume that
this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports but I dont
know how  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

Hi

I just bought a Mitsumi CDROM drive and a SB Pro soundcard  The pin outs on
the CDROM lineout and the SB Pro CDIN are not the same  I am considering
taking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to
the linein input on the SB Pro  Will this work with multimedia software
that uses the CDROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CDIN pins on
the SBPro

Thanks

John

I read an article about the benefits of a VLB motherboard It said that a 
true VLB board supports bus mastering otherwise it is just as good as an ISA
motherboard

Doesn't all VLB motherboard support bus mastering I just bought a  VLB
and the tech manual does not explicitly state the words local bus mastering
but it said it supports bus master and slave modes Are these terms
synonymous

Thanks

I have just installed a Diamond Stealth  ISA card in
a 'DX system with K cache and  megs of memory
that gets about a  SI  CPU Benchmark rating  Using
the xx color driver under Windows I am getting a
Winbench Winmarks rating of only about  Million  Since
I have heard that others get to million for this card
I assume that something is very wrong with my setup

What are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this

I ran the Qualitas ASQ diagnostic program on memory and I noted
the following memory timings on my machine

  F                

Note two things on this chart

 The video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than
system memory  Are there wait states being inserted here and what would
cause that

 The EMS Page frame seems to be ridiculously slow even though
it is being mapped to the fast XMS memory in my system through
EMM  What's going on there

Note that my Stealth 's video BIOS at CCFF is being shadowed
through the AMI BIOS  

Any ideas on what might be happening here

I have just a few quick questions  Does anyone here have a  DLC
system a Cyrix  DX  Any problems with it  
Second how much should a Cyric DLC motherboard with
no RAM run me  
rdShould a total amatuer like myslef be able to perform
a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician or is it
beyond hope
thI hear that some if not all hard drives may require reformatting
if you switch them to another computer or motherboard as the case may
be  Is there any truth to this

Any replies would be greatly appreciated

The last I heard the author was having some problems in his immediate
family and had delayed the continuation of development for a time
This was some months ago

It's a shame  The driver is the best memory manager I have found
ANYWHERE  It doesn't require V mode like QEMM so it works with
Ultima   It doesn't take ANY memory runs then exits

If only the EMM provider were a little faster and more stable

Most importantly which Winbench version are you using  On my local bus ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro I've gotten various Winbench scores from  million to
 million winmarks depending on the version  Winbench  gives the most
optimistic scores  gives the least  A winmark rating is meaningless
without a corresponding version number

Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive a Seagate MB
I can look up the model number if it's important and I've been
trying to help him install it  I've got a vested interest since
my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed
He already has a Seagate MB IDE HD again I forget the model number
but I can find out

Anyway I can't seem to get the bloody thing up  I've managed to get
one or the other drive up with the other disconnected but not both
at the same time whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup 
never gets past the system test  The IDE controller's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives I think I've configured the CMOS
correctly the power's plugged in properly I even learned about the
masterslave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have didn't
know PCs were into SM  and I think I configured the jumpers
properly the MB one is the master the new MB one is the slave

The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong  I've
tried several combinations

controller  master  slave
controller  slave  master
master  controller  slave

None of them worked  Unfortunately I can't think of any others

Another possibility is that the MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C drive and D
drive setup info rather than drive  and drive  like most others
I've seen  Could this be confusing things

So I need HELP  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some
info for the CMOS setup the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card I cannibalized the cable it's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so
it looks like a serial connection now I be lost

Many many thanks in advance  This is practically an emergency I have
two papers to do on this thing for Monday  Help

I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you 
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
up for two hard drives from the beginning  I took him at his word and I 
have not tried to find out any more about it because I'm not going to back

HELP  I really got ripped off and I need some help unripping myself

I bought a Maxtor  mb ESDI HDD from HiTech for  then paid to
get it repaired for about another   Here's the deal  The thing works
fine  It low level formats etc without any bad spots at all  AND THEN
Jaws Music sectors start going bad  EEK  One at a time  Norton disk
doctor keeps marking some U and some C  That FIXES it  For about  minutes

Then next day when I run NDD on it again NO DICE more uncorrectable and
correctable sectors  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH  So I fugure Ok NDD's
just not being thurough enough I'll use Spinrite I heard that works well
What happens  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use  
AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH  NDD undoes it of course  The problem seams to
be getting worse and worse  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted
again the problem goes away for a while only to return in a day or so

I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD and I really
can't afford it

I'm using SMARTDRIVE and WINDOWS  I'm not using the  bit disk access
though I know that can create problems  The disk is using the second
option to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then  cyls
and everything else selected is standard maybe I need to use a different
head skew or something  I don't know

ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE TELL ME HOW HELP

Does your Stealth  have a row of DIP switches on the back plane

If so you have the older Revision A board and the winmark results

Anyone who knows this answer offhand please answer me by email 
quickly  

There is a pair of jumpers on one side and a set of  or  on the
other end  One is labeled sync  and one CD and E E E  

Whhich do I need to short or disconnect to get drive to operate
in slave mode  Give me a label or geographic
label as they have quite a few jumpers and I don't wanna try the
trial and error method 

I am using IDE I think this drive is SCSI compatible too

 got me a little but certainly not as much as I had hoped I am also looking for a way to 

What is the deal with the IDE transfer rates  Is anybody getting throughput
anywhere close to the plattercontroller rate  I haven't seen anything
even close to the MBsec limit of the IDE interface  These drives are 
noninterleaved aren't they

Here are the rates I get

 sequential read MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read sector
                    blocks sequentially from outside first track inward

                     mhz bus    mhz bus
                         
   MAXTOR LXT    KBsec   KBsec
   QUANTUM LPS   KBsec   KBsec

 disk buffer read same C program but rereads the same block repeatedly
                     so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive

                     mhz bus    mhz bus
                         
   MAXTOR LXT   KBsec  KBsec
   QUANTUM LPS  KBsec  KBsec

 CORETEST V transfer rate seems to agree with  above

                     mhz bus    mhz bus
                         
   MAXTOR LXT   KBsec  KBsec
   QUANTUM LPS  KBsec  KBsec

I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPSAT product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter
through the controller and out the IDE interface  Nowhere do I see
anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host
even though I SWEAR that's whats happening   Here are some relevent
quotes from the manual

  Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
    MBs maximum MBs minimum  My calculations show KBsec
   maximum and KBsec minimum  disk spins at  RPM with 
   sectors per track on the outside and  on the inside

  Single burst errors of up to  bits within one sector can be corrected
   'onthefly' in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of
   data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance  I take
   this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck

  For pagemode operations the datatransfer rate to and from the buffer
   RAM is up to  MBs This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface
   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a datatransfer rate of  MBs
   while the DCS simultaneously controls disktoRAM transfers
                 
So the thing can even do it's cache prefetch WHILE it's sending the
requested sector it has  KB read buffers for prefetching I guess
you could call that a cache 

So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks WHY am I getting a
measly KBsec when I should be getting around MBsec

Any of you harddisk engineers out there know


Wondering why my disks are so slow

If you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system most
offices or homes have positive ventilation you can generally run a
system without the cover for extended periods without a problem I'm
talking about completely removing the cover  not just leaving the slots
uncovered HOWEVER the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
is RF sheilding Operating a system without the full cover may create
problems with other equipment such as your neighbor's TV or Ham radio

fine only to compress C to have the thing choke spit out an unintelligable
warning and then hang  All that was left on either drive was autoexecbat
and configsys  Calls to Microsoft only met with busy signals  After reformatting
the drive I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall  or stay with a known
entity

The other may have been a marginal drive however his upgrade failed
he had to format a floppy disk at  format the drive and then reinstall

I make now claims since I was not driving at the time however be careful
and make sure you back important things up

I have a Gateway DXV with my  inch floppy as drive A  I
accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular
box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up rather than getting
the Nonsystem diskette message the machine hangs and the CMOS
gets overwritten luckily Gateway sends a print of the standard
CMOS settings with their systems  This only happens with a box
of preformatted Fuji disks that I have no other disks cause this
problem  If I reformat one of the Fuji disks the problem goes away
I did a virus scan scan v of the disks and found nothing

Anyone have any idea what is going on here  Hardware problem  A
virus that can't be detected  The system reading in garbage from
the boot sector

I'm running Linux on an  EISA system and I'm having what I think are
hardware problems  It could be software but I don't see why I'd be the
only one having trouble  I'd like some advice on how best to debug this

The symptom when I try to build gcc I get unpredictable and unrepeatable
results  Sometimes a o file is not in valid aout format  Recompiling the
file gives me a valid binary  Sometimes the compiler aborts or dumps core
but works fine when run again with the same input  Compiling the same
source files with the same arguments gives slight differences in a few
object files  Note that Linux unlike many other systems does not put
timestamps in object files so compiling twice should give bitidentical
results

I also have occasional filesystem corruption on my SCSI drive but that
could be caused by using development software  It could also be related to
my problems compiling  The compile problems are not caused by disk
problems I get the same results whether I do my work on an IDE or SCSI
disk

I've set the memory speed and cache write speed to the recommended values

Recommended for what DOS That is a junk


I suspect the external cache but I have no real evidence for this

The motherboard is a NICE SuperEISA with  KB writeback cache and a DX
 Mhz processor

What I'm looking for

	 A system test program to run under DOS or Linux

	Linux  gcc Fire up gcc to compile libc and kernel at the
	same time running XR


	 Suggestions about the cause of the problem

	Bad memory bad motherboard bad cache


	 Suggestions about how to debug the problem


	change wait state of RAM
	turn off turbo
	change bus speed
	swap RAM

 What's the difference between loading mousecom in autoexecbat and
 doing devicemousesys in configsys

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded mousesys will be
loaded during the configsys and therefor before the commandcom mousecom
will be loaded during autoexecbat and so after the commandcom

 which one is better

mousecom could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could  perhaps  be unloaded if no other driver is loaded after it
The working of both drivers is totally the same

When I ran dos I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexecbat
because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the
ones I needed during startup But with DRDOS this advantage is gone
because DRDOS lets you choose in configsys which drivers should be loaded

Hi
   I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs
for the sound blaster The first of which is a CMF voice editor which
is hopefully going to be available soon as soon as I can get it to 
an FTP site

Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play
the FM synth remotely The problem is that I have little or no info
on the SB midi port

I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines however
this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and
loss the of note velocity data byte

I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments
may help When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to
have all this information but my German is poor to say the least if anyone
has this book could they please mail me

My second request for help concerns standard file formats how can a file 
format be standard if you keep it secret  I need to know the file format 
for instrument bank files BNK and Roland music files ROL

Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA
or VGA monitors

Please Help You know it makes sense

I had this problem some time ago  Some BIOSes do not automatically install 
COM or COM in the port tables Programs like most modem programs which 
write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call 
fails Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER Put 
devicepfsys in your configsys or run pfcom from your autoexecbat 
This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS 
tables are updated It works great PF will also let you swap ports and 
such also if that is of any value to you

like that  The CDROM is locked too and the adaptec utilities don't seem to
recognize that I have a CDROM at that point
	Has anyone ever had this problem  Is there something abvious that I
am missing  And finally I was wondering if anyone using this setup could 
kindly post hisher configsys and autoexecbat

I am looking seriously at buying a  DX   from Gateway
I will probably buy it without a monitor as I've heard negative
stuff about Gateway monitors

I've also heard its tough to get through to technical
support

I'm seeking opinions on whether or not its wise to go ahead
based on criteria such as price warranty service general
ruggedness of the system reliability of the machine and of
Gateway too and so on

Please advise

Hi Netters

As promised here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v
People seem to be quite happy with the product There is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 
Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although
just as reliable  BYTE Magazine's conclusion   so it's hard to make
any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v 
However it seems that at  it is quite a buy

summary of replies

Hello Buddy

I do not have DD Gold  experience  I just ordered it  I currently have
DD  the last version  I am very pleased with its performance

Here is my suggestion

  If you do not have any compression software currently I would go with
	DOS 's compression  All the discussion on the net indicates that
	for  you get the compression built into the OS plus the other
	utilities that you would pay way more than  for  Besides you 
	are now at DOS whatever that means

  If you have DoubleDisk  already like I do the cost is 
	for the upgrade  After thinking about it and asking the net I
	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost
	I have never suffered from performance of DD  I have a ms HD with
	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format  It
	works great  Not delays  I think the A is better than B 
	arguements are a lot of bunk they are all comparable in performance
	I am looking forward to being able to LOADHIGH the DD sw  That
	has been an annoyance

  If you have Stacker etal currently I would not see it worth the
	effort to upgrade

Just my  

Regards
Mark Bagdy

I got the same mailer About  weeks ago I got DDG and installed it The
documentation was in my opinion easy to follow I used the automatic
installation not the custom and everything went smoothly

There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with max
 QEMM DDG has an uninstall unlike DOS if you need it My system has a
Mb hard drive before installing DDG I had Mb free After DDG I had
Mb free Pretty good statistics considering that my Mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion along with other drivers and
such

I have had no problems whatsoever I have noticed no slowdown other than it
takes a little longer to boot either in windows or dos So far I am a very
happy camper

The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein D  I assumed the game
was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the noncompressed
region of the disk  Since then the game has never given me a problem 
There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive
	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady 
around   This is lower than expected but about  size of my files 
are compressed image files and some large zip files  

If you have any more specific questions let me know

I bought it an have been happy with it  I use it on both MFM and IDE 
MB drives  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out  That is the
same product MSDOS  is shipping with  No problems with either
product

I am trying to put together a new PC with VESA Local Bus  I would like
to get VLB cards for Video and SCSI but I have heard of a problem with
bus mastering controllers on VLB  Something to the effect that they will
actually slow down a system  Anyone heard of this problem

Specifically I am interested in the Ultrastor F VLB SCSI controller
Before I shell out the bucks for this thing I would like to get the
straight scoop from someone who knows  Does anyone have this controller
Any problems with it

Is this expected or should I be investigating further why no bit
option appears


you  need to massage few switches in your systemini
in the virtual memory section flip the bitaccess switch on and the 
associated driver wdctl or some such switch on  this will enable
bit access but be sure you can use it as not all hard drives
and controllers support it

 reference to running ATI's Install Program and using

I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that
when an image is resized the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed  This causes digital multiscan
monitors like my MAG MXF to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections  For this reason I use the
factory defaults for positionsize on the ATI card
and adjust each mode individually only the first time
at the monitor  The MAG and many other multiscan
monitors has have the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is detected

Hey folks

Is it possible to short out your CMOS chip  I think mine is fried
These are the symptoms

I have to do the following to get my computer a Gateway DX
to boot

    Turn the power off

    Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip

    Turn the power on

    Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error

    Set up the CMOS

    Exit the setup with F  phoenix bios

    Ignore the diskette  seek error and press F

The computer then boots normally  Both hard drives are accessible
but the floppy drives are not

I can back up over the network and such but if I need to reboot
I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above  If I
simply CtlAltDel the computer hangs after the memory test

Does this sound like the CMOS chip is fried  Can I buy another one
Where

Thank you for your kind attention

john

For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution
     Network Inc and their Multimedia Kits

I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA MM Kit which
is bundled with the CDROM drive with ms access time Kb dtr
multispin multisession Photo CD capability etc and with the PAS
sound card etc if you are familiar with Insight you know the kit
I mean  I believe the drive is either a Texel ms or an NEC
ms but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
bundle at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight
answer as to which one ah yes one of the drawbacks of OEM

Other questions

 Excuse my ignorance but is Texel a reputable maker in the CDROM
  market  Or do you think NEC is the better drive

 Bottom line  Is this kit worth the money  Currently  for the
  TA and  for the TA

Alternatively I was thinking that the TA might be overkill for my
uses however I do want full multimedia capabilities Photo CD stuff
educational programs for my kids etc and considered the lowerend
TA kit and using the difference around  to get something
else useful like a tape backup drive unit

Basically I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED
these kits and whatever proscons you might advise preferably
directly to the email address below

Thanks

I just installed a DX CPU in a clone motherboard and tried mounting a CPU 
cooler on the chip  After about  hour the weight of the cooler was enough 
to dislodge the CPU from its mount  It ended up bending a few pins
on the CPU but luckily the power was not on yet  I ended up
pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU
cooler back on  So far so good

Have others had this problem  How do you ensure that the weight of
the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its
socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case

I believe that any VLEISAISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to bit EISA DMA where 'real' EISA DMA is bit  The
HINT EISA DMA has the  mb ram addressing limitation of ISA  For this
reason I would pass  I own one of these HAWK VLEISAISA and am look
ing to replace it for exactly this reason

Please doublecheck me on this  In other words call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true bit EISA
DMA

Other than this limitation the motherboard works quite well I am using
mine with DOS  Windows  and UNIX SR  Also with Adaptec a
EISA SCSI host adapter

	These LPT COM disk controller are call devices  There are

	does not require exclusive ownership ie it will share an
	interrupt with another device eg LPT

No  In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all nonlaptop PCs use
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt  This is due to
a screwup in the bus design  For example if your Soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number  then it must hold a certain bus wire to 
or  at all times depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt
This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 

When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's
because they're implemented by a single card

several of the Gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as
Gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent

I got the  MB Viper card  The first one was defective but Zeos
replaced it with only minor hassles  This one works fine  I haven't
noticed any problems in any of my applications  I also ordered it
because of all the complaints about the ATI a few months ago  Guess
you can choose either buggy stateoftheart stuff or robust average

In going with the modern trend the Orchid P card only supports  colors
in x mode without a driver  Of course this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes like most of my CDROMs 

This is not the case the ROM on the P supports VESA modes of up to
x in  colors  VESAcompliant applications should have no trouble
setting these modes But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group
just in case  Can't be too careful  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications
are failing to run lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA
they're looking at and don't use VESA calls VESA is still pretty new
Every new chip set confuses them

The supported resolutions really annoy me  You can do x at Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC FG they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic' and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL  But at x you are limited to Hz  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do Hz
at  it sure should be able to do it at   Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F VLB I currently have
and it will do xx Hz as well

I think we go to AT LEAST  Hz at xx and maybe more and
it's a function of the RAMDAC speed not the Power  We need to
fix the problems you've noted they were already on the list  If
you're really interested though take a look at the text file
PRESDAT which holds the data from which the choices in the
P monitor installation program are built  Working by analogy
you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right
combinations of refresh rates for your monitors  Keep a backup copy
of the file  Once you've built a new version of the PRESDAT
file run the P installation program INST and your new choices
should show up  This assumes you have the WEITEK v  drivers
You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of
the driver  is version   Microsoft uses this gimmick
too

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixelssecond  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card but they
were close to half of the OFVLB ie slower but that was running in a MHz
 ISA so the numbers aren't really comparable  The following numbers
were all obtained using a   MHz AIR motherboard UMC chipset with
 MB memory  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them and these tend to jump around a bit

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT who to my
knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the
Hercules GraphiteIIT AGX card look really good  So I'd take the
numbers with a ton of salt Texas Instruments did the same thing
with WINTACH trying to make the  look good compared to the
 as if anyone cared  It's safer though not safe to use
benchmarks from unbiased sources such as testing labs columnists
etc


Interestingly the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie
filled with crosshatching and Ternary Rops whatever they are  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe are a dead loss on the   

I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and
the results of anything else in the universe on these things

I give two
numbers for the  fonts because I think they are caching
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly 
 the speed of the OFVLB  Then the speed increases dramatically  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me

Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization  Windows has
hooks for it built right into the GDI  What's kind of silly is IIT's
use of a hardwired The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then
sat on a tack string in their driver  Not only is it useless in
real applications it lacks the programming elegance of the Bart
Simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the
mostrecently drawn string in offscreen memory and just do a
screentoscreen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a
second time in a row  We call it the Bart Simpson optimization
because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it he
could right I will not cheat on benchmarks a hundred times and be
done in half the time it would take to actually form each character

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all  Its just what
I saw when I ran them on my computer  I normally don't write disclaimers
but this time maybe I'd better  My testing is totally unconnected with my
work I program under UNIX on Decstations is done completely without the
knowledge blessing or equipment of my company

We don't have any lawyers  they're all working for Intel  There
used to be a lawyer in Montana who didn't but he died

Hi there  We just bought a  DX Gateway system with a  meg ATI
Ultra Pro video card  Everything seems to work fine except for the
Windows Drivers for x  bit and x and x  bit
modes  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup
and within minutes of use everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible  Naturally I called Gateway tech support to inquire
about this  The technician asked me about the drivers and I told him it
was version  build   He told me that the  and  bit drivers for
the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work  Is this true  If so I'm simply
amazed  How could this be  The strange thing is I would have expected
to see some discussion on here unless the subject has made the FAQ

One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
of the Windows Accelerator boards have working  andor  bit drivers
for Windows   I easily challenged him on that because I've been
running a Diamond x in  bit mode at home for  months now and I have
tested and used the  bit mode as well  He then backed off and said
Well Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer  Anyway I
just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
it  Any feedback will be appreciated

The system configuration is

Gateway  DX Local Bus
 Megs Ram
SCSI HD  CDROM
Ultrastor F Local Bus SCSI controller
ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with MB VRAM

 In my configsys I have aspidossys aspidisksys aspicdsys  In my

 and install the drive as drive F but when I switch to that drive and try a
 dir I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something
 like that  The CDROM is locked too and the adaptec utilities don't seem to
 recognize that I have a CDROM at that point
 	Has anyone ever had this problem  Is there something abvious that I
 am missing  And finally I was wondering if anyone using this setup could 
 kindly post hisher configsys and autoexecbat
 

Hi

One of the ASPIdrivers I think it's the ASPICD supports a NORST
paramter which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads This
fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptectosh

Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems

 The ad specified  million colors at x resolution with MB
   of VRAM which is what I have This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version  and drivers version  A max of K
   colors are supported at x and x resolutions with MB
   VRAM

 With the K color choice I notice two minor irritations

   a Under NDW when an entry in a list is highlighted such as in an
      Open menu and then is deselected a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be

   b With Word for Windows when you use shading in a table the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading for example if you
      shade the cell as  the display is  the printout is OK

 The big killer bug is using the Borland C Integrated Development
   Environment The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon or use the Debugger option in the Run command and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode as it is designed
   to do The screen goes haywire and is largely unreadable The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled

   Through trial and error I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do AltSpacebar followed by the letter
   R This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen and it
   does this satisfactorily I wish I didn't have to do this

   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode
   
   The problem is not my monitor The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one

I still like this video card and am hoping its problems will be
remedied they do offer a  year warranty

the computer the geometry of the drive On my  you set it in the BIOS but
I doubt that's how it's done on an XT I thought it might be software with
the controller card but the IDE card for XT's that I saw didn't come with

I'm in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix  got a new hard disk
discovered my BIOS doesn't have a type  and I would like know where I
can purchase one of these things

I checked with the motherboard manufacturer for the curious it's from
Mylex and hearing the  figure prompted me to at least try to shop
around

Problem is I don't know where to shop around for something like this

I have heard that there's a BIOS speciality shop in the South Bay and it's
been alleged that they advertise in the MicroTimes

Did find the MicroTimes didn't find the ad or the shop

So can anybody help me out on this quest

To anybody who replies to this Thanks in advance

I believe that any VLEISAISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to bit EISA DMA where 'real' EISA DMA is bit  The
HINT EISA DMA has the  mb ram addressing limitation of ISA  For this
reason I would pass  I own one of these HAWK VLEISAISA and am look
ing to replace it for exactly this reason

Please doublecheck me on this  In other words call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true bit EISA
DMA

Other than this limitation the motherboard works quite well I am using
mine with DOS  Windows  and UNIX SR  Also with Adaptec a
EISA SCSI host adapter

 I have a Gateway with a  floppy The drive only reads files it
 wrote to the floppy Floppies that have been formatted and 
 contain files from other machines are unreadable Also  floppies
 that were written by this defective floppy drive a long time ago are
 also unreadable
 
 This sounds like a head alignment problem

Too right it does

  How does one go about
 fixing it Are there alignment screws that you can adjust

The VERY VERY FIRST thing you do is make sure that ALL files on
the floppies that you can currently read in the drive which aren't
already on your HD or another floppy if you have two floppy drives
get copied to your HD andor to a floppy in your other drive

If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye  Well you can try to remisalign the drive back
to read your floppies but don't count on be able to do so

Generally head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair
shop though there arehave been DIY guides

 Hi there  We just bought a  DX Gateway system with a  meg ATI
 Ultra Pro video card  Everything seems to work fine except for the
 Windows Drivers for x  bit and x and x  bit
 modes  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup
 and within minutes of use everything on the screen is totally
 unintelligible  Naturally I called Gateway tech support to inquire
 about this  The technician asked me about the drivers and I told him it
 was version  build   He told me that the  and  bit drivers for
 the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work  Is this true  If so I'm simply
 amazed  How could this be  The strange thing is I would have expected
 to see some discussion on here unless the subject has made the FAQ
 
 One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
 of the Windows Accelerator boards have working  andor  bit drivers
 for Windows   I easily challenged him on that because I've been
 running a Diamond x in  bit mode at home for  months now and I have
 tested and used the  bit mode as well  He then backed off and said
 Well Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer  Anyway I
 just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
 it  Any feedback will be appreciated
 
 The system configuration is
 
 Gateway  DX Local Bus
  Megs Ram
 SCSI HD  CDROM
 Ultrastor F Local Bus SCSI controller
 ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with MB VRAM
 DOS 
 Windows 
 Mach  drivers version  build 

I have been able to successfully use both  and  bit color modes on my
Gateway system although my setup is less complicated than yours  It sounds as
if you may have a hardware conflict or problem  Is your memory aperture above
M  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a
variety of systems  Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you
fix it

       I am buying a Quantum LPSAT  MB hardisk and is deciding a

       than  bit IDE HDDFDD controller card

No VLbus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE  The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus and if
you hook it to VLbus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two
meaning ISA speed

       I hear that
       the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller

On the other hand I wouldn't expect it to be slower

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin  I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is or even better what the various
switches and jumbers are used for

Anyway here's  description of the card  It is a bit card although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the bit extension are connected
to anything  It has  NSAN chips in sockets and  corresponding
connecters labeled COM  COM  There is also an external female connector
with  pins  There are  banks of  switches  banks of  switches and
 jumpers  I believe that I have determined by following traces that
SW and SW  switches in all control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports  SW are for IRQ SW are for IRQ and SW
are for IRQ  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow
	     
The only identification printed on the board is MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD
across the bottom  There is a box for serial number but it is blank
Immediately below the words SERIAL NO but not in the box left for
the SN are the numbers   

Anyone have any clues  Your help is greatly appreciated

Hi

I recently switched my  drive to A The problem is while I can read and
write to both the new A and B correctly I can't boot from a floppy in A
I've checked the CMOS settings it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot 
Order AC 

Once I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A I got a
message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive It didn't work
When I do have a systems disk in the A drive this is what happens
 Poweron and Memory Test
 A light comes on
 B light comes on followed by a short beep
 HD light comes on for an instant
 B light comes on again then nothing happens

The light goes off there is no disk activity of any kind and the screen 
blanks I can't even use ctrlaltdel

Any suggestions

Have you checked  The setting of drive A to  M floppy
						 The setting of drive B to  M foppy
						 The cable connecting the two drives to
						the controller card I can't remember which
						two wires are swapped but they determine
						which is drive A  b

I hope this is of some help

Hi  I am trying to set up a Conner  and a Quantum AT drive  I have
the conner set to the master and the quantum set to the slave doesn't work
the other way around  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a 
floppy but the drives will not boot themselves  I am running MSDOS  and
have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos and is formatted with system
files  I have tried all different types of setups and even changed IDE
controller cards  If I boot from a floppy everything works great except
the booting part   The system doesn't report an error message or anything
just hangs there  Does anyone have any suggestions or has somebody else
run into a similar problem  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios
on one of the drives is this possible  Any suggestionsanswers would be
greatly appreciated  Please reply to

 I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one
 I already had  My problem is this  My system only had a IDE cable
 for one drive so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors
 on it and consequently have to switch cables  The problem is 
 the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin  on the cable
 with both pin  on the drive itself and pin  on the IDE card  But
 for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
 in the cable to align these  

Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin  labeled on the printed
circuit board this is sufficient to determine which side is which  If your
IDE drive does not have a label then you can look for a polarization notch in
the receptacle the connector on the drive with the pins  If the receptacle
is center polarized that is it has one rectangular notch about  mm wide
positioned in the center of one side then you can identify pin  as follows
look into the pins with the notch at the top pin  is at the top right  On
all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector  As for which pin
is pin  on the controller well you can use the same criteria but look hard
for the labelling of any pin  Once you know which end pin  are on or pins
   the oposite end then you are all set  All you need to do is keep
the pin  end connected to the pin  end  You don't even have to look at the
cable itself  Just trace the pin  side of the cable through  Usually the
pin  of the cable is identified by a different color red usually  But
beware  many cable makers are not very careful about this  I have seen cables
with pin  being the one marked red  Of course with nonpolarized connectors
this doesn't matter  you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide
which side is pin 

 Secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them
 I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
 the drives  Does it matter which I plug into the master drive
 and which into the Slave  any help appreciated  thanks

It doesn't matter what gets plugged where  But it does matter how the drives
are jumpered  There will be amongst other options two jumpers that you
should be concerned with on BOTH drives  One jumper will select whether the
drive is the slave or the master  If it is the master then a second jumper
selects whether or not a slave is present  You will have to consult the 
docuementation that came with you drives  If you do not have docuementation
then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have
one  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like
yourself  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers  If you don't
have convenient access to a fax machine then you can usually get voice
help  Or post the specific question to this group  I probably won't be
able to help you

Good Luck

So the lowly lowdensity original PC FDD card used DMA and the PCAT
HDD controller doesn't  That makes real sense

Actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' or whatever the instruction is called is
quite efficient single instruction goes as fast as the
controllercpu know how to use the bus Since the  wasn't cached
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance and
it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of CPU cycles for 'computing' as does the 'rep insw' sequence

The floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the CPU
for floppy data transfer as was done on the PC Jr by the way really
does stink

Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance something like a 
clock has to make a Get Date system call Apparently the clock
hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this date advance automatically The
Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set and then
then advances the date

Anybody with more info

There are two 'problems'
 the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only  bit
    for day increment so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the
    meantime and
 the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
    call from ANYBODY after the wrap indicator has been set So
    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by
    the DOS 'kernel' which is the only part of DOS which knows how to
    increment the date the day wrap indication is normally lost
My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the
clock in order to display the time and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost Even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' which I think is indicated by a nonzero
value in AL there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS
about it so that DOS can update the day The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly  Possibly though the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS
calls for time because DOS is not reentrant and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other DOS call

Have anybody succeded in converting a atari monomchrome monitor into a
mono VGA monitor If so please let me know exactly how you did and what
graphics card you used
I wish I could help  I posted a similar question about two weeks ago
I got no response at all  I've asked locally at my friendly Atari store
I was told that it should be possible but that they had no idea how
it might be done  Nor did they particularly care to investigate

Please if anyone has any suggestions post them


   You might try asking on one of the compsysibm echos the best one
may be compsysibmpchardware  I say this because the conversion
seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor than
an Atari user who already can use the monitor unless maybe they
want to really go wild  converting the monitor to VGA then
using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon 

   As for graphics cards assuming that the Atari monitor can be
modifiedadapted to handle VGA signals you should probably be able
to use any VGA card at least with a res around x  I haven't
tried this but that would be my guess

				Robert Anisko

you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways  it may be cheaper
to go that route than to do the conversion besides with the Falcon and
beyond VGASVGAmultisync monitors will probably be the way to go

Is it possible to buy a serial IO card with the  UART's built in
rather than having to buy them separately and socketing them in

My current IO card uses 's correct number The braindead ones anyway
It also controls two floppy drives and two IDE hard drives

Ideally I'd like to get a new multi IO card that had  serial ports with
's and could also control another  IDE HD's It would have to have
configurable addresses for both the serial ports and the IDE controller so
it could coexist with my existing card

Does such a beast exist Now the hard part  where can I get one in Australia
preferably Brisbane

Thanks

 	I recently purchased the Toshiba  CDROM  I own an Adaptec B
 SCSI card and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS  It

One of the ASPIdrivers I think it's the ASPICD supports a NORST

fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptectosh

i've been using an identical setup except for the tower config

There is explicitly NO WARRANTY
that the given settings are correct or harmless I only collect I do
not check for myself There is always the possibility that the
settings may destroy your hardware



Since I hope however that only wellminded people undergo the effort of
posting their settings the chance of applicability exists If you should
agree or disagree with some setting let me know immediately in order
to update the list

If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS andor
jumper settings please mail them to me for the next update of the list

Only IDE ATBus Harddisks will be accounted for
If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of
cylinders If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set
 There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it

Another statement maybe right
IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone The precomp is a builtin parameter
and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark

The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board often only a
jumper number JP means the jumper '' A zero means that the jumper
is left open a one means that the jumper is closed

 When I installed a Conner CPF  MB as master and a WD Caviar 
  MB as slave both with and without the CP jumper the Caviar had
 seemingly normal behaviour However when doing writes to the Caviar once
 in a while it would overwrite directories etc Using FASTBACK was almost
 impossible
 
 The workaround is to install the Caviar as the master and the Conner
 as the slave

BIOS SETTINGS

BIOS setting for the MET in my system is  cylinders  sectors
and  heads

 I was trying to set my IDE drive in the subject above to a slave drive for
 A Conner MB drive and contacting the support company gave me this answer which works The factory default on SW is On Off Off Off Off Off  This sets the drive to be a single drive Setting SW to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive SW has been set to On Off Off On  all along

Link Options

   In order to install the Rodime Ro A series drives the dumpers for 
the singledual drive and LED operation on the drive need to be set as 
described in the relevant product specification
   I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master
   In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a
Slave This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives 
when performing diagnostics
   There are four links LK LK LK and LK adjacent to the  way 
interface connector They have the following functions and are described 
in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper 
described nearest the  way interface connector

LK LED 
     When fitted this jumper connects the LED drive to pin  of the
     interface This allows a LED to be connected to the interface An
     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with
     the LED when this option is selected The value of the resistor will
     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 
     Ohms ot  Ohms

LK Dual Drives
     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single
     bus It fallows communication across the  way interface connector
     indicating to the Master drive the presence of a Slave

LK Master
     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master If
     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be
     jumpered in this way

LK IOChRdy
     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive it is 
     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher
     data transfer rate than the drive ie greater than  MBytes per
     second when using  interleave This jumper is not normally 
     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than  MBytes per
     second

   There are four possible MasterSlave configurations in which a drives
may be jumpered

     Master single drive with LED on interface		LK  LK fitted
     Master single drive without LED on interface	LK only fitted
     Master dual drive without LED on interface	LK  LK fitted
     Slave dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted
     Master dual drive with LED on interface		LK LK  LK fitted
     Slave dual drive with LED on interface		LK only fitted

   The Master drive will delay powerup for approximately two seconds to
reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used

   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the  way 
connector at the other end of the drive This LED driver is not affected
by the link options An internal current limiting resistor is on the 
drive for this LED driver Refer to the product specification for further
details

Maybe there are  kinds of Caviar's floating around 

If your jumpers read MA SL and SI then use
Jumper	SI	MA	SL
Single

There have been reported difficulties in using WD Caviar as Master and
NEC drives as slave  the other way it works
 When I installed a Conner CPF  MB as master and a WD Caviar 
  MB as slave both with and without the CP jumper the Caviar had
 seemingly normal behaviour However when doing writes to the Caviar once
 in a while it would overwrite directories etc Using FASTBACK was almost
 impossible
 
 The workaround is to install the Caviar as the master and the Conner
 as the slave

I recently bought an AMD   The motherboard booklet says
the board is a  WBH  I have  x simms on board  The machine
also uses a Super IDE IO Card model PT of course niether
the motherboard or the IO card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers
are I'm also using a Trident C SVGA card

	Anyway that's all of the pertinent info I can think of
My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays Parity Error 
System Halted messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error
Checking to disabled or enabled in the setup of the bios makes sense
Its AMI bios so it must be an AMI board

	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the
SIMMS but I keep getting the same error more frequently now  It all
worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home figures

	I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even reinserted them
in reverse order making sure that the connections were solid

	My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controllerserial

I think you mean the ethernet numbers  The  byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number ESN assigned to each ethernet board in existence
This is a physical layer concept  The IP address is a higher layer protocol
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some unknown to you or
I physical identification scheme number

But to answer your question assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number  Of course the
manufacturer can always retrofit a board but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that

If your question is actually referring to the IP address it is most definetly
changable  But it is strictly software

I think it's impossible to let ATBus operated too much more than

clock to  MHz but the HD stopped when it boot  So it's correct
that CLKn means how many wait states

   Sm 

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed  I have a DX I set my bus divider to CLK that is close to MHz  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed  And my system work flawlessly under this setting  And you know what when I go to CLKMHz BUS my HD refuse to boot  

Just my  cent

Yep  I've done this too  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push
down on the latch of each pin and then pull it out of the connector  Label
each one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled
them out  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals

Hello

I'am almost ashame to ask this question It really looks like a FAQ but couldn't
find the answer Anyway

The original IBMPCXT  or  key keyboard is in my opinion still the best
keyboard around Function keys on the right place eh left place firm click
etc Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern  AT clone

I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality Ie the
typematic repeat rate is programmable etc It seams to me that the pins 
electrical specs of the old and the new keyboard are however the same 
Maybe the communication protocol is different 

Please answer by email Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible
In that case i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology

Thanks

      Can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if I get OS I might 
    need an SCSI controler rather than an IDE  Will performance suffer that
    much  For a MB or so drive  If I don't have a tape drive or CDROM
    Any help would be appreciated
 
 So when you've got multitasking you want to increase performance by
 increasing the amount of overlapping you do
 
 One way is with DMA or bus mastering  Either of these make it
 possible for IO devices to move their data into and out of memory
 without interrupting the CPU  The alternative is for the CPU to move
 the data  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
 bus mastering
  
 How do you do busmastering on the ISA bus
 
 IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface
 created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data
 bytes with no DMA
 
 If we're talking ISA AT bus here then you can only have  DMA channel
 active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device
 So even though you can have at least  devices on a SCSI bus explain how
 all  of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
 to the ISAAT bus at the same time

Think

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices This is typically used in a multitasking OS to
start transfers on several devices While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it This is typically a ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time

 
 Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book
 but from their PC technical manual page 
 
 The FDD adapter is buffered on the IO bus and uses the System Board
 direct memory access DMA for record data transfers
 I expect to see something similar for the PCAT HDD adapter  
 So the lowly lowdensity original PC FDD card used DMA and the PCAT
 HDD controller doesn't  That makes real sense

 A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't
about a socalled Videostreamer This is an interface
between a PC's parallel port and any videorecorder for
backing up your data on a videotape The company DataSave
claims that it can store up to  GB on a  minutes tape
                         

It costs DM  about USD  I think

My question is
 Does anybody use this product if yes how many bytes 
 REALLY fit on a  minutes tape  GB sounds quite
 unbelievable to me 

However any comments on the interface are appreciated
Please mail your replies directly to me I will sum up
if neccesary Thanks in advance

Well I tried this method based on responses from several people  Either
I am a klutzprobable or they have changed the connector  I ended up having
to destroy the connector put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and 
then plug them into the SB connector in the correct order  It works great 
this way so this turned out just fine  It certainly sounded easy based on
other people's experiences but my attempts did not go too well

I have a Mhz ISA Board with kbyte Cache and  Megs
RAM I just bought the new soundblaster  and tried to 
install the card The sb uses bit DMA channelI could
select between channel  to  It is the first card I ever
installed that uses bit dma transfer After I tested
the card the first time the computer crashed and I got a
parity errorsystem halted This happens either from dos as
also from windows So it seems that my  bit dma channels
are not working properly they are there because testsbexe
recocnize them and tests them ok until first access 

Well does anybody know a solution for this problem or a
special test program for dma problems I eliminated the 
problem temporaly by using only  bit dma channel but it
makes the system slow

Thanks for your help
Yours Markus

We are looking for some telephone interfaces boardsboxes to hook up to a
computer which will be running one of UnixDOSMac

We want to be able to communicate with a database on the computer using DTMF
and the telephone interface  It would be nice if the telephone interface
came with a set of library routines preferably in C which we could use to
write our own programs

We would also like to be able to record and playback voice using the
computer's hard disk for storage

Does anyone here have any experience with or knowledge of any products
which might meet our needs

Please reply via EMail and I will summarize if there is interest

Thanks

	Hi everyone
	I have a question regarding my stack on my pc  I am programming 
in Turbo C  and my program is rather large model large too  I keep 
getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the 
program When I compile the program it says I have  meg of RAM so 
I can't seem to explain why it crashes

All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and
after a while of sitting it will screw up all the variables This leads
me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing  

Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions
that do not return anything

	I have been working on this problem for days and I would really
appreciate any responce  If this is not the correct newsgroup I will
gladly repost but this is the only I could find

Thanks in advance

You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error
Checking enabled or disabled  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error
when it's enabled and not when it's disabled  How high will the count go on
the memory check at bootup before this error occurs  Does the system beep
at all if so what's the pattern of beeps  The error could be occuring in
Cache memory not so likely or video memory as well as the simms

The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board
manufacturer either  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies
among others that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some
simm sockets to make your board  I tend to doubt your problem is with your
IDE controller also

Anyway perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better

What was sudgested to me was to put a toriod transformer on the line
This is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local
electronics shop a toroid core is a ceramicmetal donut and wind the
telephone line in through the center of the core and out around the
ouTside five or six times This is a easy and cheap fix that does not
have the hassels of having to use sofware to fix a hardware problem

IDE drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave
If it is a master then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present
These must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec
ification  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem  It is
probably not the controller  IDE controllers all support exactly two
drives maximum  Check those jumpers

Has anyone successfully put both SCSI and IDE hard drives

controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS

	turn off cache

GCC and other big programs seemed to crash about  of the time for me
gcc gave something like program as got fatal signal  and when doing
anything past the complexity of elvis kermit etc I got kernel general
protection faults at least once a session

I disabled my cache as suggested and bingo Linux is as stable as a rock
it hasn't given me a core dump or kernel error yet

Does any one know why the cache would do something like this

 I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you 
 perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
 up for two hard drives from the beginning  I took him at his word and I 
 have not tried to find out any more about it because I'm not going to back 
 everything up just to add another HDD  If anyone knows for sure what the 
 scoop is I would like to know also  Thanks in advance also
 
 Bill Willis
 

 do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the
   executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer  These are
   available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
   fee

 In addition to the masterslave jumper on an IDE drive there is also
   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present  Get it right

 The cabling is not an issue as long as pin  goes to pin  goes to
   pin   No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable  Be sure of pin 
   on all three components  do not make assumptions guesses are ok
   but assumptions are bad

 If the cable and jumpers are correct and the CMOS setup is correct
   then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format
   I have NEVER personally found this necesary but perhaps there is
   something gone wrong with the data on the disks  Probably not but
   I understand your predicament  You will probably throw salt over
   your shoulders wear funny clothes and do a spooky sounding chant
   while dancing around the room if someone said it might help

Good Luck

Does anyone have a source for DX Motherboards  I've
been calling around the local stores and everyone appears
to be only stocking the DX or SX motherboards

How difficult is it to modify a DX motherboard to run at
 MHz  Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a
slower part

HELP  This morning I turned on my computerto be greated with a popping
noise from the monitor  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and to
my disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke  Great
I opened it up to see what I could see it's  years old no warrenty for me
On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorly
fryedburnt to a crispcan't even tell what value it is  This is the
only pjhysical damage I can find  But to my knowledge resistors don't
just randomly blow  What could have happened  A voltage regulator
problem  The fuses nearby are intactgreat job  I have  thoughts as
to why it did this  One over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier for
about  weeks although it was halfway across the room  Could moisture
done this  I last used it over a month ago  Second as most people
doI never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor  I have
everything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang on
with it  Now is this bad  Should I quit doing it  Is my system
getting too much power or varrying power this way when activated

Nowbefore I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor to
see what happens  But I have no idea what value it is  Or even if that
would fix thingswould it just blow again  Right now when I plug it in
and turn it on I don't even get the power LEDa power supply prolem
Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop 
It is resistor R  It's near the metal shield that
shgieldssomethingnear a large black electrolytic capacitor  It's on
the right most pc board  The monitor is an Imtec N from mid
Does someone have schematics for this  Or would someone be willing to
take theirs apart and see what value R is  Basically what the hell
should I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time

I have crosposted this article  Please respond via email with any help or
suggestions  Also does anyone have Imtecs phone or address  My manual
lacks either from what I can see  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY
Needless to say with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanning
groups while bothering my friend to use his computermodem

  What is a  UART

I don't know the exact meaning of UART but I think it is something like
Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter Normally the older boards have
a  or  UART on board Those chips generate an IRQ for every char
they received The  UART has an internal  byte buffer so  with the
right software installed  it generates an IRQ every  chars 

  What does it do for highspeed modems
  Is it necessary for k or higher throughput

If you ran dos you don't need a  because dos runs only ONE task at a
time and the whole cpupower could be used for the transfer But if you are
running a multitasking OS such as OS Unix etc  windows    the
cpu cannot work the whole time with one task 

The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts

  Is it only for internal modems

NO The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board
whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port
which has the UART on board

 If you have any experience with  or higher speed modems please
 let me know what you think  Also any particular brand name reccomended
 or will a cheapo clone do just a well

I use a ZyxelB with a UART under COHERENT  I'm very satisfied
with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem

Recently I have been getting a CMOS Checksum error when I first turn on my
computer  It doesn't happen everytime I turn it on nor can I predict when it
is going to happen  I have an AMI BIOS and all of the setting are lost for
example the drive types and the password options  However the date and time
remain correct  If anyone knows what can be causing this please let me know

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing  this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong along with most other of the CMOS data Try 
replacing the battery

If however your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery If this isn't possible make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day this will keep the capacitor 
charged I'd opt for the battery change though

It's also possible but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the CMOS If your battery seems okay get a virus scanner and
check out your system

Hello

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card the older version
with the DIP switches on the back  I have two problems

  I've lost the manual

  I have it in a machine with a network card and
    everything works fine until I run windows when
    the network connection dies

    In case it's important the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet Bit compatable card  It's IO
     address is E and it's RAM base address is
     D  It's also using IRQ 


    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out but with no manual I don't
know the Bboard number

    If you can please help me with as many of the following
as possible

a  Send me the Diamond BBS number
b  Email or post the DIP switch settings for the card
    or fax them to me at  
c  Tell me what I'm doing wrong so I can magicly get
    everything working

    Any help at all would be much appreciated

                Thanks in advance

 No  In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all nonlaptop PCs use

 This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 
 
 When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's
 because they're implemented by a single card

Interesting  Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster

you that they are both set to IRQ  and that I have no problem  My

Has anyone successfully put both SCSI and IDE hard drives
on the same system

I would like to know as well since I just bought a MB Seagate IDE
drive and want to add it to my computer a fouryearold Gateway
 which currently has an MB Seagate SCSI drive  The SCSI
controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS
setup ie both hard drive settings are listed as Not installed
and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders  I wondering if
this is a problem  Also I remember how when I helped my cousin
install his second IDE drive we had to define a masterslave
relationship for them do I need to do something similar here

I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the boot drive

Same here

Any help would be appreciated since I intend to install this drive
ASAP I'd like to know what to do and what not to do before I start
Thanks

I have been using both IDE or MFM and SCSI drives for years  I have 
IDE and  SCSI on one system and the other with  IDE  SCSI disk and 
 SCSI CDROM  I currently using ALWAYS IN SCSI card but I also have
a Future Domain a Western Digital SCSI card and I work with an ADAPTIC 
before  As I recall all these cards can support boot and floppy drive
However to use with other controller IDE MFM the boot drive has to
be the IDE or MFM  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other 
controller in the system  If you guys only have  drives  IDE  SCSI
just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup  Make sure you can boot from it
Then set up the SCSI controller IRQ DMA etc Set the SCSI drive to 
ID   Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far  Only if you 
have more than  drives then you need driver for the third drive and so
on  If you have more question email me I will try to answer it
Good Luck

William

I ran into the same problem when I upgraded from a  modem to a 
modem Any time I give the modem a reset command ATZ while in windows
The computer locks up If I give the ATZ command in DOS it will work My solution 
was to not give the modem the ATZ command thru windows In the PROCOMM 
install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible  modem ATZ
was not included in the initialization string  it works fine I called MS
about this  they didn't have a clue as to what the memoryinterupt conflict 
could be The lockup accures using ANY windows comm program that gives the ATZ
command

I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks  and ideally would like to
be able to keep  to  floppies busy simultaneously on a single PC
Yes I know that services to do this exist 

I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active
at a time I know that some controllers are available that can handle  
floppies with serialized access I know that microchannel machines can keep 
more than one floppy active simultaneously But does anyone have a controller 
for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep  to  floppies going
How about for an EISA machine

If the limitation is a software limitation I can work around that by using
OS  on my PC

I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one
I already had  My problem is this  My system only had a IDE cable
for one drive so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors
on it and consequently have to switch cables  The problem is 
the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin  on the cable
with both pin  on the drive itself and pin  on the IDE card  But
for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
in the cable to align these  
Secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them
I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
the drives  Does it matter which I plug into the master drive
and which into the Slave  any help appreciated  thanks

Just poke out the little pins in the connector and then replace them in

Is this reverisible  You can unpoke as easy as you poke

Stupid question from a new IBM PC user

I'm going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 

What is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD

The GW DXV comes with a MB Western Digital IDE drive
I asked how much more for the Seagate MB SCSI drive

The guy asked me Why are you going with SCSI  I was lost for an answer
I just said I know Seagate better as a company from a satisfaction point
of view

Are SCSI drives faster than IDE  I'm not buying my GW for another  months
or so but this is a question that has bugged me for a while

Windows all act as if the port isn't there  It's not an IRQ conflict because I can swap the IRQs for COM and COM and COM still works and COM still doesn't

I actually noticed this problem when trying to install  additional ports a BOCA high speed SP card  The behavior with the BOCA card was exactly the same eg it would work as COM COM or COM but not as COM

This has the smell of an IO port conflict but I can't imagine with what  There are no other expansion cards installed in the machine other than the video card and Gateway would have to be pretty stupid to have the onboard COM conflict with something else on the motherboard

Has anybody else had this problem


I ran into this about six months ago  My system is a GW DXV
 megs RAM Meg ATI GUP VLB It seems the problem is that the ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM port for some reason so only
COM are available  I believe this is documented somewhere in the

worked fine  Then I split the line from the jack in the other room ran
the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer  Then
I got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem
Now when I try to use the modem QuickLinkII says No dialtone  The phone
plugged into the back of the computer works fine  I tried unplugging the
phone but still no dice  Is it that the phone line was split too many
times  I don't understand how this could be a problem since the phone
worked fine  Please note none of the software or hardware parameters
were changed only the phone line itself  Is my new modem faulty  What
can I do

 ps  I'm intending to use the cable for PCtoPC transfers via LapLink or
 Telix  Ideas and info gladly accepted

I do not have specific knowledge of LapLink or Telix but my recommendation
for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null
modem cable  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't
really a standard for PC to PC communications  The following is a tutorial
I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS and null modems
but you should still check your software

I will eplain a couple of details of RS  RS is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment DTE and DATA
Communications Equipment DCE  RS spells out the voltage levels the
connector type the pinouts and the signal protocols  The connector is
a DB but IBM has set an alternative standard of DB  The primary
signals are Transmit Data TD Recieve Data RD and Signal Ground SG
There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE
For example the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the Data Terminal Ready DTR signal  DTR is an
output on the DTE and an input on the DCE  Similarly the DCE announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready DSR
signal  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE  Ok that's
five signals there are only four more of interest  The Request To Send RTS
signal is an output from the DTE and an input to the DCE that is used
to ask the DCE permission to send data  If the DCE agrees it sends an ok
via the Clear To Send CTS signal  For completeness the CTS is an input
to the DTE and an output from the DCE  The other two signals of interest
are Ring Indicator RI and Data Carrier Detect DCD  These are both inputs
to the DTE and outputs from the DCE  RI is just what you would expect 
a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the DCE  This is rather specific to the modem  telephone line setup
DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the connection has been established
ie the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE  There  that's it  Oh
there are many other RS signals defined but they are obsolete  I have
explained the nine signals that are on a PC  The pinouts are as follows

Name    DB     DB
 SG               
 TD               
 RD               
DTR              
DSR               
DCD               
RTS               
CTS               
 RI              

Now to address your problem at hand  When you connect a PC to a PC a DTE
to a DTE there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS
signal definitions don't work out quite right  There is no DCE to assert
the CTS DSR DCD or RI  So the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all  and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well  If
this is done you simply make a null modem a cable that passes through SG
and crosses TD and RD ie pin  of one end connects to pin  at the other
end etc  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready  It would have to just
send the data and hope it got through  Therefore a better null modem would
include the DTRDSR pair crossed  A particular point a confusion is in the
software area  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft
ware will use them  If you are using the builtin BIOS to control the
serial port then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used  But if you have a comm package such as Brooklyn Bridge or Lap
Link or Telix then those packages dictate the cabling requirements  The
only thing you can guess reliably is the SG TD and RD  The DTRDSR is also
fairly common  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here  And
that is flow control  In the RS scenerio the DCE's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible overrun the
DTE  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted the
DCE will send data  without requesting permission first  Note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow the DTE must request permission by
asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can
send  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio the question is do you need flow
control  The answser is usually  But how  For nonbinary communications
one common technique is XON  XOFF which is implemented in software  no
wires are dedicated to flow control the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF
commands  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control but the problem is that you can't send binary data because
your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals  A work around is to have the software insert and extract escape
codes but the hardware flow control is prefered  The problem with hard
ware flow control is that there is no standard  There are lots of ways to
do it and I bet they have all been tried  One cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the RTSCTS for one direction  But beyond that anything is fair
game  Again you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements
But I bet you'll find that one cable if wired properly could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage  By the way
I am familiar with one package that uses RTSCTS and DTRDSR for flow control
the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve the CTS is the
clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve  This does not mean a
differnt cable  it is just software  The clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS
signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support
ing it in software  For these cases you will find cables that short the
RTS to the CTS at the same end or perhaps the DTR to the CTS  Other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you don't have or don't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires  Specifically I am talking about the DSR  Shorting
the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose  One more
gotcha signal is the DCD  Some software including the PC BIOS expects to
see the DCD before it will work  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the
DTR  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end but
the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD  And
of course the DTRDSR are crossed as are the TDRD and of course the SG must
pass through  This null modem works with most software  The flow control
if any can use the RTSDCD with the DTRDSR  If your comm package does not
specify the cable required for PC to PC connection then I suggest you use
this one

    TD    RD
    RD    TD
    DTR  DSR
    DSR  DTR
    DCD  RTS
  RTS  DCD 
  CTS        CTS

 Yes  Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two
 disks at once  Duplexing which is the preferred way of mirroring uses
 two controller cards and two disk drives  Duplexing requires a special
 card and two identical disk drives in most cases  Duplexing can
 sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drivescontrollers as long
 as the sizes are the same

 WM So how is the Novell Server A normally configured

 The configuration is completely up to the user

 WM  Can I install SFT Netware  Level II Va as Level I or is this
 WM what is causing my serialization error

 If you only have one disk then you can't use Level II SFT  However the
 OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it and if this disk is for a different
 version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error  Make sure
 that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the
 NetWare installation set

 WM  Is the Novell Server A normally equipped with two hard drives
 WM one of which has failed

 Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I or one volume
 mirrored using SFT II  Impossible to tell with the network being down

 WM  Would this mean I can not install the network software because it
 WM will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive

 Try disconnecting the failed drive using a standard disk controller and
 installing the software as one volume under SFT I  If the software will
 install and if the one disk is functional then it should be able to work
 in this configuration

 WM  What else can cause a serialization error

 See the comment concerning the serial number on the OSOBJ installation
 floppy

 WM  What happens if the keycard fails

 What is the keycard attached to

 On    John Bongiovanni had the unmitigated gall to say this

 Suddenly the date no longer rolls over  The time is reasonably accurate
 allways but we have to change the date by hand every morning  This involves
 exiting the menu system to get to DOS
 
 JB Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance something like
 JB a  clock has to make a Get Date system call Apparently the clock
 JB hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this date advance
 JB automatically The Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag
 JB has been set and then then advances the date

When a program uses a DOS call to get the system it resets the flag that
tells the BIOS that it has passed midnight  It then uses this flag to
increment the date  If the menu does a call to the system to get the time
before midnight before the BIOS sees the midnight flag then BIOS will not
know that the day passed and the date will not get updated

I might have some DOS's and BIOS's mixed up darned cold messed up my
brains but this has been a well documented problem for years  I don't know
of a workaround  Hope this helps

 LH it did not work  If anyone can help post of email  Thanx

LPT ports don't recognize baud parity etc settings  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port  Try this attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings  Try

CMODE COMN

to set the port parameters  Then use the MODE command to redirect the
printer port LPT like this

CMODE LPTCOM

This should work  Good luck

 On    Michael Shapiro had the unmitigated gall to say this

 MS The DOS system date has a twentyfour hour clock and a rollover bit
 MS When the system crosses midnight the rollover bit is turned on  
 MS Subsequent reads of the time add one  There's no change possible

 MS This information was current up through DOS   I've not checked to
 MS see whether it applies to later versions

Just a small tidbit with the advent of DOS  and later versions MS added
a small feature to the DOS time function  If a program sets the DOS clock
via DOS system services then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value
This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that
errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock

 On    Rx Getter had the unmitigated gall to say this

 RG This may be a dumb question but I need to put a hard drive on my
 RG father's PCXT either MFM RLL or IDE I know how to hook it up but
 RG how do I tell the computer the geometry of the drive On my  you
 RG set it in the BIOS but I doubt that's how it's done on an XT I

Most XT IDE controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
geometry and getting the information to the computer  The controller may
come with software to update its onboard BIOS or may be designed to work
with a particular drive  Seagate drives usually have special controllers
for use on XT's and these are tailored to the drive

Also you cannot lowlevel format an IDE drive  The lowlevel format is
stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called servos not
like the electronic use of the term that need a higher recording bias than
the drive's recording heads can generate  Don't try to lowlevel format an
IDE drive

 Ik I'm in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix  got a new hard
 Ik disk discovered my BIOS doesn't have a type  and I would like
 Ik know where I can purchase one of these things

Call Phoenix  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson  to an IDE drive

Also if you are installing an IDE drive and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume try using it  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically in
most cases

WARNING  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive  A smaller setting will not harm the drive but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over  Drive damage will not
result but headaches will

 JCL do know it's because the noise in the line I can actually hear it 
 JCL So my question is will an error correction protocol help to eliminate
 JCL this garbage my modem doesn't have any of these on hardware can a
 JCL software implemented protocol do the trick

There is a software version of MNP available from MTEZ and it will often
connect with other modems that are MNP compatible but if the modem that you
are connecting to doesn't support MNP then it won't help  Error correcting
modems will eliminate line noise but only id there are error correcting
modems on both ends of the conncetion  The added soeed is much worth the
price of error correcting modems   baud Vbis modems are very
reasonable and they are only about  slower than the more expensive

 TK accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular
 TK box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up rather than getting
 TK the Nonsystem diskette message the machine hangs and the CMOS
 TK gets overwritten luckily Gateway sends a print of the standard

Just a wild thought here but how about this there is a small boot program
on every formatted diskette whether or not it contains system files  It is
this small program that prints the NonSystem Disk error not DOS  If
this program tries to transfer control to a BIOS location that is
nonstandard on the Gateway then it could clear the BIOS

I don't think that the BIOS is overwritten there is usually a small routine
to clear the CMOS area in case an invalid configuration prevents the
machine from booting  I think that the boot code on the Fuji disks may
inadvertantly call this routine

Just a thought

Is it possible to put more than  controller in a PC  By this I mean of 
different types  ie  RLL and MFM  If so how do you access the drives
in the CMOS setup  Do they just show up to be configured or do you 
have to do low level writes to the controller  

As an example put  RLL controller with  drives in a machine  Put
a MFM controller and  more drives connected to it  I now have 
drives with  controllers of different types  Also can you 
put  controllers of the same type into a PC and again how do you access 
them  

I was asked this question and never tried to do it so if anyone has
done this and can supply me with info I would very pleased

Thanx in advance for any info

Hi

I need some advice opinions regarding which PC would best suit my needs
I want to use this proposed beast for basically four things  

     	Editing documents using WordPerfect  under dos

     	Creating graphsanalyzing data using Sigmaplot V under dos

     	Editingplaying with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under 
	Windows   these images can be large say k x k bitspixel

     	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqViewX  and Sun PCNFS 
	talking to our network of Sparcstation's  this is where a lot of
	the imagesdata come from and is the most demanding of these tasks

I've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup
and decided that a nice system priceperformance would be

	DX k cache ISA VLB meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  meg ram local bus
	 monitor x NI
	Com Etherlink III bit
	Maxtor MB IDE hard drive

However the parts don't fit  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
together only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at MHz  surprise
surprise  Actually after reading this group I'm surprised that they even
have a MHz local bus running

I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
DX with ISA and VLB  or   a DX with EISA and no VLB and thus
the nonlocal bus version of the ATI card  Which is better keeping in mind
that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks  

Any help would be greatly appreciated  I need to decide quickly so any 
speedy help would be appreciated even more



BTW We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following 
configuration

	DX k cache ISA  meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra  meg ram
	 monitor x NI
	SMC Ethercard  bit
	Maxtor MB IDE hard drive

We're quite happy with the ATI card  very fast ONCE the data gets to it
Slow repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or
been uncovered  

There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqViewX  Its sluggish
running the local window manager  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take
a long time even when the images fit entirely in ram

There's not enough memory in the system  DesqViewX and a  meg SmartDrive
don't leave much room for other apps  Photostyler will page to disk with
medium size images

I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates  This
machine sustains only ksec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain ksec 
on the same network  Going to the  bit version of the SMC card increases
transfer rates to ksec  still very slow especially when moving large 
images  Is there such a thing as a localbus ethernet card coming  Will it
make a difference  I'm hoping so and leaning towards the DX choice 
above for that reason

Also are there DX's on the horizon  What about DX's  DX's 

Any information is greatly appreciated

What are peoples opinions on the above make of hard drives I seem to have 
found a really good bargain on a meg drive but I thought I'd check if
anyone had any comments to say on this make

Also I'm a bit of a novice with PC's but an experienced computer user when
connecting and fitting this drive into one of my spare   bays what extras
will I need a cable for starters I guess   but what about brackets etc

Also I think I might have to change some jumpers on the drive and my original
Connar meg one I'll be attaching the second drive to a seperate IDE socket
on my controler card What will I need to change 

Yet again many thanks to all that have answered me in the past and to any that

IDE also uses DMA techniques  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA
and most AD boards also use DMA  DMA is no big deal and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI

No  The simple  style IDE controller does not use DMA  The CPU performs
the data transfer with a string move instruction  This requires that the
CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data  Only the smart drive
controllers be they IDE or SCSI can transfer via DMA  These controllers
tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI  To get the DMA benefits
IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage on the controller

 For example when rewinding or formatting a tape the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus  This greatly increases productivity or at least do
something else while backing up your hard drive   Which happens to be
what I am doing while reading this group

You can thank your software for that  If DOS had a few more brains it
could format floppies etc while you were doing something else  The
hardware will support it but DOS at least won't  Again this has   
nothing to do with SCSI

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus your arguement makes no sense this isn't
an IDE issue  The floppys have their own processor on their controller
board which handles all of these commands

The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are
intelligent  They each have their own controller  They depend on the
CPU to do fewer things for them ie IDE drives needing a processor
to transfer their data

Its a long story but I still use IDE on my  except for the CDROM which
thanks to SCSI I can move between both machines  If and when SCSI is
better standardized and supported on the ibmclone machines I plan to
completely get rid of IDE

And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask

Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS type OS do all the miraculous things
with an IDE harddrive that it can with a single SCSI hard drive

The dettachcallback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the 
devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business
Later when the device is done it issues a callback to say that the
data has arrived or the function has completed  Most SCSI cards will
also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU therefore
allowing it to continue working uninterupted  IDE supports no such concept
as dettachcallback  

Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system

This may be a dumb question but I need to put a hard drive on my father's
PCXT either MFM RLL or IDE I know how to hook it up but how do I tell
the computer the geometry of the drive On my  you set it in the BIOS but
I doubt that's how it's done on an XT I thought it might be software with
the controller card but the IDE card for XT's that I saw didn't come with
any Also how do I low level format it once it's on the computer Assuming
a drive which needs formatting

Since there is no BIOS support for ST interface hard disks in an XT
that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the MFMRLL hard disk
controller Usually the controller has a ROMbased low level format
program a common jump address is C  you can type GC from
debug to see and a small table of drive geometries it knows about
Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card sometimes you
can enter them manually in the LLF menu Failing that you must use a
thirdparty HD prep program like SpeedStor Disk Manager or the like

IDE drives come formatted already and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself concerns about geometry are irrelevant Plug
it in and go to FDISK

Hello All

I recently acquired a CDROM drive a Mitsumi mfg Feb   Hey it
was free        I'm quite pleased with the performance but it seems
to crash a lot when I use PLAYCDEXE that came with it a DESQview  
Thoughts  This mainly happens when my BBS is running in the background and
I load the program up If I load the program it doesn't crash and I start
the disk stop the program and start the BBS its OK but otherwise I have
big problems IE they can only be solved with a cold boot

If anybody can mail me to help me I would be eternally grateful 
unfortunately my feed to this group is a little unreliable so I would appreciate
 if you could mail but by all means post it too because I'm sure somebody else 
 would like to know

Cheers
Wes

   Hi
       I am buying a Quantum LPSAT  MB hardisk and is deciding a
       HDDFDD controller Is bit VLbus HDDFDD controller faster 
       than  bit IDE HDDFDD controller card

No VLbus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE  The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus and if
you hook it to VLbus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two
meaning ISA speed

It's not true  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its IDE bus signal timing
doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing  My VLIDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from MBsec up to MB
sec the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 
milion bytesec and  milion bytesec respectively   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of MBsec on the ISA bus

       I hear that
       the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller

On the other hand I wouldn't expect it to be slower

In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their  or  class machine
without spending a lot of money I looked into replacing the processor
on those machines and here are the facts as I understand them

If you have a PS Model  or Model  you can replace the i chip with
either  a Cyrix DLC chip for  which will increase your processing
power by about  for normal fuctions and not at all for math functions
This chip will only run at your original clock speed ie if you have a MHz
machine the Cyrix DLC will run at MHz
note Windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if
you are running Windows
Or  you can get a Kingston NOW platform for  with a MHz iSX
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about  if you
were running at MHz originally But again it will not increase the speed
of your math fuctions  I think that it will continue to run at MHz even
if your original processor runs at a slower speed
There is also  the Kingston NOW platform for  with a MHz iDX
on it  This might speed up your math functions as well but I am not sure

If you have a PS Model  B or other PS machine with either an iSX
or a nonclock doubling iDX ie it runs at either  or MHz in it
then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip which is really an iDX chip and
replace your chip with it  You should get about  better preformance for
both normal and math functions  The  Mhz version of the Overdrive chip
costs  and the MHz version costs   The replacement for the
MHz SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math
coprocessor which the SX does not have  Note that the speed ratings on the
Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run  If you have a
MHz SX then the Overdrive chip will run at MHz ie MHz externally
and MHz internally  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is
rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance

You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that
advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week  You might want to shop
around as prices do vary  If you need a namephone number for a source for
a particular chip email me and I will respond with a couple of sources

I have a sx computer with a  Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler  
built into the motherboard I want to add a SCSI drive a quantum prodrive  
F  MG formatted I have no documentation at all and I need your  
help

As I understand it here is the process of adding such a drive  Could you  
please tell me if I'm right

 Buy a SCSI contoler  Which one I know Adaptec is good but they are  
kind of expensive  Are there any good boards in the  region I want  
it to be compatible with OS and Unix if possible  Also I have seen on  
the net that there are SCSI and SCSI drives Is this true Does the  
adapter need to be the same as the drive What type of drive is the  
quantum

 connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable
Do i have to worry about the power supply I think I have  watts and  
all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive

 Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive  What type  
of drive is this I don't have the numbers for this drive

 Format and create partitions on the drive Do I use format or fdisk I  
think that IDE drives can't be lowlevel formatted Is it the same with  
SCSI How exactly does fdisk work I have a reduced msdos  manual  
clone obliges and there is no mention of fdisk  Ideally I would want  
the drive partitioned in to two partitions D and E how do I do this

Well that seems to be all Is there anythiing I'm forgetting 
Any help is really appreciated I'm lost

Does anybody out there have or used to have an HD controller from
Perstor System Inc which is out of business I believe  My friend
received an old PC which happens to have such a controller and I am
having a hard time trying to add another HD to the card


I believe the controller is supposed to control MFM drives as RLL
drives 


Here the model info on the card but any other similar model will
probably do

Rationale

The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for
the discussion relating to their needs At the moment the main fora
for such discussion are in altcdrom and compmultimedia neither
of which have publishing as their focus Some lists serve the
general cdrom community with focuses on library government and
network usage and until several weeks ago none were devoted 
to publishing CDPub has just been setup In any case a list is not
and ought not be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups
 
The reason for the division into three groups is a natural
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics
and between the two main focal points of software ie fulltext
and multimedia publishing Topics such as CDROM XA CDI CDR 
Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well 
Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly
hardware or software related such as books copyright issues and
other legal matters packaging distribution could be included in
the purvue of comppublishcdromsoftware as would any other
nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom
publishing in any format and is appropriate to the Internet
 
The main focus of comppublishcdromsoftware would be topics such as
index and retrieval software premastering software cdrom
simulation software hypertext sgml scanning and imaging
software data capture software data clean up compression
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms
 
The main focus of comppublishcdrommultimedia would be software that
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process  audio and
video
 
The main focus of comppublishcdromhardware would be hardware that
relates to cdrom publishing as well as hardware for data capture
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware as well as
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that
the intended enduser will utilize the hardware that will
eventually play the published cdrom including networks for cdrom
 
Notes

These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like
Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general
topics should be directed to other fora Questions about cdroms
mounted on LANs should be directed to bitlistservcdromlan

I have a Leading edge sx with  Megs of RAM that are in the forms of  
  meg SIMMS  Each SIMM has two chips on it They are manufactured by  
Samsung and are ns  A salesman told me that the leading edge CPC  
motherboard has the extra parity bit built in and reccomemnded I use MAC  
SIMMS I tried using  Megs pulled out of a Mac SI these are  chip  
SIMMS but I got too many windows protection faults and parity errors I  
guess I should use the same SIMMS as the ones I have but I can't find  
any Most of the places I have called carry only   or  chip SIMMS

So if anybody knows where I can get memory that is good with my computer  
or if you have any suggestions at all please let me know

Any help is truly appreciated

Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal

I am trying to use the xxM mode under unix so i cant just call int hI have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos but I
am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et
Anyway the problem is that in this mode the Horizontal Total Register
dh index is apparently set to x but dh index  the displayed clocks
is set to xEF so x is nonsense A resonable value would be x  so is
there a high bit and if so where is it
Also how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency  and
what would be an appropriate frequency The documentation isn't really very
clear tsengtxt from  vgadoczip from some ftp site about this
My card is a MegaVga Mb card Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios ver  I
think Works nicely under dos and very well under unix linux in all the
nonhicolor modes Great for running Xwindows in up to xxni  if your
monitor will take it only just in my case

Please email the answer as I can't read news very often

Thanks very much

NPJust got a MHz DX system and am considering getting a fan for the

NPHas anyone out there got a CPU fan

I work for a small PC OEM We offer both a personal and professional
system line Our  pro machines always have a CPU cooling fan on DX
and DX units

NPIs there more than  type

There are several manufacturers

NPDo you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan

Sometimes  depends on the specific fan model

NPDo all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines

All the ones I've seen do many come with a 'Y' connector so you don't
have to have a spare connector

NPAnyone had any trouble with CPU fans

None

NPDoes anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of
money

Touch a DX chip after its been running a few minutes  you won't
feel the fan is a waste

NPHow are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese

Depends on the model Many use clips  make sure you use heat sink
grease or heat transfering tape or you will have wasted your money

NPRoughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to
without an advert I've read claims F vs F

Tough to tell  I do know the chip sheds a lot of heat

Serial cables

There are only three output signals TD DTR and RTS
There are five inputs signals RD DSR DCD CTS and RI

There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software
The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and
CTS before sending  When a BIOS recieve call is made it asserts DTR and
waits for DSR to become true times out after a while and returns with an
error if DSR never becomes true  It requires CTS to be true for sending
AND recieving  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it
with their own protocol  The key is that each comm package could very
well have different requirements

My favorite cable works in many cases short RTS to CTS at each end but
also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end  TD runs through to RD
and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through
to SG

I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it
with a comm package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD
The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS

works very well under OS so I know that the drive is not faulty
In my configsys I have aspidossys aspidisksys aspicdsys  In my 
autoexecbat I have MSCDEX which came with DOS   MSCDEX seems to find
and install the drive as drive F but when I switch to that drive and try a
dir I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something
like that  The CDROM is locked too and the adaptec utilities don't seem to
recognize that I have a CDROM at that point


The current Adaptec drivers do not support the Toshiba   you should
get the Corel SCSI drivers which do support it

This is the method that I used and it works well

Corel's phone number is

 I want to use this proposed beast for basically four things  

      	Editing documents using WordPerfect  under dos

      	Creating graphsanalyzing data using Sigmaplot V under dos

      	Editingplaying with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under 
 	Windows   these images can be large say k x k bitspixel

      	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqViewX  and Sun PCNFS 
 	talking to our network of Sparcstation's  this is where a lot of
 	the imagesdata come from and is the most demanding of these tasks

 I've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup
 and decided that a nice system priceperformance would be

 	DX k cache ISA VLB meg ram
 	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  meg ram local bus
 	 monitor x NI
 	Com Etherlink III bit
 	Maxtor MB IDE hard drive

 However the parts don't fit  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
 together only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at MHz  surprise
 surprise  Actually after reading this group I'm surprised that they even
 have a MHz local bus running

 I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
 DX with ISA and VLB  or   a DX with EISA and no VLB and thus
 the nonlocal bus version of the ATI card  Which is better keeping in mind
 that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks  

Having in mind the size of the images my opinion is to go with VLB
It has much more bandwith that EISA which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card I have not made measures so someone else may
share experience on that

Also the DX is faster in the operations that run off internal
cache slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory
So my advice is the VLB

 We're quite happy with the ATI card  very fast ONCE the data gets to it
 Slow repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or
 been uncovered  

 There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqViewX  Its sluggish
 running the local window manager  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take
 a long time even when the images fit entirely in ram

 There's not enough memory in the system  DesqViewX and a  meg SmartDrive
 don't leave much room for other apps  Photostyler will page to disk with
 medium size images

Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache No need to have
paging and cache both Well you might argue that the paging is
cached My belief no measurements is that apps left with more
memory will manage it better than smartdrvexesys

 I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates  This
 machine sustains only ksec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain ksec 
 on the same network  Going to the  bit version of the SMC card increases
 transfer rates to ksec  still very slow especially when moving large 
 images  Is there such a thing as a localbus ethernet card coming  Will it
 make a difference  I'm hoping so and leaning towards the DX choice 
 above for that reason

The bandwidth theoretical of ISA is over MBs which is far from
MBs I tried my ISA IDE hard drive Maxtor MB and got the
same results  MBs  regardless of the ISA bus speed
MHz So I guess that just the carddrivers combination is
lousy

 Also are there DX's on the horizon  What about DX's  DX's 

The rumors are that DX if any is the most likely chip to come
out But note that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards so you'll have to upgrade the MB

 Any information is greatly appreciated

Just some view not much figures

 So when you've got multitasking you want to increase performance by
 increasing the amount of overlapping you do
 
 One way is with DMA or bus mastering  Either of these make it
 possible for IO devices to move their data into and out of memory
 without interrupting the CPU  The alternative is for the CPU to move
 the data  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
 bus mastering
  
 How do you do busmastering on the ISA bus

As an earlier post noted  through DMA

 IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface
 created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data
 bytes with no DMA

 If we're talking ISA AT bus here then you can only have  DMA channel
 active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device
 So even though you can have at least  devices on a SCSI bus explain how
 all  of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
 to the ISAAT bus at the same time

Any one time means IMHO a single byte xfer If I have four sources of
DMA requests ready the DMA would service the one after the other If
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISADMA
bandwidth this will work

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA
controller

Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio Think very carefully
Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems you may want
to trade elsewhere

Despite the fact that they answer the phone Hi I'm whoever and we're
having a GREAT Day they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return
a modem that didn't work as I expected it to

The details

I ordered one of their house brand Infotel DF internal FAX modems
In reality it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over
the name Given the poor reports on the net about this modem I would not
have ordered it had I known this in advance

It arrived on time The documentation stated that it would work and was
preconfigured as COM providing that COM was not in use at the same time

For several reasons I have a serial card configured for COMCOM At the
time I installed the modem nothing was connected to COM

Although the modem appeared to work during every connection at  or
 it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone After
spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support they suggested
disabling the COM port

This appeared to solve the disconnect problem but was an unacceptable long
term solution I had to have COM and  available even though they both
would not be in use at the same time as the modem

I called back  minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail 
hell listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products I 
was then promptly disconnected Apparently it was quiting time and they 
didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line

I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA
number She promptly switched me to a Tech Support rep that implied that
it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA
number He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings a solution I
was not happy with The modem should work as originally configured

Conclusion

I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system but it clearly does
not work in a multi port system like mine Since my time is worth more 
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem I gave it to a local
charitable organization with a description of my problem and ordered
a Practical Peripherals MT from PC Connection

For  more I have a solid external modem built by a company I know 
will support their users and sold by a company based on personal
experience will treat me right if there is a problem I should have
known better

other than the noise from the Poersupply it ran pretty good
as for cooling problems I bought a  inch fan and  turned
it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard

I did finally get a case though and I am still running the parts
with no ill effects

I also had no kids to spill things on the MB I had no cat leaving
hair on the MB etc etc on and on

the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the MB cool

 It's an interesting idea but the worstcase data patterns developed to
 test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect
 common faults in memory chips
 
I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago
getting parity error  system halted error message in windows
I ran QAPLUS Check It Diagnose as well as several shareware
memory checkers I had a total of  meg SIMM in my system
these store bought shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
without errors or found an error at some address that I couldn't
place on a memory chip Out of exahperation I came up with
the now deleted steps to find bad memory chips I found 
moral  never buy memory stamped not for sensitive or critical 
applications on the back
        anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
combinations of  of the  meg chips and creating a RAM drive to
test on Although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems
in windows I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me and the commercial
shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or
pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it is

ps man my typing stinks today and I don't feel like futzing around with

In a previous article cssdaemaccsmcmasterca Holly       KS says

What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier vbis external and the
Sportster  external I see that the price of a Sportster has dramatically
dropped to below  but the price of the Courier remains above 

Anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a Courier

the Courier is their topoftheline product thus the higher price  I've
never taken a real look at the Sportster line only Couriers but from what
I've gathered it's basically more of an entrylevel modem  probably
doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does  I'm not sure
if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the more recent Courier
modems are so upgrades in the future may be an issue

again take all of the above with a grain of saltI've never evaluated
the Sportster so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard  if you
want a real answer post the question in compdcommodems and you'll find
people who HAVE worked with the Sportster

personally though if I were going to look at the Courier modems I'd
buy the Dual Standardthen I'd get both HST and Vbis  in fact this
is exactly what I did    I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right
now

and now to correct a few VERY incorrect statements  folks if you want
to get reliable answers to modem andor UART questions post them to
compdcommodems  if you post in other groups you never know what you'll
get in the way of an answer you may very well get a good answeror you
may get something like the one below  at least in cdm if someone posts
complete and utter bs you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them to
avoid spreading faulty info

The Sportster at  has v error control and v bis data compression

just as it does at lower speeds too  there is absolutely nothing in
either CCITT Recommendation V or Vbis that says that they can only
operate on modems that are running Vbis  Vbis of course is
currently only STANDARDIZED for operation on top of V in its primary
mode of operation LAPM but that's about as far as that goes

and just in case there's some confusion on this VVbis are also
supported by the Courier line unless you have a really ancient one

The difference
with the Courier is that it can run at  and only in the HST mode 

take a second look at the original question

In a previous article cssdaemaccsmcmasterca Holly       KS says
What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier vbis external
                                                 
see the Vbis up there  the question was not about the Courier HST
modem or about the Courier Dual Standardit was about the Courier
Vbis modem  the modem in question does not support HST period  it
therefore does not support the  kb HST

also not all Courier HST  Courier Dual Standard modems support the  kb
version of HST  my Dual Standard only supports HST at  kb  there are
even older models that only run HST at  kb

This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of
the same type unit to achieve this speed

HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme  but we're not talking about
HST we're talking about Vbis  Vbis is most definitely NOT a
proprietary modulation scheme

The Sportster will do
asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous  The HST is one way
only

I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some
way

first off V and Vbis are both synchronous and asynchronous  this is
part of the CCITT Recommendation ie part of the standard  it isn't a
feature unique to the Sportster I just looked at the appropriate chapter
in the Courier DS manual

second HST is not one way only''  more correctly put it is an
asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesn't work at the same speed
in both directions  HST operates at      in one direction
and has a lowspeed backchannel in the other direction  the highspeed
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow  this is fine if
you're logged on to say a BBS and type one letter and get screens of
info back transfer files not using bimodem etc  there is of course
a penalty for turnaround time when the highspeed channel needs to reverse
directions

V and Vbis are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full
data rate in both directions at the same time

third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with
symmetrical vs asymmetricalthey are two completely different topics

The HST's will be upgradeable to the vfast spec when it is available

again more correctly put SOME of the Courier line will be upgradeable
to whatever Vfast'' is called when it's complete  if you have the large
footprint Courier modems like I do you're SOL  there was an
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which
could eventually be upgraded to support Vfast but the cost of the two
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem

In a pin serial loopback plug you need to connect the following

That should do it  Note that a lot of these pins are redundant

Hello

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card the older version
with the DIP switches on the back  I have two problems

  I've lost the manual

  I have it in a machine with a network card and
    everything works fine until I run windows when
    the network connection dies

    In case it's important the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet Bit compatable card  It's IO
     address is E and it's RAM base address is
     D  It's also using IRQ 


Shown  press SPACE for more 'q' to quit or 'h' for help
                                                                                
    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out but with no manual I don't
know the Bboard number

    If you can please help me with as many of the following
as possible

a  Send me the Diamond BBS number
b  Email or post the DIP switch settings for the card
    or fax them to me at  
c  Tell me what I'm doing wrong so I can magicly get
    everything working

    Any help at all would be much appreciated

                Thanks in advance

It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix  compatible
DLC and DRU  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service
And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 

The DLC is a  instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a DX
socket Pin Grid Array or PGA  The DLC currently is available in  speeds
the  the  and the   They do not have a coprocessor on board but any
software query will return coproc as present  I guess they emulate the
coproc instructions  Math functions are on the DX level without the
actual coprocessor

The internal cache on the DLC is K  Cyrix literature claims a  hit
rate  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a  performance
boost when it is enabled by software  Overall performance boost from a
DX to a DLC is about   The benchmarks I used were NU SI and
QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones  The performance with the cache enabled
is about on a par with my DX with K external CPU cache which is
around the performance for a SX  The computer runs noticebly faster
and DOS  with Dblspace is not complaining  The company claims OS
compatibility but I didn't test it

The DRU is not a chip as commonly thought  The DRU is actually
a small daughterboard slightly larger than the DX which contains
the logic to manage the clock doubler  This board plugs into the DX
PGA and the DLC or  plugs into this board  I guess the board
doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU and insert wait states when 
access to the rest of the system is required  There are no info available
from Cyrix there  Anyway the DRU is available for DX and DX
only  Double these clock rates and you get the MHZ and the MHZ DLCs
If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU then they need
to put out the MHz DLC first

I also tested a DLC motherboard along with a Cyrix Coprocessor  With K
external cache performance were about  faster than the  but still
significantly  slower than an actual Intel DX

IMHO the DLC is a great low price upgrade for people who can't afford or
can't install a new motherboard  It is definitely worth what I paid for it
but if you need DX performance the DLC won't cut it  I'm not sure
about the DLC but I think even if it matches the performance it won't
beat it in any significant way

The last time I posted info about the DLC people sent quite a bit of mail
asking where I got it  So here is where I got mine

Treasure Chest peripherals they advertise in the Computer Shopper

The DLC kit was 

But

I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier and became a dealer
If you are interested in the chip email me and I can fax or mail you
more info   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use
So I cant post anymore info here  However if there are more questions
regarding the DLC itself I'll post what I can

Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about  weeks
of use mine did
As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically So I mounted the fan
on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink
instead Work just like a charm but the realy biggy to think about
is after the whine goes away on the fan If the fan should stop burn out
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke Thats what
you should be thinking about I have the parts together but have not
had the time to assemble them as yet But you build a thermistor controlled
circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp goes
above the normal operating range c or there abouts Cheep to do if
you use Radio Shack junk under Think about that one for a while

I can get the powerkeylock to work across pins  reset across pins  and
 but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation
The date on the board itself is  opti chips

Subject Diamond Stealth HELP
Date Wed Apr   

Hello

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card the older version
with the DIP switches on the back  I have two problems

  I've lost the manual

  I have it in a machine with a network card and
    everything works fine until I run windows when
    the network connection dies

    In case it's important the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet Bit compatable card  It's IO
     address is E and it's RAM base address is
     D  It's also using IRQ 

REMAINDER DELETED

I don't have my copy of the manual with me right now but I can offer the
following in the interim

     The card uses port addresses xE and xE which are NOT
       configurable  These addresses incidentally were inadvertantly
       omitted from my version of the manual

     I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
       IRQ  for CGA or EGA support

I must say that I have been a customer of Midwest Micro for over 
years now and have been well taken care of on each purchase
I have had many friends that have bought that same modem and THEY
do have some experience with setting up modems so there have been
no problems in  of them that I know of The fact that your time
to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong
WHY you say because I must tell you of the  yes I say  PPI modems
that I have had in the past that I was trying to use on my bbs They
all were junk and were replace  times each to ther point that
I just said forget it and I wanted my money back PPI's teck even
said that they didn't even repair them That they just strip the
parts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem
I think it was more your fault than Midwest Mirco's faulktSam

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't
know if it was sent or not but I have never heard of anyone that
had to return something in the  grace peried that had a problem
at all with Midwest Micro They may of thought that you didn't
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem
But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct
things at all The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because
it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the
instruction and the commands to configure it to hisher system
When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like
you have connected to another EC modem doesn't realy say that
But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on on your modem
I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up
the product Just like I bet someone took home a few extra 
in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PCMagazine award
of the year Not so for the stash  of them that I saw on my test
bench I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems
that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself
I will not even go into the  weeks it took PPI to credit my card
back for the modems after they had received them backno I will
not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co
co from Hayes I'll just say I hope you like your new modem and
maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get
the one that you sent back maybe a good friend of mine I hope

During my attempts to find out how the AT harddisk controller
works I stumbled across IO port h The normal controller
ports are in the FhFh range so what does this port do

The only information I have upto now about this port is that it
is a write only port and the information you have to write in it
is related to the number of heads on the disks

Could somebody shed some light on this and give me the missing info

Hello I've been following discussions on  monitors in 
compsysibmpchardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good
reviews  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products
as well as some others that may fit the bill   

I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like x NI
I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga  or Amiga  wa graphics
board like the Retina andor on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX  Basically
I want a high resolution versital monitor  This monitor need not be large
 if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above  I've been
very happy with a  on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home

I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi
monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty
good to me at least  I haven't seem them brought up in csiph very
often as are Mag and Viewsonic

Ok stuff I'd like to find out  How can I get ahold of Nanao  What are
the products in their line  What are the technical specs  Esp what
scan freq and max resolutions can they handle  What's list and street
cost  if avail from a third party and where can I get ahold of them 
Same info for Sony and Hitatchi

Thank you very much

hello

for  months I've unsuccessfully attempted to get either

various systems diagnostics eg MSD Norton tell me
it's there but anything I hook up to it can't use it

I have two serial ports on the motherboard

if I set my internal FAXmodem for com the utility
programs report a COM

I've checked to make sure all the IRQs and addresses are
correctly as listed in most manuals set

am I missing something very basic

where should I go from here

any help even a point in the right direction would be
most appreciated

You can configure devices for the same IRQ as long as you don't use them
simultaneously under Dos at least Both LPT and SB just sit there until
you tell them to do something You can't configure a SoundBlaster for IRQ
if you got an Ethernet Card which hits that IRQ a thousand times or so per 
second

Lino Montuno

I totally agree with your friend since when the CPU is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
checking for keyboard input for instance  

The exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops where the CPU can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again

Hi

I have the following problem I have to use a computer for special purposes
that doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected No monitor isn't a 
program  but no keyboard
I can't disable the keyboard from BIOS setup in fact there is no setup
I spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply
using a selfmade connector that connects two pins via a resistor
Pity pity I lost contact to the person before getting more detail
So does anyone of you experts can help

 I have a sx computer with a  Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler  
 built into the motherboard I want to add a SCSI drive a quantum prodrive  
 F  MG formatted I have no documentation at all and I need your  
 help
 
 As I understand it here is the process of adding such a drive  Could you  
 please tell me if I'm right
 
  Buy a SCSI contoler  Which one I know Adaptec is good but they are  
 kind of expensive  Are there any good boards in the  region I want  
 it to be compatible with OS and Unix if possible  Also I have seen on  
 the net that there are SCSI and SCSI drives Is this true Does the  
 adapter need to be the same as the drive What type of drive is the  
 quantum


I have tried others but I think that the Adaptec is best value for money


  connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable
 Do i have to worry about the power supply I think I have  watts and  
 all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive


I dont think you can mix the two types of drive unless you have one of the
SCSIIDE cards that is available  You will have to turn your IDE off


  Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive  What type  
 of drive is this I don't have the numbers for this drive


Instructions for drive type are included with the controller  With some it may be
a type  no matter what the disk is  With others it may be a type   I had one
controller that I had to tell the BIOS that no hard disk was installed

 
  Format and create partitions on the drive Do I use format or fdisk I  
 think that IDE drives can't be lowlevel formatted Is it the same with  
 SCSI How exactly does fdisk work I have a reduced msdos  manual  
 clone obliges and there is no mention of fdisk  Ideally I would want  
 the drive partitioned in to two partitions D and E how do I do this


Do not low level format a SCSI unless you have the SCSI low level format program 
First use fdisk to set the partitions then use format


 Well that seems to be all Is there anythiing I'm forgetting 
 Any help is really appreciated I'm lost

Hello
a friend a mine has a commodore sx and we've put in that machine
a second harddisk he now has  MB But the problem is that
the MB harddisk isn't supported in the bios Alas there's no user type
 in the setup At the moment we use it as a MB type but there are
getting bad blocks on the harddisk  Question who knows a solution to this
I've seen a small program for this once in the BYTE but I haven't been able
to find this Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this I used these
programs quite a lot in the XTdays but I don't have these anymore Seagate
used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold
 
Help will be greatly appreciated

I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet  The nameplate does not 
specify a number but since the LJ II followed later one assumes that he 
has a LJ I   His problem is a tax program which requires a  cpi font to 
print the forms properly

This unit came to market in  versions  The plus version supported 
dowloadable fonts  You can guess which one my friend has  the plain not 
the plus  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction 
of cartridges including a  cpi  but none with a  cpi font

Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a  or  cpi font  
Alternatively is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable 
cost

Any suggestions would be welcome

Thanks

 Hi
 
 Does anyone have a source for DX Motherboards  I've
 been calling around the local stores and everyone appears
 to be only stocking the DX or SX motherboards
 
 How difficult is it to modify a DX motherboard to run at
  MHz  Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a
 slower part
 
 Thanks

This is normally the case but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator
as you will screw up your warranty if you start to solder the board

IBM Apple Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC  Processor


The wraps will come off the PowerPC  processor this week as Motorola
Corp IBM and Apple Computer Inc detail the results of their yearlong
effort This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a bit
processor with a bit memory interface much like Intel Corp's
Pentium with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle according to sources familiar with the chip Motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations running at  and  MHz with performance of  and 
SPECint marks respectively sources said Floatingpoint performance
for the volt processors will be even better as their SPECfp
performance will be  and  respectively The  a scaleddown
version of the Power  chip developed by IBM for its RS
workstations will also include a K single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support Motorola's bit multiprocessor  bus
built in The chip which is being designed initially to support the
Micro Channel Architecture is bus independent so vendors could develop
PowerPC based systems using a number of different architectures
including ISA EISA or Sun Microsystems Inc's Sbus design one source
noted

According to sources familiar with the development effort Motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive
architecture despite a complex design made up of more than  million
transistors using a micron technology Initial chips are expected to
be priced from  to   only slightly higher than Intel Corp's
 processors  but could be sold profitably for less than  one
source said

are we talking about a SCSI device eg HD on a SCSI Controller
or          
are we talking about a SCSI Controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a SCSI controller board
we are talking about a SCSI device eg HD on a SCSI Controller

Here is a rewrite of my Mac  Info sheet SCSI section
SCSI only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM
 Allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner Nubus card 
 expansion Mac Plus only some monitors and CDROM  Normal asynchronous
 SCSI is  Mhz  fast synchronous SCSI is  Mhz  Difference between these
 modes is mainly in the software drivers
 Main problem  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end 
 Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM 
SCSI  bit  devices per SCSI controller  asynchronous MBs ave
 and synchronous MBs max transfers  bit SCSI is often mistaken for
 a fast version of SCSI see SCSI for details
SCSI fully SCSI compliant SCSI mode   devices per SCSI controller
 bit SCSI is implimented as a very fast SCSI since it can run using
 SCSI hardware and software drivers which limits it to  devices which
 results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI  bit
 and bit SCSI require different ports electronics and SCSI software
 drivers from SCSI Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI
 interfaces  bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode hence term
 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are MBs with MBs burst bit
 MBs with MBs burst bit and MBs with MBs burst
 bit

bit SCSI is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI 
that I know of that can pump SCSI speeds through SCSI devices and software
controlers  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds
for SCSI at MBs maximum throughput for PCs  Since bit SCSI does NOT
NEED all the hardware including electonics and software of bit and bit
SCSI it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI interfaces  Just pop out the SCSI
electornics and pop in bit SCSI electronics  Some people consider
bit where SCSI REALLY starts I USED to be one of them but
MBs average though put with a theoretical burst of MBs is NOT SCSI
but is bit SCSI
Rule of thumb if it is SCSIn and OVER MBs then it is SOME type of SCSI

bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI electronics which further reduces its cost
compared to  and bit SCSI

 Just got a MHz DX system and am considering getting a fan for the
 CPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a
 fairly good idea long ago when I did some electronics training I read
 somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctionsgates etc
 slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature hence a hot
 chip goes offspec sooner
 
 Has anyone out there got a CPU fan
 Is there more than  type
 Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan
 Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines
 Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans
 Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of money
 How are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese
 Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to without
   an advert I've read claims F vs F
 
 Any info appreciated

longer appears  It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
of  degrees Fahrenheit  According to the maker's MS Tech

I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi
monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty
good to me at least  I haven't seem them brought up in csiph very
often as are Mag and Viewsonic

Give the new Viewsonic  a good look  I have seen it side by side with
an old Viewsonic  a MAG  a Nanao  not the Trinitron one and
a Sony OEM  which does have a Trinitron tube  The new Viewsonic
beat all of them easily in terms of picture quality and I think it is
far superior to the  Sun that I am staring at now  The place asks
 for it I would have bought it if I had not just bought a 
Nanao Fiw a week earlier

HELP  I am trying to view JPG files with my SX MHz machine
  I have a STBPOWERGRAPH graphics card with  X  by  colors
with Meg RAM on it

I have tried CVIEW with windows EXTREMELY SLOW and DVPEG
DVPEG doesn't work  Even if I pick a lot of the modes that are
supported by POWERGRAPH so it says in the manual it doesn't work
when I try to view a picture it only buzzes

Anyone out there that can help me give me suggestions

I would really appreciate it

Thanks

 There is a software version of MNP available from MTEZ and it will often
 connect with other modems that are MNP compatible but if the modem that you

There's also a program called ODYSSEY MODEM directory on the Simtel
archives that emulates MNP  and  others too I think but these were
what I was interested in  I was getting a lot of garbage when I called
one number and MNP  cleared it up completely on my ordinary  modem
Fortunately the remote end had an MNP modem

I tried MNP  too but it seemed to lock up the computer  Your mileage

 I am no expert on this  But I am pretty sure there is no way to recover this  IDE drive has mapping information written directly on drives  When you  low level format it the information itself is gone as well I don't think you can get it back unless  you send it back to Western Digital and ask them to refurbish it for you
 
 Jim

Well I have a different story to recount  I attempted to lowlevel format a
WD MB disk about a year ago  When I understood my error I contacted WD
They told me that I hadn't hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and
FORMATS on it  It was fine  Also I understand that Western Digital's BBS
may have some lowlevel formatting routines specifically available for IDE
drives  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop

 I dont think you can mix the two types of drive unless you have one of

Don't even get hyped up  They are still accepting submissions from the

You don't seem to realize that while vbis was just an extension of
v which took years to pass implement and finally sell at a reasonable
price vfast requires all new technology not just faster DSP chips etc
to achieve its performance

Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly

FOR SALE

ATT Dataport Internal K FaxModem

The modem is an internal ATEISA bit card just a little longer
than a halfcard  It has vbis for Kbps data   bps fax
v vbis and MNP for errorcorrection and data compression so
you can get errorfree links up to  bps on a conventional phone
line  They will fall back to any speed down to bps and even
disable compression and errorcorrection if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems

It has a  buffered UART for better compatibility with
multitasking operating systems Windows OS Unix etc

They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface OLI
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible

These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support and the call is free too from ATT

They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the
NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows
application just by printing  The Windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics etc  The DOS version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts I believe that there are  or so
as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts

I'm asking  for this modem plus Utah tax  This is at or
below the prices of any other reputable manufacturer of an
equivalent modem including Zoom US Robotics etc  And it is
backed by a company that will never go away

This price will include delivery if you live within  miles of
downtown SLC  I can also arrange shipping or you can stop by my home
to pick it up  If you're concerned about installing an internal
modem let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation

If you're interested please let me know  This is an excellent modem
at an excellent price they normally list for  and retail for
about   I installed one of these last week and it is very nice

If you have questions about this ATT has an info number at 
  or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them

The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week

Thanks  
Pete

 Have anybody succeded in converting a atari monomchrome monitor into a
 mono VGA monitor If so please let me know exactly how you did and what
 graphics card you used

 I wish I could help  I posted a similar question about two weeks ago
 I got no response at all  I've asked locally at my friendly Atari store
 I was told that it should be possible but that they had no idea how
 it might be done  Nor did they particularly care to investigate

OK here's my results so far

 You have to define the monitor as LCD  it doesn't really support
   Analogue video input It works but isn't very linear

 The incoming sync pulses need inverting This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter
   If you don't know how to do it don't even contemplate it 

 It'll only work in standard VGA mode

OK having said that I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge and doesn't care about the polarity outputting
the ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires

There are  reasons for doing this

 VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
   in  herc emulation is  while MVGA is  for example

 It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM Currently I have  Yes  monitors sitting on my desk
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paperwhite VGA
   will cut things down to  If I forget about Atari colour
   I can get down to 

Ultimately the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor
but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else so it'll have to wait

 Simple The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge

   something small simple and inexpensive like a  There are only about
    people in the group so it is not a huge network

D and swap Can I tell CMOS to make it E So that if I Stack it I
will have C D E and F

I believe that any VLEISAISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset

HINT EISA DMA has the  mb ram addressing limitation of ISA  For this
reason I would pass  I own one of these HAWK VLEISAISA and am look
ing to replace it for exactly this reason
Please doublecheck me on this  In other words call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true bit EISA
DMA
Other than this limitation the motherboard works quite well I am using
mine with DOS  Windows  and UNIX SR  Also with Adaptec a
EISA SCSI host adapter
Gary Korenek   koreneknmticom


You are correct  The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says
that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks
 Brian J Schaufenbuel

I don't see this as a problem with the chipset a mistake I see this
as something that was designedin intentionally

So it would seem that to enhance the design from  to bit EISA DMA
would require an update to the chipset  An update to the chipset may 
begat an update to the motherboard board design

What I'm saing is  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
off as a simple fix  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT 
along with a possible motherboard layout update  This is not simple
If I were you I would be cautious about this

You might look into the Advanced Integration Research AIR VLEISA
motherboard  All slots are EISAISA capable   or  of the slots are
VLbus capable  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'
bit EISA DMA I called them  PentiumP  capable  Less expensive
than equivalent AMI or Micronics VLEISA board

Look in Computer Shopper April '  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother
board  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it  I'm
attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the
AIR board

Model number of AIR board with DX is BEI  You can call
Motherboard Warehouse for example for a price  Phone 's included

I downloaded these files a couple of days ago and they appeared to be
incompatible with this particular card None of the SVGA drivers worked
They're probably for the newer  and  series

Hello
    I'm trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts which occur every 
seconds or  times a second to time people's response times in a
psychology experiment and the response times are on the order of 
seconds Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting
ticks Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently I'm trying to do
this in DOS  on a  and it would be nice if this could also work
on our old  machines running DOS  I know I know I don't like
them any more than you do but this is by no means a requirement just a
possibility 
    So basically any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the
related inrterruots would be appreciated as well as any information on
alternate ways of improving accuracy Email is preferred as I'm
planning on posting this to a few boards and I don't read all of them
Thanks

  your problem   

 Is this true I was under the impression that people on the net had both  
 SCSI and IDE working together

     No it's not true  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together but
there are restrictions at least with the Adaptec 

 You MUST boot from the IDE drive  There is no way to boot from the
  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives

 You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS I'm not sure about this though
  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI
  drive  Hmm  I know that you have to disable something related to
  the SCSI BIOS but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself

     Back in February someone asked about IDE and SCSI this question
gets asked again and again  At the end of this message I've included
an edited copy of my reply  You might find it interesting

DISCLAIMER this message is the author's personal opinion and does not
constitute the support opinion or policy of HewlettPackard or of the
little green men that have been following him all day


   Is it worth it to get SCSI over IDE   Will there be a noticable
     decrease in access timeincrease in Xfer rate

     For MSDOS applications ISAbased SCSI and IDE controllers
generally have comparable throughput  You might get slightly higher
throughput with a SCSI disk but you'll also pay more for the disk
 and up in some cases  You'll also pay much much more for a
good SCSI controller

     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're
used with a good multitasking operating system like a PC Unix
Unfortunately neither MSDOS nor Windows  is a good multitasking
operating system  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is
mostly wasted with these which leaves the advantage of being able to
connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage
However note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices

     If you're only going to be using MSDOS stick with IDE  It's
cheaper and you'll have less headaches

   Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my
     harddrive bernoulli box CDrom Tape Drive etc

 Note the following is true for MSDOSWindows only  Who knows what
  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix 

     No  Generally you have to find drivers for each SCSI device
which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the betterhigh
performance SCSI controllers  These are typically busmastering SCSI
controllers that cost around  street prices and up and
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
namebrand SCSI devices either come with the card or can be purchased
for under  list price  Examples of such driver kits are

 Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit list   This works only with Adaptec SCSI
  controllers

 CorelSCSI from the same people who make CorelDRAW list  
  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card
  that has an ASPI driver like the Adaptec

     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS  supports a number of SCSI tape
drives the documentation lists  tape drives  Unfortunately it
works only with Adaptec controllers

   Are there likely to be other problemsincompatibilities with a
     SCSI controller and  sound cardsvideo acceleratorsand similar
     equipment

     Yes you will run into problems if you're using a
highperformance busmastering SCSI controller  This doesn't sound
right doesn't it  It's true though  With one of these controllers
you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
cards floppycontrollerbased tape drives like the CMS Jumbo  and
Windows   I know  I've been to hll and back getting my SCSI
controller to work with various hardwaresoftware thank God for tape
backups  If you want a copy of my Adaptec  hints and tips file
send email

     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
the PC eg no standards  However adding a busmastering SCSI card
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible

     SCSI holds a lot of promise but you can run into a lot of PC
compatibility problems  If you're planning on using only MSDOSWindows
 stick with IDE  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix you'll
have to make some hard decisions a good SCSI controller and more than
one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance at the
possible cost of MSDOS compatibility   I say probably because
while I know this to be true with a PC Unix I don't know if this really
will be true of Windows NT  I suspect that it will but I don't know
for sure

Interesting  Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster
Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ  successfully  I assure
you that they are both set to IRQ  and that I have no problem  My
computer is a DTK  IBM clone

Running MSDOS or a derivative OS obviously Please take note that the
following is not what exactly happens but a slightly simplified
explanation

Technically the IRQ line is only a means for the device printer
adapter SoundBlaster modem hard disk  to signal the CPU that
Something's happening here please take note How the CPU is
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system
In MSDOS the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the
function that handles each interrupt

Now basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready
to print some more stuff or not  it simply ignores the interrupt  When
DOS prints it looks at the LPT buffer  If there's a character there
wait a while and check again  If there's not copy a new character to
the LPT port  Since the IRQ  is ignored as a printer interrupt it's
free for use for any other adapters  in this case the SB 

With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS this kind of printing
approach just doesn't work or more precisely it wastes a lot of CPU
cycles Hence you can't share the IRQ  with LPT and SB if you're
running Unix or OS or whatnot

Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses
interrupts When the SB plays plain music the CPU simply tells it what
to play until told otherwise With digitized sound the interrupt is
required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is
needed

You can however hook two or more COM ports to one interrupt but use
them only one at a time  This is because the interrupt handling routine
is same for both ports and it can see from which port the data came
from This of course applies for some other devices like LPT as well

Remember this was greatly simplified in parts but I think gives the
general picture correctly enough

it also turned out that

For  more I have a solid external modem built by a company I know

I had one and on three different motherboards it didn't work with NT and

on some systems such as Micronics motherboards it is necessary to
shut off the internal cache on the  to have it work

I've yet to hear from someone running a F on any motherboard with

I went out and bought the PAS yesterday and installed it into my Gateway
DXV I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA  and IRQ
the default and then the PAS side with DMA  and IRQ  My question is how
should I configure for MPU compatibility The manual and installation
program recommended IRQ but on my machine it is configured to cascade to
IRQ So can I still use IRQ or should I choose a different one Right now
I have the MPU emulation mode turned off Actually what is this cascade to
IRQ business  

A related questions to other GW or VLbus machine owners I was told that 
only DMA    are  bit DMAs and  are  bit DMAs Now what about
bit VLbus mastering DMAs Which DMA channels is used by the VLbus
extension to do bit DMA

Yet another question after installing PAS my Links golf game will hang
the machine when I select SB mode and run but works with Adlib mode
Civilization however works fine  at least so far Any body knows what I might
have done wrong 

Thanks I am obviously a newbie  John

speaking of CPU fans

                      Many use clips  make sure you use heat sink
grease or heat transfering tape or you will have wasted your money

Do these CPU Fans also have heat sinks  Do you recommend using both
on the same chip ie heat sink sandwiched between CPU and Fan

If we are just talking about a CPU Fan blowing directly on the CPU chip
I can't see how heat sink grease is necessary or even desireable

Would someone be willing to explain to me the DX MHz is not more
popular than it is  I would think it would be just as fast if not 
faster than the DX MHz for certian applications  Plus a MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future  I must be missing something since everyone is 
buying the DX   Many adds don't even mention the DX 

 Thanks a lot

worked fine  Then I split the line from the jack in the other room ran

I got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem
Now when I try to use the modem QuickLinkII says No dialtone  The phone
plugged into the back of the computer works fine  I tried unplugging the
phone but still no dice  Is it that the phone line was split too many

worked fine  Please note none of the software or hardware parameters
were changed only the phone line itself  Is my new modem faulty  What
can I do 

Try swapping the phone cables in the back of the modem

 I have tried others but I think that the Adaptec is best value for money

I have an Adaptec B and am very happy with it

 
 
   connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable
  Do i have to worry about the power supply I think I have  watts and  
  all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive
 
 
 I dont think you can mix the two types of drive unless you have one of the
 SCSIIDE cards that is available  You will have to turn your IDE off

Not so I have both IDE and an AdaptecB in the same box and can use both
disks at the same time eg IDE to SCSI disk copy

A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card  A pretty nice
board  Fairly fast and seemed quite compatible  even seemed to handle the
SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion  At the time I was just
buying a VLB system so after checking out the card I sent it back  I wanted
a VLB card and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card  This card is fairly fast
will do  Hz refresh at x but is not compatible with my CDROMS
the SVGA thing  I think I have merely conjectured that is the cause of
an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those
programs than the modern boards I have tried  I have not gotten a straight
answer out of anybody  The monitor I am using it with is a  Magnavox
which also tops out at xx Hz so its really a pretty good match

But

That is for my wife  I just purchased a Viewsonic  for myself and am
looking for a graphics card to drive it  I want  Hz refresh
and would really like it to handle my CDRoms  I tried the Orchid P
which did neither of those things though Robert at Wietek did say that the
Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base  So my thoughts go back
to Hercules  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the
Graphite around the end of March  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since
then  Does anyone know if the card was actually released and what capabilities
and price it has

Any info would be most appreciated

There are jumpers on each drive that must be set for both to work  The C drivemust be set to be the master drive and D must be set to be the slave drive

Does anyone know if there are any problems or if it's possible
adding a third hard drivescsi to a dos pc

I currently have a  pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  
Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed  They work great I haven't had
any problems

Well now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
larger  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
to the chainpin ribbon  that  has    connectors   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to formatinitialize the disk

That didn't happen  When the pc boots the  scsi  prom   shoots
back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the boardtarget
targettarget  All three disks are seen

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk I choose to
select another  diskoption  dos and voila it's not there
The first two disks show up no problem but the  third  disk  is
nowhere to be found



ARGH

Ideas anyone

Thanks in advance

I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi

an old Viewsonic  a MAG  a Nanao  not the Trinitron one and
a Sony OEM  which does have a Trinitron tube  The new Viewsonic
beat all of them easily in terms of picture quality and I think it is

Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs IDE question

Wow you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs SCSI thing and I think
it's great

Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive  Right now I have a ms Mb IDE drive Seagate A and
what I would say is a standard not special no cache I believe IDE controller
card on my ISA 

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the Mb to Mb range
And I'm thinking hard you should hear those gears agrinding in my head
about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit  I believe I'm getting
something like Kbsec transfer right now according to NU  How would this
number compare if I bought the stateoftheart SCSI card for my ISA PC and
the stateoftheart SCSI hard drive the wailingest system I could hope for
Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost

Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the topoftheline IDE caching controller for my Mb ms HD
And how much would it cost

I actually have a PAS and could what a waste I guess it would be hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of Kbsec
Actually I have a borrowed ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS SCSI port  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI port  How could I tell  Is the Fujitsu A a SCSI  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI

Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions

  NEC FG or now also available the NEC FGe  only difference
 no ACCUCOLOR   Any experiences or opinions from people who have  
used
 the NEC FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right  
after
 my exams are all done ie about a week from now
 
 	I have a FG and think it is great I haven't seen the  
Nanao's so I
 can't compare but the FG image is very sharp and the color  
contrast is
 extremely good I've used other Trinitron monitors eg a Sun  
SS color
 monitors which is a  Trinitron and think the FG is at least  
as good
 perhaps brighter and has none of these silly horizontal lines  
running across
 	BTW I could be wrong but I thought that the FGe is slower  
as well
 as missing ACCUCOLOR It may not be able to handle x the  
way the FG
 can
 

I believe PC mag said FGE can't do x

Wow you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs SCSI thing and I think
it's great

However I think that some people such as myself would benefit from answers
to the simple question  Which would YOU choose and why

Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive  Right now I have a ms Mb IDE drive Seagate A and
what I would say is a standard not special no cache I believe IDE controller
card on my ISA 

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the Mb to Mb range
And I'm thinking hard you should hear those gears agrinding in my head
about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit  I believe I'm getting
something like Kbsec transfer right now according to NU

How would this
number compare if I bought the stateoftheart SCSI card for my ISA PC and
the stateoftheart SCSI hard drive the wailingest system I could hope for

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost

Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the topoftheline IDE caching controller for my Mb ms HD
And how much would it cost

I actually have a PAS and could what a waste I guess it would be hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of Kbsec
Actually I have a borrowed ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS SCSI port  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI port  How could I tell  Is the Fujitsu A a SCSI  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI

Thanks for any comments

Yes but what if my monitor only has  BNC's on it and is expecting
to get a composite sync signal on the green  There ought to be a
little black box that takes the VGA signalling which has horiz vert
and composite sync on different pins plus the R G and B pairs and
merges the green and composite sync together in the output  It's all
V analog as far as I know  I can build this with opamps but I don't
think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies
involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen

Does anyone know of a VGARGBcomposite sync on green converter

How hot should the CPU in a  DX machine be

Currently it gets so hot that I can not hold a finger on it for more than
 s 

I keep a big fan blowing on it but am considering using a heat sink

Any advice
	  Don't hold your finger on it
	  When cooking with it use a very small pan and be sure
	  to not spill liquids on the components
	  If you do not plan to cook with it there are a number of
	  small cooling fans designed to mount on the chip and plug
	  into your power supply  Look in Consumer Shoppers

	Now if only some innovative person could design and produce
a heat sink which could be used to keep my coffee warm why I might
even buy a Pentium

That is for my wife  I just purchased a Viewsonic  for myself and am
looking for a graphics card to drive it  I want  Hz refresh
and would really like it to handle my CDRoms  I tried the Orchid P
which did neither of those things though Robert at Wietek did say that the
Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base  So my thoughts go back
to Hercules  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the
Graphite around the end of March  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since
then  Does anyone know if the card was actually released and what capabilities
and price it has

  Hmm your CDRom program must be using some oddball VGA modes

  I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month when
it is released though it'll be in limited quantities I think they
have quite a back order right now the  megs version will come out
a bit later

  Since you have a Viewsonic  I think it has a khz horizontal
frequency right you're gonna love the  megs version  It can
do xx at Hz xx at Hz xx at Hz
xx at Hz  It can also do xx mil and
xx bit at Hz too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth 
monitor like yours   most of those modes need a khz monitor
otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate

  If you want more info about the coming Graphite VL you should
go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve IBMHW in the
video sig  There're several Hercules reps there that are very
helpful

Looking for help in just the right place

Does anyone have experience with the Promise Technology Caching
IDE Controller DCM  I just ordered one  with k installed
and have a few questions

  Is it easy to use  Does it need any kind of TSR's or is
it completely transparent to the system board so that I won't
have to change the bios configuration

Yes it's easy to use It's just like an ordinary controller
You don't have to change the bios config

  Is it transparent to the IDE drive  Will it work with any drive
or does it have to be configured explicity for the type of drive
installed

It's transparent It works with any drive If you change the
drive you only need to change the bios config as usual

  Will it work with a dualdrive system master and slave
Yes no problem


  With it will I need smartdrive or DOS buffers
That depends You will get a little better performance
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition That's
because access to the card through the ISA bus is slower
than access to system RAM I don't use smartdrive myself
but I have a few buffers


  Is the Promise Technology controller a good one

Any information would be greatly appreciated  Thanks

 Is this true I was under the impression that people on the net had both  
 SCSI and IDE working together

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now
SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives

to get it to work with odd environments

For information purposes I had

My  DX is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip

It attaches with peel off adhesive  This is a full size AT case so
the fan has gravity in its favor  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable
There are other board type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them  They are powered by the slot  I  don't
know how effective they are maybe someone else could comment

The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCPC unit

PCConnection at  has them for    next day

power supply  PCPC make the best power supplies available IMHO

Hi

I bought on the net here a minitower dx system  It works fine but
I have no docs on the motherboard

Does anyone know who a manufacturer named WPI is  That is the only marking
on the board that is not related to a chipconnector name  It says
c WPI

Also this board has a connector at the other end of the motherboard it looks
like this


  
    Batt                           
                                  Socket for  math coprocessor
                                   
                                   chip is about here
                                   
                    J    signs are the ISA slots
                    M 
                        P   Jumpers for turbokb etc are where
              E   marked
              R 
              S    signs are  banks of SIMM sockets
                      
                 These connectors are the mystery
       connectors
                        
                       What is this connector

Is this a place to plug an extra memory board in  I've seen thatr mentioned
in some motherboard docs  Some allow an meg card and  meg in simms  Is

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the  version 
improving my graphic winmarks v by about  million  to

I have an internal modem that I configure as COM with IRQ  but
when I insert that card into my DOS  PC it shows up
as COM with IRQ and COM's address E

When I get into debug and dump the data at  it shows
the address E as belonging to COM  even though the modem
should be at COM

Now I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested
it in a different PC  and it shows up correctly as COM E IRQ

To make it work in the DOS  PC I have to configure the
modem as COM E IRQbut though I have a comm program that
allows that the FAX program that came with the modem does not work
Anyway I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set
as COM
I did run a few diagnostic programs and they did not help at all
a few displayed the modem as COM and others displayed it as
being COM

I am not using Windows this is just a DOS problemAny help
or pointers appreciated
For various reasons I must have this modem work at COM thus
switching COM ports is not an answer

Last time I posted this I did not get any DOS specific answer
this time I have included all the specific informationplease help

I've noticed a recent proliferation of  gig SCSI  drives in
particular the Fujitsu  and the Micropolis  There is also the
Maxtor LXTs  rpm  gig drive They are all quite cheap
and have nice  year warranties 

My questions are Is there a catch
                  Which one is better
                  What type of SCSI do these drives use
                  Is the service generally better for one of these     
         
                  manufacturers
                  Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason

thanks

Well I've installed DOS  in three different systems with and without 
stacker A friend installed it in two other systems both with stacker

Not a single problem except perhaps some minor bugs with configsys
menus

He's right ya know  I've helped to install Dos  on about  computers now
mine included  On one he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter
and it worked fine rather he sent in the coupon for the converter

In other cases I've run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive compressing free space or whatever else
Seems to work for me

Ofcourse we did NOT repeat NOT run any program called install 
or setup or a very sophisticated AI autoconfiguring setup 
installation program that will think for you and do what you never wanted to
do but couldn't stop it from doing

Well I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's
worth

Also DBLSPACE is crap It writes about  slower than stacker reads about
 slower and compresses about  LESS All tests were made on the same
computer with the same disk no cache and the same big files were used

Couldn't agree more  On my  I don't miss the speed  It's still
faster than a normal disk read would be  As for the less compression
I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspacebin
load before anything else  With Stacker any changes to your configsys
or autoexecbat meant rebooting twice so it could update those

Personally I'm waiting for Stacker  to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff  Plus the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay but I
much prefer COMPRESS from PCTOOLS for sheer bells and whistles  Plus
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive

But DOS  is quite good reformat disks I honestly don't understand WHY
you had to do this

Ditto

greetings
I'm a novice in messing comp hardware
My original IDE HD is a MB Western Digital which came with the system
when I bought it And I just got a MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to
add as a slave drive I did change the jumper settings on A Maxtor to
configure it as slave drv but I didn't change anything on my M Western
Dig since I didn't have any doc on it And as I predicted It just beeped
and gave me an error message about HDD controller
So I had to take my M off  install my A to be my only HD
 
any help on this matter would be much appreciated
before I trashed my MB
 
Thankx much

Which would YOU choose and why

Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive  Right now I have a ms Mb IDE drive Seagate A and
a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the Mb to Mb range
And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit
I believe I'm getting something like Kbsec transfer right now according
to NU

How would this number compare if I bought the stateoftheart SCSI card for
my ISA PC and the stateoftheart SCSI hard drive the best system I could
hope for

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost

Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the topoftheline IDE caching controller for my Mb ms HD
And how much would it cost

Thanks for any comments

Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on Remember
those  Mb disks that look and feel like  floppies These drives
are SCSI devices and can read and write both  Kb and  Mb
disks Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market Are the
prices really that unaffordable compared to CDROMs which are currently
not rewritable I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to
develop the first MDs for the computer My question is why isn't there
any substantial interest in developing the flopticals

Just a thought

don't know why it would do this unless you're out of paper that is

It does allow be to go on line with green

when you power up the printer assuming it does have paper the red power

 The April  issue of PC Magazine published benchmarks for the ATI UltraPro

 VLB							

This a wightened speed avarage for many windows tasks The original

   Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software

The Ethernet card doesn't use the IP number bits usually
 it uses the Ethernet address bits usually
 I have never run across an Ethernet controller that
cannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it
DECNET requires this feature

However that said there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet
address  They are globally unique the first three bytes being
assigned to the manufacturer by the IEEE and the last three by the
manufacturer

 GL   I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null

 GL statement  What I'm  asking is what pins does it use or what are
 GL it's specifications  I just want  to solder one myself instead of
 GL buying one  I don't even know what port is  used

You may want to save yourself the trouble and go to Radio Shack  They have
a null modem adapter which is a  pin connector that swaps the necessary
pins to allow two machines to communicate  These are a lot easier than
soldering the connections yourself and usually a bit more reliable

Diamond Video cards stealth viper speedstar etc 
may have excellent specifications and the windows drivers that
come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast BUT

If you're considering buying a system with a view to using
it to run Unix Linux bsd etc or some other special software
there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards
This is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware
it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
agreements

This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
XWindows compatibility with these cards as diamond didn't want to 
divulge programming neccessities

As far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on it's info

I have got an Adaptec SCSI card that comes with its own version of FDISK
The problem with DOS is that it will only see two hard disks any more need to be

 files  I have tried all different types of setups and even changed IDE
 controller cards  If I boot from a floppy everything works great except
 the booting part   The system doesn't report an error message or anything
 just hangs there  Does anyone have any suggestions or has somebody else
 run into a similar problem  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios
 on one of the drives is this possible  Any suggestionsanswers would be
 greatly appreciated  Please reply to

Make sure that the hard disk you want to boot from is set as active using the
FDISK program that comes with DOS

Perry Perhaps you should try nicfunetfi instead of funetfi

Hi peeps

Here's another of those any ideas type queries

I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy without
a keyboard  But no problem so far

When I dismantled it I discovered that it is really just a standard
RGB monitor with built in modemROM software etc

Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs so I
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked  sort of

The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines
The display rolls continuously but does change modes OK only to
CGA  but useful for my laptop

Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors

I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort but Phillips Computer
is now under the auspices of DEC at least in the UK  DEC said
sorry Phillips don't make it any more What is it anyway
A UK support dealer said Circuit diagrams Sync

So any ideas

John

I'm arguing with the phone company about a similar problem  We

one of them is on THEIR line the modem returns NO DIAL TONE on its

When we pick up the phone and listen we can hear my kids' voices
bleed through  Whenever we can hear this the modem won't dial even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker

I think it's the phone company's problem but they say they can't

Seeing all these questions about uart types their availability and their
relative merits wouldn't it be fine if for internal highspeed modems there
were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and
instead accessing directly the relatively large sendreceive buffers of the  
modem thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies 
Just an idea

Depends on the FDC but generally No  The drive at the end after the twist 
should be set as Drive 
What about the terminating resistor pack that's in the  floppy  
Which connector should go into which drive
Since you're using the  as drive A it should be at the end after the 
twist with the resistor pack fitted
Does pin on the connector always correspond with pin on the floppy
drive
Yes
 Stuff deleted

Hope this helps  I had exactly the same problems  Unfortunately when
I changed to different machine the problems started again because
of a different FDC  Seems don't flame me this is mainly guess work
from practicle experience that some FDC's do different things with the 
select

Do all SCSI cards for DOS systems require a separate device driver to
be loaded into memory for each SCSI device hooked up

No All that I've seen have also an onboard BIOS which enables you to
use up to  hard drives directly under DOS  drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter Software drivers often allow for better
performance though You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than  disks

Will this also be true of the bit OS's

Obviously these are not able to use the bit real mode BIOSes that
are written for DOS so you need software drivers That's not a big
deal as long as the drivers are available because you won't have to
fight with any low memory problems either

When posting Winmark results it is a good idea to give the version of 
WinBench that you used to obtain the scores as well as the resolution that
you tested and the version of the drivers

Doesn't anybody actually read the licence agreement of WinBench
before blindly running it The licence agreement very clearly says
that details about hardware configuration driver resolution and
other relevant facts MUST be included when giving WinMark results

ZiffDavis wants everybody to do this and that requirement makes
sense really Plain numbers are useless when resolution driver and
machine are unknown

When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation

I don't know for sure whether the LX supports this Sun certainly won't tell

hi folks

first question which is the best way to share hard disks
and printer
ps my two pc will be far about  meter and i like to use
a parallel port or ethernet card and i like to share resource
under dos linux os and windows   nt

 which  i think to buy  dx mzh local bus
  but i heard that some board coulnd't work properly 
  cause some incompatibilites is that true

  should a  dx  mhz a better solution

  in case i buy local bus it's better to buy an accelerated
  svga card with a normal local bus ide controller
  or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated
  with a normal ide controller

    is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color 
      svga card at which price   
   i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read
     musical photo kodak and computer cd rom
     i have heard about a sony and a mitsumi which is best
     and which controller work with its

I am planning on upgrading my old XT compatible system with a new
motherboard hard drive and  MB floppy

I am interested in using my old power supply  W to power the new
hardware if possible  

I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably
use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard
Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only  wires  the
th wire is a v line used to charge the motherboard battery

My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire
out of an  wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source
to charge the motherboard battery

I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can 
make use of my existing one with simple hacks

Thank you for any information  
An email reply to rarbanasrcsunagmrcom would be fine

For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC tape drive
and an everex bit full size controller in my dx EISA system with no
luck I end up getting an error miscompare during the streaming read
part of the test I am pretty certain that the port setting irq  dma are
set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands rewind
retension write and erase I also booted the system clean and still the
same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts It has been
suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down
My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting
option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this Am I going to
have to accept that this set up won't work or can anyone suggest a work
around I will be glad to hear your advicesuggestions

 Well now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another

 to the chainpin ribbon  that  has    connectors   and   run

 When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk I choose to
 select another  diskoption  dos and voila it's not there
 The first two disks show up no problem but the  third  disk  is
 nowhere to be found


I have got an Adaptec SCSI card that comes with its own version of FDISK
The problem with DOS is that it will only see two hard disks any more need to be
done by device drivers


ODD FDISK works fine for me with  IDE drives and a SCSI drive on
my Ultrastor F  only with the device driver loaded though

 dropped to below  but the price of the Courier remains above 
 
 Anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a Courier
 
 The Sportster at  has v error control and v bis data compression
 This is becoming standard on all these high speed modems  The difference
 with the Courier is that it can run at  and only in the HST mode 

The courrier will not run at  only the Dual Standard HST the USR
modem over   my courrier will do up to  and with compression
error correction much more it will do v vbis v vbis
v etc etc and ASL too whatever asl is

discussing the use of IRQ 

In  recent article mspraguesuperiormcwbstb Mike Sprague writes

I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
I can't prove it's true but I believe it LPT does not
actually use IRQ even though that interrupt is supposed to
be dedicated to LPT

To put it a little differently

  IRQ  is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity

  DOS doesn't monitor IRQ  it uses other means to determine when it's
   time to send out another byte to the printer

  Most all hardware printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ  usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tristate driver and by programming just leave it
   in the highimpedence mode

  Unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers ie either assert high or assert low for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers assert high assert low or don't
   assert anything  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper

   Incidentally note that there's no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines and
   that certainly isn't a requirement

  NonDOS operating systems OS NT  various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be require the use of IRQ  for performance
   reasons  

And the SB alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers

 Can someone recommend a decent VESA Local Bus SCSI controller
 card  I saw a post for the Ultrastor something or other and
 was wondering if this would be a good choice  I need a supported
 card that software like the March NT Beta will recognize

BusLogic just announced the BT FAST SCSI VLB Interface as of
April   This always happens to me

I have a one week old BTS which is the ISA version  I am
enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC mb ms
 HH  RPM drive  I'll be changing to the BT VERY soon
though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with
the bit VESA support

You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question I hear that
the support is excellent   I have not had to call them myself yet

Couldn't agree more  On my  I don't miss the speed  It's still
faster than a normal disk read would be  As for the less compression

I recall reading a review article in PC Computing wherein they reported
a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker 
This was not due to the compression algorithm per se but to the fact
that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access Does
anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stacker

all of those with whom I've chatted have NOT been thrilled with the

strange misdrawn objects trails etc  Many have also voiced their
strong discontent to Diamond's ambivalent attitude toward OS drivers

Come to think of it though I hear and see a lot of complaints about

Does ANYONE have an accelerated video board with drivers for Windows

 Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on Remember
 those  Mb disks that look and feel like  floppies These drives
 are SCSI devices and can read and write both  Kb and  Mb
 disks Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market Are the
 prices really that unaffordable compared to CDROMs which are currently
 not rewritable I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to
 develop the first MDs for the computer My question is why isn't there
 any substantial interest in developing the flopticals

Certainly in the UK the Mb flopticals are about the same price as a
cheap CDROM now you seem to be able to get them for around GBP
 However the bigger optical drives eg Mb are much more
expensive  around the GBP  mark

A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer  the Mb
flopticals  are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do
they need driver software etc Ie do you just rip out the floppy
drive plug the same cables into the floptical stick in a floptidisk
and hey presto you have a Mb floppy This sounds far too easy

On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers I have reread a
PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing
optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a
product themselves From the article it seems that the audio MD format
is a byproduct of their computer storage work  the MD  mechanism is
identical to their MO computer optical drives A Sony spokesman was
quoted as saying that a  MD disk would hold about Mb of data
though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being
productized

The article said that one of the problems holding back development in
this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 
distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present Given that it
probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it
into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it
probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead
to get MDs accepted

If you're considering buying a system with a view to using
it to run Unix Linux bsd etc or some other special software
there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards

That is if the special software is free like Xfree  There are
vendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices  But
then they charge 

This is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware
it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
agreements

I think they only need a signing ie no paying  This still
violates the FSF's policy of publically available code

This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
XWindows compatibility with these cards as diamond didn't want to 
divulge programming neccessities

While this is true there are fixes for those who have already
bought Diamond cards  In Linux for example there are utilities
that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X  Of course
this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards but at least this
will allow those who're stuck with them to use LinuxX

I agree with Mark's suggestion  If you are buying a video card
for specialized free software avoid Diamond  But if you already
have one there may be a fix that can help you

battery is soldered to the bord an all three machines is still under

As far as I know there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by 
shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory thereby erasing it This 
will remove the password but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS 
settings so then you'll have to go and set them all up again On my  
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of 
shorting the battery You just short this jumper briefly and it interrupts 
power to the CMOS long enough to erase it I would imagine there is 
something like this on your board too 

In the future I would suggest that YOU set the password and leave it on 
Setup only That way noone else can go and reset it or set it to 
Always unless they know what password you used They had to do this over

Would someone be willing to explain to me the DX MHz is not more
popular than it is  I would think it would be just as fast if not 
faster than the DX MHz for certian applications  Plus a MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future  I must be missing something since everyone is 
buying the DX   Many adds don't even mention the DX 

 Thanks a lot

HI
 that might look like a dull request but I have been following this newgroup
for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind

  I bought a new  machine not long ago after being disconnected from the
pc world for a while I have been running on an xt MHz till last january
The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL  graphic card It
gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable The only
problem is that it is quite slow

I would like to go for a faster card not in the  range I saw a lot
of comments on many products over the last weeks but didn't get an overall
picture clear enough to make a choice My question is  Could somebody
direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest
I would like to get information about 
      the refresh rates the various cards provide
      quality of windows drivers
      standard vga performance nonWindows stuff

Direct me to a magazine article or something like that I got winvidzip 
info but it is not enough If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied
with it  let me know
	If this information is of any use here is my system configuration
	 Fujikama  MHz ISA system Contaq motherboard
	 monitor DARIUS  noninterlaced multisync up to X 
                               can reach kHz horizontally  

I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow
screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the
graphic card This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient
when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent 
enough to record settings

Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me

Yes its realy simple no one makes a mother board that runs the
bus at more than MHZSam
 
This isn't quite true  depending on the number of local bus slots and
whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board it is
possible to run local bus at up to  and  mhz I've also spoken to a few 
people who run standard local bus video cards at  mhz without trouble
and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed

Just got a MHz DX system and am considering getting a fan for the
CPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a
fairly good idea long ago when I did some electronics training I read
somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctionsgates etc
slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature hence a hot
chip goes offspec sooner

Has anyone out there got a CPU fan

yes

Is there more than  type

yes seen glueon tapeon clipon oneinch square and larger
my favorite is the  inch plastic USToyo fan I use just plopped
down on top of the chip during opencase service

Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan

depends on the mounting

Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines

only if the manufacturer was smart

Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans

only if it goes out  got that blanket effect which doesn't help chip life

Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of money

longer system life makes good economic sense to me

How are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese

yes  well not the melted cheese

Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to without

lets you touch the surface  the rule of thumb for cooling solidstate

  an advert I've read claims F vs F

Any info appreciated

the attached fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing

I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu  depends a lot on case and board layout though

onchip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about  I
get the stock power supply fans for about

Another possibility is that the MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C drive and D
drive setup info rather than drive  and drive  like most others
I've seen  Could this be confusing things

So I need HELP  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some
info for the CMOS setup the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card I cannibalized the cable it's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so
it looks like a serial connection now I be lost

I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you 
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
up for two hard drives from the beginning  I took him at his word and I 
have not tried to find out any more about it because I'm not going to back 
everything up just to add another HDD  If anyone knows for sure what the 
scoop is I would like to know also  Thanks in advance also

Bill Willis



If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer you shouldn 't have to 
perform a low level format Even if the st HD is already partitioned
into C and D FDISK will automatically assign the  nd HD to D and 
change the nd partition of st drive to E

Check the jumper settings and CMOS setup in particular the correct
number of cylinders and tracks

a solution to running a pc with peace and quiet Short of buying a notebook

Silencer  which is supposed to be more quiet Has anyone had experience with
this I was quoted a price of   for a Watt Silencer

I've even considered stuffing my PC case in one of those acoustic printer 
enclosures but that wouldn't be the most elegant solution Also I'm 
guessing that would also cut the ventilation

Any other ideas

Yes this is a valid concern IMHO  With the directly attached fan units I've
seen it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all  In other words if the fan stops
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
suffer permanent damage not just stop working temporarily

 I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
 to blow air across the cpu  depends a lot on case and board layout though
 
My Zeos DX tower case has a passive heat sink on the cpu and it's
located so the front fan which sucks air into the case blows right on the
heat sink  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air
flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise  Essentially the 
arrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO

 onchip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about  I
 get the stock power supply fans for about

Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion echoed by a couple of people
who responded to the original request for help  The ATI VLB video board
uses the addresses for COM   They could suggest no work around
I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM  even though it
could not possibly work for credit against a bus mouse  This will free
up the COM port I need  too bad the original salesman who suggested either
the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know
enough about the hardware

Otherwise I must say that the DX system has worked very well  no

Hi
	I am buying a Quantum LPSAT  MB hardisk and is deciding a
	HDDFDD controller Is bit VLbus HDDFDD controller faster 
	than  bit IDE HDDFDD controller card I hear that
	the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller
	Which one is true

The VLIDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use I am using a NoName VLIDE IO Contr
it is tested under coretest with  kbs using a cheap Seagate  and nearly
 kbs using a WDCaviar  you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess fastest setting gets  kbs under Coretest
but does not work reliable You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast
speed I havent used a VLIDECache controller yet but it might speed up twice

I purchased one personal computer and three for business from them No

about a video driver and I had no problem getting through

All four machines seem to be high quality and well made  A dx EISA 
machine has been our network file server running  hrs per day since last

I hope this is helpful

 Once again someone else with a Gateway Monitor problem anyone who can
 help please do it would be much apprieciated  Thanks in advance
 
 Ok I have a Local Bus  machine with the Crystal Scan inch
 monitor  I have  meg of loca memory on the ATI ultra pro w the
 mach driver the newest release
 
 My problem is in Windows when I use the  mode I get shadows down
 the sides of the screens and very blurry type in the corners  The
 types on the screen are all out of focus I've gotten replacement video
 cards and a replacement monitor  None of that has helped though
 Could someone pleae help me with this very frustruating problem

I have the  meg card with the Crystal Scan  inch also  I see very
faint shadows on the left side of the screen only in  x  mode
but not enough to really bother me  The characters on the screen
are clear until I turn on the Crystal Fonts then they become blurry

I have a friend who has  meg on the video card who has the same shadows
but says the Crystal Fonts are well crystal clear

We are both using build  of the mach drivers Neither of us has a monitor
extension cable  I tried the build driver and found no difference

LPT ports don't recognize baud parity etc settings  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port  Try this attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings  Try

CMODE COMN

to set the port parameters  Then use the MODE command to redirect the
printer port LPT like this

CMODE LPTCOM

This should work  Good luck

	First you need to connect them with a null modem cable

Atleast thats what I've heard

Connecting devices

 
  Normally a  wire connection is used Connect
        GND    to    GND
	RxD    to    TxD
	TxD    to    RxD
	DTR    to    DSR
	DSR    to    DTR
	RTS    to    CTS
	CTS    to    RTS
  If a modem is connected add lines for the following
        RI DCD
  If software wants it connect DCD to CTS and DCD to CTS
  BEWARE While PCs use pin  for RxD and pin  for TxD modems normally
have those pins reversed This allows to easily connect pin to pin pin
to pin  etc If you connect two PCs cross RxD and TxD
 
  If hardware handshaking is not needed a socalled nullmodem connection
can be used Connect
        GND    to    GND
	RxD    to    TxD
	TxD    to    RxD
Additionally connect if software needs it
        RTS    to    CTS  DCD
	RTS    to    CTS  DCD
	DTR    to    DSR
	DTR    to    DSR
You won't need long wires for these
  The nullmodem connection is used to establish an XONXOFFtransmission
between two PCs see software section for details
  Remember the names DTR DSR CTS  RTS refer to the lines as seen from
the PC This means that for your data set DTR  RTS are incoming signals
and DSR  CTS are outputs

 the attached fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential
 loss of cooling if the fan goes out at least with the power supply fan you
 can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing
 
 Yes this is a valid concern IMHO  With the directly attached fan units I've
 seen it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
 a good bit worse than no heat sink at all  In other words if the fan stops
 the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
 suffer permanent damage not just stop working temporarily
 
 A suggestion  Slave hook in series a small pilot light off the fan
circuit  Then if the light goes out you know your fan is not working

  This may be a very naive question but is there any
  basis for the
  claim that a CPU will get hotter when a
  computationally intensive
  job is running My friend claims that there will be
  little difference
  in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a
  computationally
  intensive job

From what I've seen in coursework most CPUs never actually
idle  They will continue to service interrupts etc
etc  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter
what it's doing

I suppose depending on the instruction the CPU may use
circuitry which has more transistors than other
instructions but if you consider the additional heat
generated by only a handful of additional tiny resistors
and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's
packaging the change in temperature to the immediate
environment ie the surface of the package will be
negligible

Has anybody every come across a problem whereby a hard disk locks up ie crashes the system when attempting to load disk caching

I think the logic board may have been buggered but the drive works PERFECTLY without a disk cache

I tried HyperDisk and various versions of SmartDRIVE all to no avail

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated  I need a cached drive but I need the extra space of my second drive just as much 

Thanks

   On a few computers which we have here at Sheridan College there are
files which we would like to make read only  I have used the Dos attrib command
but some people who carry around the attrib program in their pockets
have still been able to erase some of the more important files  Are
there any software packages which would make an entire drive readonly
An example partition the drive into two partitions and have the first
drive contain the important files which can be only read and the second
drive you could both read and write  
  Any and all enquiries or help would be appreciated

Howdy

I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 
with a Phoenix replacement BIOS in order to support an IDE hard drive
and a highdensity  floppy

I assumed that this would be a plugandplay procedure but I have
encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit
responsibilty for and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it

Everything is hunkydory except the  floppy which will read but NOT
WRITE diskettes  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs

I have tried everything I can think of

Any takers

I have a floppy drive which has developed General failure errors It's a Teac Mb  drive

I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now

However it didn't help the problem  I've also identified that when the machine boots and the drive seeks for a boot disk the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector

Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive I'd prefer not to shell out  for a new one if I can help it

Thanks

Cheers Ben

I'm afriad that's not true  The monitor problem seems to occur whenever
the  Mag monitor is put into x mode  I'm running OS at  and
the same symptoms appear

It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic  chip and
the ATI GUP seem to cause these problems two VERY  different cards

Below is the list of large at least  inches diagonal monochrome
monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible  I've omitted
Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a Khz
horizontal frequency which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature and will report back to the net after I've
studied it

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship
to reality

This may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the
claim that a CPU will get hotter when a computationally intensive 
job is running

I totally agree with your friend since when the CPU is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
checking for keyboard input for instance  

The exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops where the CPU can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again

Actually the iAPX family has a HALT instruction that causes the CPU to
cease processing instructions  The CPU resumes processing either by being
reset or by receiving an external hardware interrupt  This is different
from the power management facilities Victor mentions  Of course whether an
operating system's idle loop uses the HALT instruction is another matter
entirely

 Which would YOU choose and why

I have both

I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box

IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it
has a SCSI hard disk CDROM and tape

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up

Faster drives are also available for SCSI  I have a DEC DSPs that realy
does have a ms average seek time IE it finds data  faster than my ms
Toshiba drive

 
 Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
 the hard drive  Right now I have a ms Mb IDE drive Seagate A and
 a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 

I don't think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus 

 
 I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the Mb to Mb range
 And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit
 I believe I'm getting something like Kbsec transfer right now according
 to NU

KBs is pretty good

 
 How would this number compare if I bought the stateoftheart SCSI card for
 my ISA PC and the stateoftheart SCSI hard drive the best system I could
 hope for

Many state of the art SCSI disks use the SAME mechanicals as many state of the
art IDE drives Only the interface electronis differ  look at the MB Fijitsu
drive for an example

 
 Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would
 YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost

I use an Adaptec B on my Unix box and noname IDE cards on both

 
 Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
 were to buy the topoftheline IDE caching controller for my Mb ms HD
 And how much would it cost

Caching controller Why What does it give you that smartdrive  for DOS  does 
not About KB extra lower memory That's about it

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at MBs That's
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain

 Would someone be willing to explain to me the DX MHz is not more
 popular than it is  I would think it would be just as fast if not 
 faster than the DX MHz for certian applications  Plus a MHz 
 motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
 chip in the future  I must be missing something since everyone is 
 buying the DX   Many adds don't even mention the DX 
 
  Thanks a lot

 Yes its realy simple no one makes a mother board that runs the
 bus at more than MHZSam

Which bus

I think there are several reasons 

MHz motherboards are harder to get right
MHz need a fast L cache  ns is a good idea
MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
MHz DX chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good fast L cache a DX is going be be faster than a DX

What do I have

A DX of course

 After reading many postings concerning hard drives I'm still unclear
 about one thing  These new cached hard drives  is the cache on the
 drive itself or is it separate like on the controller or something
 Thanks to anyone who can clear this up

I have two SCSI hard drives each has KB of 'cache'

There several reasons for this 

When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be
busy This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted

When the drive receives data to be written the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk It needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out

In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache

May be the drive does some readadead caching as well

 	These LPT COM disk controller are call devices  There are

 	does not require exclusive ownership ie it will share an
 	interrupt with another device eg LPT
 
 No  In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all nonlaptop PCs use
 two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt  This is due to
 a screwup in the bus design  For example if your Soundblaster wants
 to drive interrupt number  then it must hold a certain bus wire to 
 or  at all times depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt
 This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 
 
 When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's
 because they're implemented by a single card

Interesting  Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster
Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ  successfully  I assure
you that they are both set to IRQ  and that I have no problem  My
computer is a DTK  IBM clone

Simple  First Andrew is correct although I can see where there might be
some confusion  It is indeed possible to have two cards configured to use
the same interrupt  They can not share the interrupt in the sense that it
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time

Here is an example  For some time I was short of free interrupts  I had a
tape controller not a floppy tape that needed one of IRQIRQ  It's an
old tape drive  My solution was to use IRQ also used for COM where my
modem is  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and
the tape simultaneously  When kermit runs it installs its own interrupt
handler for IRQ and uses the serial port  If the tape drive were to generate
an interrupt kermit would not have a clue what to do withfor the tape
controller  And since the tape controller would not be serviced it would
most likely hang  Likewise when the tape backup software runs it
installs an interrupt handler for IRQ  That handler won't do anything for
the serial port

Under DOS printing is NOT interruptdriven  Instead the BIOS polls the
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent
That's why you can have your sound card and LPT both configured to use IRQ
Try that on NT and see how far you'll get

Quantum LPSA hard disk phantom seeks

I just purchased and installed a MB Quantum  hard drive model
LPSA and have a concern about its behavior

Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file IO it performs what I call phantom seeks

When the PC is absolutely idle I can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every  seconds lasting  seconds This activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never
comes on The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card not
the drive

My other hard disk a Seagate STA does not have this kind
behavior

Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon

No All that I've seen have also an onboard BIOS which enables you to
use up to  hard drives directly under DOS  drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter Software drivers often allow for better
performance though You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than  disks

No  The Always IN among others requires no drivers for up to  SCSI
hard drives  DOS does not have a  drive maximum as I already have  All

can display  million colours in x mode with MB DRAM

It comes with ETW window drivers and a normal Et drivers
The ETW drivers handles x x x in  colours
Also in x and x it supports hicolor K and K colours

Here is my winmark result running on a MB DX EISAVLBUS system using
Hint chipsets

Winmark  from ZD lab

Using ETW drivers
x         megapixelsec
        k         
        k        
x        
        k        
        k        
kx          

Using ET drivers
x M        
x  colours      
kx           

From the result the ETW drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the EtW chip whereas the ET drivers are
just normal driver for ET based graphics card

The price of this graphics card that I got is  from a local dealer
It may be less from mail order It has OS  drivers comes with it
which supports  colors on all resolution

From these results it has double the performance of a EtAX based card
in  colours mode

Would someone be willing to explain to me the DX MHz is not more
popular than it is  I would think it would be just as fast if not
faster than the DX MHz for certian applications  Plus a MHz
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future  I must be missing something since everyone is
buying the DX   Many adds don't even mention the DX 


One of the things going for the DX over the  is that it's
clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec

Lance Hartmann lancehartmannaustinibmcomibmpaawdpaibmcom

A couple other problems with the DX

  System manufacturers had MAJOR problems solving the electromagnetic 
interference problems with DX systems  Getting an FCCB home use 
certification required additional shielding in the system

  HEATa lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks andor cooling 
fans on their DX chips  I would guess that the DX ran 
temperatures inside the case even hotter  And heat is the enemy of system 
reliability

I must say that I have been a customer of Midwest Micro for over 
years now and have been well taken care of on each purchase
I have had many friends that have bought that same modem and THEY
do have some experience with setting up modems so there have been
no problems in  of them that I know of The fact that your time
to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong
WHY you say because I must tell you of the  yes I say  PPI modems
that I have had in the past that I was trying to use on my bbs They
all were junk and were replace  times each to ther point that
I just said forget it and I wanted my money back PPI's teck even
said that they didn't even repair them That they just strip the
parts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem
I think it was more your fault than Midwest Mirco's faulktSam
 
GoshI think I just installed a virusIt was called MS DOS

What ever happened to the idea that the Customer is ALWAYS right

PS I consider Midwaste Micro's technique of slapping their own name
     on a product to be misleading especially if it was not originally
     manufactured with that intent in mind

I have a Headland Technologies Video Seven VRAMII board that only
came with K at the time this was ok but

I need info or help with upgrading this board to  Mbyte  There are
 rows of pins over the VRAM chips I think for a piggyback board
of VRAM  I would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help
me upgrade this board  Maybe someone from Headland who maybe read
ing this has one of these piggyback boards just laying around please
please please

Does anyone know of where I could maybe buy the upgrade for this  I
would sure love to use this in X color mode but for the time
being I can only get  of the screen with the bottom part a white
strip obviously because of the missing VRAM actually I'm surprised
it even works to this degree at all

As a last resort I will wind up selling this board  and probably be
getting a  MbET based dumb frame buffer  This VRAMII was Editors
Choice in the  PC Mag  So if anyone has any info please email
or as a last resort post to this group  Thanks in advance

The  MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs Most
of the DX boards have too slow caches that make them effectively
DXs Also as someone else pointed out local bus boards are
better off at  MHz bus speed The k internal cache allows the
DX to be generally faster anyway

	I am right now working on an MPRII certified Swedish standards for
low emissions Hitachi Superscan  monitor  It's x up to hz at
that res and it got a good writeup for image quality in a recent Feb
issue of PC Magazine  As far as I know very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality at least according to the mags  I can't tell any
difference between the two but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types  There's VLF Very Low Frequency and ELF I think that's
Extremely Low Frequency  The MPRII standards set strict limits on both
But many comapnies NEC included according to one article I read I get a
bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which which claim low
emissions but not specifically MPRII Compliant or MPRII Certified
only control for one usually VLF and ignore the other
	So the NEC probably has higher overall image quality I consis
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi  I like my image quality but for all I know you
may be more discerning  Good luck

I finally can get a dbench v from a ftp site

The dbench of ETW in my Cardex W card with MB DRAM
has superscape benchmark of  framessec

Hope it will satisfy people curiosity of this ETW performance

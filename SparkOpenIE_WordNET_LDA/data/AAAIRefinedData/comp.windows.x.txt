XRULES
X
X    To help us with the volume of entries we ask that you follow these rules
X
X     Your entry must be a complete program
X
X     Your entry must be   bytes in length  The number of characters
X       excluding whitespace tab space newline and excluding any   or 
X       followed by either whitespace or end of file must be  
X
X     Your entry must be submitted in the following format
X
Xentry
Xrule	
Xfix	y or n   n  this is a new entry y  this replaces an older entry
Xtitle	title of entry  		    see comments below
Xentry	Entry number from  to  inclusive  your st entry should by 
Xdate	Datetime of submission in UTC	    see comments below
Xhost	Machines and OSs under which your entry was tested
X	Use tab indented lines if needed
Xremark
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with  spaces though it is not a
X    requirement  Also if possible try to avoid going beyond the th
X    column  Blank lines are permitted
Xauthor
Xname	your name
Xorg	SchoolCompanyOrganization
Xaddr	postal address
X	use tab indented lines to continue
X	don't forget to include the country
Xemail  Email address from a well known site or registered domain
X        If you give several forms list them on separate tab indented lines
Xanon	y or n   y  remain anonymous n  ok to publish this info
Xinfo
XIf your program needs an info file place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section  In the case of multiple info files use multiple info
Xsections  If your entry does not need a info file skip this section
Xbuild
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the commands used to compilebuild your program
Xin this section  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'  The resulting
Xfile must be  bytes or less
Xprogram
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'progc'  The resulting file must follow rule 
Xend
X
X      Regarding the above format
X
X	 The title must match the expression azAZazAZ
X	  and must be  to  characters in length
X
X	  It is suggested but not required that the title should
X	  incorporate your username in the case of multiple authors
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors
X
X	 The date in the entry section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime 
X	  using the C locale  see guidelines for more info
X
X	 You may correctrevise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address  Be sure to set 'fix' in the 
X	  entry section to 'n'  The corrected entry must use the same 
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected  Be 
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the remark as well
X
X	 With the exception of the header all text outside of the above 
X	  format may be ignored by the judges  If you need tell the judges
X	  something put it in the remark section or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges
X
X	 Information from the author section will be published unless 
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line
X
X	 To credit multiple authors include an author section for
X	  each author  Each should start with author line and
X	  should be found between the entry and build sections
X
X	 The entry's remarks should include
X	     what this program does
X	     how to run the program sample args or input
X	     special compile or execution instructions if any
X	     special filename requirements see rule  and 
X	     information about any data files
X	     why you think the program is obfuscated
X	     note if this entry is a resubmission of a previous entry
X	     any other remarks humorous or otherwise
X
X	 Do not rot your entry's remarks  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be roted if your entry wins an award
X
X         Info files should be used only to supplement your entry  They 
X	  should not be required to exist
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file skip the info
X	  section  If your entry needs multiple info files use multiple 
X	  info sections one per info file  You should describe
X	  each info file in the remark section
X
X     If your entry is selected as a winner it will be modified as follows
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile and 'build' is removed
X	   'progc' is renamed to your entry's title followed by an optional
X	       digit followed by 'c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist state so in your
X       entry's remark section  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title possibly followed
X       by a digit followed by 'sh'
X
X       If needed your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames
X
X     The build file the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as readonly files  If your entry needs to modify these files
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file  If this
X       occurs state so in your entry's remarks
X
X     Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected
X       Use of common C KR  extensions is permitted as long as it does not 
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers
X
X     The program must be of original work  All programs must be in the
X       public domain  All copyrighted programs will be rejected
X
X     Entries must be received prior to May  UTC  UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time  Email your entries to
X
X		applepyramidsunuunethoptoadobfuscate
X		obfuscatetoadcom
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'
X
X       If possible we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until Mar  UTC  Early entries will be accepted however
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after Mar  UTC
X
X     Each person may submit up to  entries per contest year  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter
X
X    Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed  
X       Compiling an entry produce a file or files which may be executed
X
X    Programs that require special privileges setuid setgid superuser
X       special owner or group are not allowed

XABOUT THIS FILE
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest IOCCC for short
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about
X    them  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 
X
X    The entry format is better for us anyway  The program mkentryc
X    has been updated  See ENTRY FORMAT
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
X    fits are no longer permitted  Some of the new issues deal with 
X    nonintegral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor 
X    directives and the exit function  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry
X
X	 look at the original source
X	 convert ANSI trigraphs to ASCII
X	 C preprocess the source ignoring 'include' lines
X	 C preprocess the source ignoring 'define' and 'include' lines
X	 run it through a C beautifier
X	 examine the algorithm
X	 lint it
X	 compile it
X	 execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C preprocessor and a C beautifier
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests  In certain
X    cases a test is not important  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangestmost creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm  On the other hand given
X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules  As such we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation  As in real life
X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break  We are strict when it comes to the
X     byte size limit  Also abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year  Even so we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed if not smaller  
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly
X    in or near the final round  On the other hand we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that
X     is a prime number  If you do have a bug you are better off
X    documenting it  Noting this entry sometimes prints the th power
X    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry  And sometimes
X    a strange bugfeature can even help the entry  Of course a correctly
X    working entry is best
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES
X
X    Doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests
X    that we apply  Simply abusing defines or Dfoobar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we
X
X	define d define
X	d foo		    don't expect this to turn into define foo
X
X	int i
X	j		    don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler  If you 
X    must use nonANSI C such as KR C you must avoid areas that result in 
X    compilelink errors for ANSI C compilers
X
X    Unfortunately ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type
X    Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed
X
X	int i
X	char c
X	ic		    use ci instead
X	istring    use stringi instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments be careful Systems implement valist as a wide variety
X    of ways  Because of this a number of operations using valist are
X    not portable and must not be used
X
X	 assigning a nonvalist variable tofrom a valist variable
X	 casting a nonvalist variable intofrom a valist variable
X	 passing a valist variable to a function expecting a nonvalist arg
X	 passing a nonvalist variable to a function expecting a valist arg
X	 performing arithmetic on valist variables
X	 using valist as a structure or union
X
X    In particular do not treat valist variables as if they were a char 's
X
X    Avoid using varargsh use stdargh instead
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives define if ifdef 
X    the leading '' must be the first character on a line  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '' many do not
X
X    Because the exit function returns void on some systems entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do
X    serve a useful purpose  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand  For this reason we look for
X    programs that are compact and are instructional
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs say around 
X    bytes long  Getting close to  bytes is a bit too long in our opinion
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that
X
X	 are very hardware specific
X	 are very OS or Unx version specific
X	     indexstrchr differences are ok but socketstreams specific
X	      code is likely not to be
X	 dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item
X	 won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Unx
X	 abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	 obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI trigraphs
X	 are longer than they need to be
X	 are similar to previous winners
X	 are identical to previous losers  
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit  It is one thing to make use of a several D's to help out
X    but it is quite another to use  bytes of D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint
X
X    We allowed whitespace and in certain cases   or  do not impact
X    your program size up to a certain point because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters
X
X    Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob
X    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program we tend to favor the second version  Of course a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    andor obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest selfreplicating'
X    program  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest  There is nothing wrong with selfreplicating
X    programs  In fact a number of winners have been selfreplicating
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' lest we or others
X    know of a smaller one
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display  For example don't depend
X    on color or a given size  Don't require backing store
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set libXa libXawa libXmua and libXta
X    Don't use Mtif Xvew or OpenLok toolkits since not everyone
X    has them  Avoid depending on a particular window manager  Not
X    everyone has Xr and some people are stuck back in Xr or
X    earlier so try to target Xr without requiring Xr  Better
X    yet try to make your entry run on all version  X Window Systems
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    Xdefaults  If you must do so be sure to note the required lines
X    in the remark section
X
X    We like programs that
X
X	 are as concise and small as they need to be
X	 do something at least quasiinteresting
X	 pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice
X	 are portable
X	 are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	 MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	 make us laugh andor throw up  
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas  Of course your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several
X    areas really does help
X
X    We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in
X    the remark section helps your chance of winning  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well
X
X    Be creative
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way  This format
X    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself  see JUDGING PROCESS
X
X    We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to
X    format entries  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentryc
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules  In all cases
X	where this program differs from the contest rules the
X	contest rules will be used  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry  It is convenient however
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules
X
X    If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentryc program please send Email to the judges  see below
X
X    The following is a sample entry
X
Xentry
Xrule	
Xfix	n
Xtitle	chonglab
Xentry	
Xdate	Mon Mar    
Xhost	Unx v pdp
X	BSD pdp
Xremark
X    This is a nonobfuscated obfuscated C program
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize  But what do you expect from
X    a short example

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is progc
X    and will compile into prog  If an entry wins we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision  By tradition
X    we use the name of the entry's title followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award
X    we would use chonglabc and chonglab
X
X    If your entry depends on or requires that your build source
X    andor binary files be a particular name please say so in the
X    remark section  If this case applies it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following
X
X	 Tell us how to change the filenames in your entry
X
X	 Have the build file make copies of the files  For example
X
X		cc progc o specialname		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm f specialsrcc			need special source
X		cp progc specialsrcc
X		cc specialsrcc o specialname
X
X	    or  rm f specialbuild			need special build
X		tail  build  specialbuild
X		sh  specialbuild
X
X	 Assume that we will use the entry title  Send us a version of 
X	  your buildprogram files that uses the name convention  You 
X	  should uuencode these files in data sections
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files
X    please say so in the remark section  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build source and binary files  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify  This
X    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile  If the
X    build file must exist say so in the remark section
X
X    If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them
X    into info sections  In the case of multiple info files
X    use multiple info sections  If no info files are needed
X    then skip the info section
X
X    Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the remark section  For example an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry  For
X    example info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry  Because they are supplemental
X    the entry should not require them exist
X
X    In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts  If info files should not be renamed for some reason
X    say so in the remark section
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a subdirectory say
X    so in the remark section
X
X    When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from  to   Your first entry should
X    have entry number 
X
X    With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored  That is don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it  Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs If you need tell the the something put it in the 
X    remark section or send a Email to the judges at
X
X	applepyramidsunuunethoptoadjudges	not the address for
X	judgestoadcom					 submitting entries
X    
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC  Some systems refer 
X    to this as GMT or GMT  The format of the date should be that as 
X    returned by asctime in the C locale  An example of such a string is
X
X	Thr Apr   
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date command  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year  On many 
X    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string
X
X	date u a h d T y
X	date u  sed e 's '
X	sh c 'TZUTC date  sed e s '
X	sh c 'TZGMT date  sed e s '
X	sh c 'TZGMT date  sed e s '
X
X    You are allowed to updatefixrevise your entry  To do so set
X    the 'fix' line in the entry section to 'y' instead of 'n'
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files each containing
X
X	entry section
X	all author sections
X	all info sections
X	build section
X	program section
X	any other text including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly  Information from the
X    author sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete and then only from entries that have won an award
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased foragainst any one particular
X    individual  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end who won and where they were from
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced we make all
X    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion  We remove all nonwinning
X    files and shred all related paper  By tradition we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received  for the curious
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks
X
X    After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry  They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos  We
X    often accept their suggestionscomments about our remarks as well
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds  During a round
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles
X    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does
X    not  We also reexamine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round  Thus an entry gets at least two readings
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions
X
X	 reading the entry section
X	 reading the uudecoded build section
X	 reading the uudecoded program section
X	 reading the uudecoded info sections if any
X	 passing the source thru the C preprocessor
X	    shipping over any include files
X	 performing a number of C beautifycleanup edits on the source
X	 passing the beautified source thru the C preprocessor
X	    shipping over any include files
X
X    In later rounds other actions are performed
X
X	 linting the source
X	 compilingbuilding the source
X	 running the program
X	 performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about  entries entries
X    are judged on an individual basis  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round
X    When the number of entries thins to about  entries we begin to form
X    award categories  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards
X    An entry often will compete in several categories
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive  A typical category list might be
X
X	 best small one line program
X	 best small program
X	 strangestmost creative source layout
X	 most useful obfuscated program
X	 best game that is obfuscated
X	 most creatively obfuscated program
X	 most deceptive C code
X	 best X client see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES
X	 best abuse of ANSI C
X	 worst abuse of the rules
X	 anything else so strange that it deserves an award
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list  For example a few entries are so
X    goodbad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round
X    We will invent awards categories for them if necessary
X
X    In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries typically about  down to  or 
X    winners  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it  The selection of the winners out of the final round is
X    less clear cut
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out
X    by a similar but slightly better entry  For this reason it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry 
X    that failed to win in a previous year  This assumes of course 
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place
X
X    More often that not we select a small entry usually one line a
X    strangecreative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way
X
X    In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry  More often the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories

XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS
X
X    The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference  By tradition
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNETIOCCC BOF just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups
X
X	    complangc		  compunixwizards	altsources
X
X    In addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    compsourcesd	  altsourcesd		miscmisc
X	    compsourcesmisc	  compwindowsx
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives  See
X    below for details
X
X    Often winning entries are published in selected magazines  Winners 
X    have appeared in books The New Hackers Dictionary and on TShirts
X
X    Last but not least winners receive international fame and flames

X    
X	The original obfuscated contest
X
X    Obfuscate  trv  cated cating cates   a  To render obscure
X                b  To darken   To confuse  Their emotions obfuscated

X 
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST
X 
X         To write the most ObscureObfuscated C program under the rules below
X         To show the importance of programming style in an ironic way
X         To stress C compilers with unusual code
X         To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language
X         To provide a safe forum for poor C code  
X 
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests  Since
X     this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works
X    correctly is not sufficient  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language
X    see The New Hacker's Dictionary by Eric Raymond
X 
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries  The rules and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself change over time  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest  The typical 
X    closing date for contests are in early May
X 
X    The contest rules are posted to compunixwizards complangc
X    miscmisc altsources and compsourcesd  If you do not have access 
X    to these groups or if you missed the early March posting you may

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intelbased Unix with answers


I What options do I have for X software on my Intelbased Unix system

 Free options
	The BEST option is XFree which is an enhanced version of X 
	Any other version of X will have slower performance and will
	be more difficult to compile  Information on how to obtain XFree
	is listed below

	X is the port of the X server to System V that was
	done by Thomas Roell roellsgcscom
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards
	There are  major free versions X  is based on XR
	X  is included in MIT's XR distribution ie you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more
	X  is the current commercial offering from SGCS see below

II What is XFree and where do I get it

 What is XFree

   XFree is an enhanced version of X  which was distributed with
   XR  This release consists of many bug fixes speed improvements and
   other enhancements  Here are the highlights of the enhancements

     The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree
       selectable at runtime via the Xconfig file  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET based SVGA and others require a virtual screen width of
         The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default  With a highquality ET board VRAM this can yield
       up to  improvement of the xStones benchmark over X 
     The fX packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X b XR and approximately
        faster than X 
     Support for LOCALCONN compiletime selectable for server clients
       or both  This support is for both SVR and SVR  For SVR
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package' local connections from
       SCO XSightODT clients are supported
     Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGAC and TVGA SVGA chipsets
       Refer to the files READMEati and READMEtrident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers
     Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on exportlcsmitedu
     Type Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included and is
       compiletime selectable  There are contributed Type fonts in the
       contrib directory on exportlcsmitedu
     New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions
     Integrated support for BSD Mach and Linux
     A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree 
   they were not in XFree 

     The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bankswitching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to x 
       see the X manual page for more information
     Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server and with it the ability to support a two
       headed server  one VGA and one Hercules  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR it is also reported to work under Linux
     SVR shared libraries tested under ISC SVR  and 
     Support for SVR There are some special considerations to
       consider due to new USL bugs see the READMESVR file for
       more information
     Support for PS mice and Logitech MouseManTrackMan some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible
     A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data written by Eric Raymond derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation
     Greatly improved support for international keyboards including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers see the Xkeybd manual page for more 
       information
     The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
        MHz  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and reprobing using the new server
     Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive and more validation is done  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file see the X 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file

       Plus a number of other small things  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond and the
   current X mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat

 What OSs are supported

    XFree supports
	SVR Consensys V
	SVR Microport Dell Esix ISC ATT MST Consensys UHC
	SVR ISC    ATT 
	Linux Mach  BSD 

	BSD is not supported but it should work The most active
	BSD person is Greg Lehey groglemisde

	Note that Esix D and SCO are not supported yet
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches
	If you are interested in tackling this send mail to
	xfreephysicssuozau

 What video hardware is supported

   At this time XFree  supports the following SVGA chipsets

	Tseng ET
	Tseng ET
	Paradise PVGA
	Western Digital WDC WDC WDC these are supersets of
		the PVGA and use its driver
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGAC TVGA
	ATI  

	All of the above are supported in both  color and monochrome modes
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets which are only supported in
	 color mode

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards using k of
	video memory in a single bank and the Hercules card  On the
	ET only k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server and the GVGA has not been tested with more than k

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	nontraditional mechanisms for selecting pixelclock frequencies  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree
	 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered  Refer to the READMEclkprog file for information on how
	these programs work if you need to write one  If you do develop such
	a program the XFree team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree releases

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree
	it is suggested that you purchase an ETbased board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs  Avoid recent Diamond boards XFree will not
	work with them because Diamond won't provide programming details
	In fact the XFree project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products as long as such policies remain in effect  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted because of the potential liabilities
	If you would like to see this change tell Diamond about it

	Some people have asked if XFree would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards Theoretically the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree compatibility It
	could be ISA EISA or local bus  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card  Unfortunately the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines so this is largely an untested
	theory  However we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree
	working fine on them

 What about accelerated boards

	At this time there is no support in XFree for accelerated boards
	like the S ATI Ultra A TIGA etc  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink for SVR and SVR

	An S server is available for BSD and Linux  Contact
	hastynetcomcom for BSD or jonrobotsoxacuk for Linux

	A beta A server is available for Linux Contact martincsuncedu
	or jonrobotsoxacuk Note these servers are NOT part of XFree

 Why doesn't XFree support color VGA modes

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	color modes  In color modes each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains  pixel  But the color modes are implemented as bit
	planes  Each byte of frame buffer memory contains  bit from each
	of each of  pixels and there are four such planes  The MIT frame
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this  If VGA handled
	color modes by packing  bit pixels into each byte the MIT code
	could be modified to support this or it already may I'm not sure
	But for the VGA way of doing things a complete new framebuffer
	implementation is required  Some beta testers are looking into this
	but nothing is yet available from the project

 What other hardware or software requirements are there

	Obviously a supported SVGA board and OS are required  To run
	X efficiently MB of memory should be considered a minimum
	The various binary releases take MB of disk space depending
	on the OS eg whether or not it supports shared libraries
	To build from sources at least MB of free disk space will
	be required although MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound

 Where can I get source for XFree

	Source patches for the current version  based on XR PL
	from MIT are available via anonymous FTP from
		exportlcsmitedu under contribXFree
		ftpphysicssuozau under XFree
		ftpwintuenl under pubXFree
	For the rest of this FAQ these  location will be called FTP

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution

 Where can I get binaries for XFree

	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from
		ftpphysicssuozau		 SVR binaries
			under XFreeSVR
		ftpwintuenl			 SVR binaries
			under pubXFreeSVR
		ferkelucsbedu			 SVR binaries
			under pubSVRXFree
		stasibradleyedu		 SVR binaries
			under pubXFreeSVR
		blancmangemautexasedu	 SVR ISC binaries
			under pubISC
		ftpprztuberlinde             SVR ISC binaries
			under pubpciscXFree
		tsxmitedu			 Linux binaries
			under publinuxpackagesX
		agateberkeleyedu		 BSD binaries
			under pubBSDportsXFree
		ftpcsuwmedu			 Mach binaries
			under i

	Ensure that you are getting XFree   some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive and which compiletime option selections were
	made when building the distribution

IV What general things should I know about running XFree

 Installation directories

	The toplevel installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	usrX by default variable in configsitedef Binaries include
	files and libraries are installed in ProjectRootbinincludelib

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them This directory is
	nonstandard and was chosen this way to allow XFree to be installed
	alongside a commercialvendorsupplied X implementation

 Configuration files

	The XFree server reads a configuration file Xconfig on startup
	The search path contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage which should be consulted before asking questions

 Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat dwexmtgzfsattcom maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings
	The database is installed in usrXlibXetcmodeDBtxt and
	is in the source tree under mitserverddxxetc This database is
	also available from him for the latest copy and is kept on
	exportlcsmitedu in contribXmodeDBZ which is updated
	occasionally  Obtain a copy of this database  It just might have the
	settings you need  If you create new settings please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database

	If this doesn't help you the VideoModesdoc by Eric Raymond file 
	with XFree contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work and use
	this description to get them right  When you do send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database

	NOTE The old 'clockexe' program is not supported any more and
	      is completely unnecessary  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file if present and start the server  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file which is not necessary but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future

 Rebuildingreconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit

V What OSspecific things should I know about running XFree

	First of all the server must be installed suidroot mode 

 SVR
	Why won't my xterm run properly

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module you should define
	CONSEMno in you environment Otherwise xterm won't run
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch  is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap

 SVR

	Make sure you look at FTPREADMEISC if that's what you are running

 BSD

	Make sure you look at FTPREADMEBSD

	Also a separate BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	RichRiceedu  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFreeBSDFAQ at the following ftp sites

	    agateberkeleyedupubBSDportsXFree
	    wuarchivewustledumirrorsbsdportsXFree
	    graspunivlyonfrpubBSDportsXFree

 Linux

	You must be running Linux pl or greater and have the  gcc
	jump libraries installed

	Make sure the binaries X Xmono xload and xterm are setuid root

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in you'll have to
	run the server as X pn The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available If it is change the two files
	usrXbinstartx and usrXlibXxdmXservers removing the
	pn argument to X

	Make sure devconsole is either a link to devtty or has the major
	number  minor number  Also note that if devconsole is not
	owned by the user running X then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection Xdm will properly change the owner but
	startx won't

	When running xdm from rclocal you will need to provide it with
	a tty for example xdm  devconsole 

	For more detailed information please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsxmitedu

 Mach

	Make sure you look at FTPREADMEMach

VI What things should I know for building XFree from source

	This section has been removed from the FAQ since it is
	fully explained in FTPREADME and the OSspecific READMEs
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree

VII Is there anything special about building clients with XFree

 BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy etc
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsda
	which contains emulation for bcopy bzero bcmp ffs random
	seed A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	XXfuncsh in source files that call them  Xfuncsh provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions then you should link with libXbsda

 ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSIness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line  For example with stock MIT you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONSansi O fwritablestrings
	and to get rid of the ANSIness the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONSO fwritablestrings
	in his Imakefile  With this change you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONSansi
		CCOPTIONSO fwritablestrings
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is
		ANSICCOPTIONS
	to get rid of the ANSIness many X clients will die a horrible death
	with ansi  The effect is even more dramatic in practice because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONSANSICCOPTIONS' to a PassCDebugFlags definition

XFree Contact Information

    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree
    Core Team  At this time the Core Team consists of

	The original gang of four
		David Dawes dawesphysicssuozau
		Glenn Lai glenncsutexasedu

  Xt Glossary


o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code
  to allow useful graphical components to be created  Included with
  this are classes that provide the base functionality Object
  RectObj Core Composite Constraint Shell OverrideShell WMShell
  etc  The terms Xt and Intrinsics are used interchangeably
  however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X
  window system  In particular it does not include the Athena
  Motif OLIT or any other widget set  Without further widgets the
  Intrinsics are not especially useful

o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt  The
  precise use is any object that is a subclass of the Core class  It
  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless
  widgets or gadgets

o Xlib is the C interface to the X protocol  It is one layer below
  the Xt Intrinsics  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib
  functions because Xt provides most such services although an
  understanding of Xlib helps with problems

  Why does my application core dump when I use signalsalarmscthreads


In brief Xlib Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state  such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a
list traversal etc  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem
specific to Xlib and Xt the POSIX specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions

The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler  This flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback  It is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler  As another note it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes  This effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called  Another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop
about the read end using XtAppAddInput and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal
However this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up

Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem  Primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system   Is that a good enough reason  I don't think so

        Note the article in The X Journal  and the example in O'Reilly
Volume  are in error


  How do I use a different visual than the default


This requires a more complicated answer than it should  A window has
three things that are visual specific  the visual colormap and
border pixmap  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap
resource only shell widgets have Visual resources another questions
deals with why shells have a Visual  The default value of these
resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says  In the
shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen
and DefaultColormapOfScreen  When any one of the three resources is
not properly set a BadMatch error occurs when the window is
created  They are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used  

How to get this to work  There are two parts to the answer  The
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual  The second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available  The first is a
little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information


  Some sample code to start up an application using something other
  than the default visual
 
  To compile
 	cc g visualc o visual lXaw lXmu lXt lXext lX lm
 
  To run
 	visual geometry x depth  visual StaticColor fg blue bg yellow
 
  you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap

  Which visual should an application use


This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is
no way for an application to know the appropriate visual  it has to
be specified by the user  If you disagree with this then your
application probably falls into the category of always using the
default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular
visual such as bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension or some
such

Why  No application runs in isolation  Depending on the way a server
allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in
TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications  I may
be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor
or just monochrome

As an example on a low end color Sun server there are many different
possible visuals monochrome  entry colormap static gray static
color and a  TrueColor  The SGI Iris's offer all the above 
plus  bit TrueColor  bit TrueColor an Overlay Plane


  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual


This is strictly by convention  It makes it possible for an arbitrary
widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the
shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that
shell

A widget can have its own visual resource  If it does it must have
its own realize method to use the visual when it calls
XCreateWindow  You should also make this a resource that can be
obtained with XtGetValues so other widgets can find it  A
reasonable value is probably XtNvisual


  Which visual depth and colormap do Shells inherit


The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent  This
is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen DefaultDepthOfScreen
and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent  ie
it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree

If the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies
colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the
visual


  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error  Why


Some resource converters improperly cache references  This was
especially true of XR and earlier versions of Motif


  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget


See section  of the Xt specification

It eventually does get destroyed just not immediately  The
Intrinsics destroy a widget in a twophase process  First it and all
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed
It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed  This way any
pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned
up before the memory is actually freed  The second phase is then
performed after all callbacks event handlers and actions have
completed before checking for the next X event  At this point the
list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free'd among
other things

As some further caveatstrivia the widgets may be destroyed if the
Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the
widgets on the list  If so then the phase  destruction occurs
immediately  Also if nested event loops are used widgets placed on
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not
destroyed until returning to the outer event loop


 How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks


The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting
an application is used such as calling exit directly then a widget
may not have a chance to clean up any external state  such as open
sockets temporary files allocated X resources etc  this code for
simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget


	Widget
	ToplevelGet gw
		Widget		gw		 widget to find toplevel 
	
		Widget		top

		for top  gw XtParent top top  XtParent top
			 empty 
		return top
	

	void
	ExitCallback gw closure calldata
		Widget		gw		 widget 
		XtPointer	closure	 data the app specified 
		XtPointer	calldata	 widget specific data 
	
		Widget		toplevel

		toplevel  ToplevelGet gw
		XtUnmapWidget toplevel	 make it disappear quickly 
		XtDestroyWidget toplevel
		exit 
	

One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying
the toplevel widget  The trouble is the phase  destruction may never
occur  

This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work
for those widgets that have any external state  You might think that
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant
of the implementation details for each widget  Which means that the
widget may change and someday require that some external state is
cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks

One alternative is to modify ExitCallback to set a global flag and
then test for that flag in a private event loop  However private
event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and
difficult to maintain practices

Try the following code instead

	include XIntrinsich

	extern Widget ToplevelGet 
	if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw
	endif
	

	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc 
	if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		XtPointer	closure
	endif
	

	extern void ExitCallback 
	if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw
		XtPointer	closure
		XtPointer	calldata
	endif
	

	Widget
	ToplevelGet gw
	Widget		gw		 widget to find toplevel 
	
		Widget		top

		for top  gw XtParent top top  XtParent top
			 empty 
		return top
	


	void
	ExitCallback gw closure calldata
	Widget		gw		 widget 
	XtPointer	closure	 data the app specified 
	XtPointer	calldata	 widget specific data 
	
		Widget		toplevel

		toplevel  ToplevelGet gw
		XtUnmapWidget toplevel	 make it disappear quickly 
		XtDestroyWidget toplevel
		XtAppAddWorkProc XtWidgetToApplicationContext gw
				  ExitWorkProc XtPointer NULL
	

	Boolean
	ExitWorkProc closure
		XtPointer	closure
	
		exit 
		NOTREACHED
	


ExitCallback adds a work procedure that will get called when the
application is next idle  which happens after all the events are
processed and the destroy callbacks are executed


 How do I resize a Shell widget


After it is realized one doesn't resize a Shell widget  The proper
thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget
using XtSetValues  The geometry change is then propagated to the
Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the
request  However the Shell must have the resource
XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the
window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize

To change the position of a Shell use XtSetValues on the Shell not
the child and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted


 Why can't XtAppAddInput handle files


It does however Unix semantics for when IO is ready for a file does
not fit most peoples' intuitive model  In Unix terms a file
descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read call would not
block ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to
block  This works as expected for terminals sockets and pipes  For
a file the read will always return but the return indicates an EOF
 ie no more data  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always
calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to
be read  The culprit is the select system call or on SYSV based
OS's it is the poll system call

How to get around this on a Unix system  The best approach is to use
another process to check for available input on the file  Use a pipe
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file
descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput  A suitable program on
BSD systems is tail f filename

It's rumored that select on some systems is not completely
reliable  In particular

	 IBM AIX  this is one where it would work for a while
	  several thousand times and then stop until some other
	  event woke it up This seemed to be the result of a race
	  condition in the Kernel  IBM claims to have a fix for this

	 Pyramid doesn't work at all

	 Ultrix and possibly others where pipes are implemented as
	  sockets wasn't completely broken but although the writing
	  side wrote in  byte blocks the reading side received it
	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at
	  a time  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks
	  get raound it by detecting the situation and having
	  select ignore the pipe for  mseconds  by then it had
	  been given the whole block


Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as
read file descriptor pipes etc  This is an OS dependent area and
may not be identical on all systems  However the Intrinsic designers
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with
part of the toolkit  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this
point I don't know


 What good books and magazines are there on Xt


I have a favorite that is the definitive reference  To my perspective
it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full
details of the Intrinsics  When I started using it I was already
familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it so newcomers may or may
not find it useful  I've always found it accurate and complete which
means its a  pages

Asente Paul J and Swick Ralph R X Window System Toolkit The
	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification Digital Press
	 ISBN  order number EYEEDP and by
	PrenticeHall ISBN  Also available through DEC
	Direct at DIGITAL

The other book I commonly recomend to novices is

Young Doug The X Window System Applications and Programming with
	Xt Motif Version Prentice Hall  ISBN 
	ISBN 

And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt
O'Reilly ordering is   In particular Volume  is an Xt
reference done in manual page style  The rd edition is extensively
overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages  I'm finding it
very useful  In particular the permutted index and references to
other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related
information

I read two periodicals The X Resource and the The X Journal
These are the only two dealing specifically with X  The X Resource
is published quarterly by O'Reilly with one of the issues being the
MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings  There is no

The X Journal is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising
The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical
audience  I read it more to see what's going on then with an
expectation of learning a great deal but remember I represent a
fairly small percentage of people  Also they have a pretty good

 What Widgets are available


There are three popular widget sets

Athena	 The set provided with X  This is sufficient for most
	  purposes but is on the ugly side  Recently a d look is
	  available for ftp on exportlcsmiteducontribXawdtarZ
Motif	 From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on
	  many workstation vendors platforms almost everyone but
	  Sun  It looks good and works well but personally I think
	  it is poorly implemented
OLIT	 The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets
	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification  Developed by
	  ATT  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality
	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get

In addition the following collection of widgets are also available

Xtra	 a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software
	  Technology   It includes bar graph stacked
	  bar graph line graph pie chart xy plot hypertext help
	  spreadsheet and data entry form widgets  I've never seen
	  them so I can't comment
FWF	 The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of
	  freely available widgets  Included are a Pixmap editor
	  FileDialog and a few others  The current set of widgets
	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine
	  acsuiucedu  in the file pubfwfsharZ
Xcu	 The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes  One of the
	  early widget sets released  Provides a nice appearance for
	  buttons and has a mini command language  Probably not so
	  widely used
Xs	 The Sony widget set  This was around during R days but
	  seemed to disappear  It looked like it had promise
Xw	 The HP widgets  The precursor to Motif  Originally written
	  for R there exists diffs to get it to work under R  R
	  Again a pretty good widget set but has more or less died
	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was
	  originally implemented for XR and apparently provided
	  much experience for the designers of Xt
Xo	 A widget set I'm working on  It's still primitive but you
	  can give it a try in archivecisohiostateedupubXo

The following specialized widgets are also available

Tbl	 Implements a tabular layout of widgets  Supports Motif
	  widgets as children  Part of Wcl

 What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there


	
	Name		Language	Vendor
	
	Xview		C		Sun
	OI		C		ParcPlace
	Interviews	C		Stanford
	Tcltk		C		spriteberkeleyedu
	


However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and
implementing the Intrinsics hopefully some alternative will develop
in the next  years that uses an object oriented language  Keep
your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language
other than C starts gaining acceptance


 How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues


First what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is essentially
	typdef struct
		
	    String	name
	    long	value
	 Arg

and the code
	Arg	arg

	XtSetArg arg name 

expands to
	Arg	arg

	argname  name
	argvalue  

you can see that with normal C type conversions the argvalue
gets the integer  instead of the floating point value   When
the value is copied into the widget resource the bit pattern is
wildly different than that required for a floating point value  So
how to get around this

The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now
recomending it over the previous suggestions

define XtSetFloatArgarg n d 
    if sizeoffloat  sizeofXtArgVal  
        XtSetArgarg n d 
     else  
        XtArgVal ld  XtArgVal d 
        XtSetArgarg n ld 
    



 How do I write a resource converter


Courtesy of Rich Thomson rthomsondsdescom

The following discussion of resource converters assumes R or R
Intrinsics  Resource converters changed between R and R to allow
for destructors and caching of converted values

There are several main types of resource converters

    string to data type
    data type to string
    data type to data type

i string to data type
    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings
    that will be converted to data type values  This is most often
    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values

	Name		Value
	True		
	False		

    In this case the string to data type converter needs to compare
    the resource value to the list of fixed strings  This is most
    readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the
    resource manager  The resource value is turned into a quark
    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a
    single word  Then the resource quark is compared against the
    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values

    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter or many
    converters each with a small number of enumeration strings then
    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the
    resource strings into quarks  That way the first time one of
    these converters is used the strings will be turned into quarks
    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one
    of the converters

ii data type to string
    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data
    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary  Instead
    the data type value is simply converted to a string value
    probably by the use of sprintf

    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that
    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that
    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file  This
    mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state
    into a file  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to
    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms

    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type
    converter it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to
    string converter  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure
    that they are consistent

iii data type to data type
    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type
    value to another data type  For instance an X pixel value can be
    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for
    red green and blue


The type signature for a resource converter is as follows

typedef Boolean XtTypeConverterDisplay  XrmValuePtr Cardinal 
	XrmValuePtr XrmValuePtr XtPointer 
    Display dpy
    XrmValuePtr args
    Cardinal numargs
    XrmValuePtr fromVal
    XrmValuePtr toVal
    XtPointer converterdata

When the converter is invoked the fromVal argument points to the source
X resource manager value and the toVal argument points to the
destination X resource manager value  The converterdata argument
is an opaque pointer to some converterspecific data that is specified
when the converter is registered  The args and numargs arguments
allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is
invoked  For instance the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed
above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the
Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel

Care must be taken with the toVal argument  An XrmValue has the
following type definition and specifies a size and location for a
converted value

typedef struct 
    unsigned int    size
    caddrt         addr
 XrmValue XrmValuePtr

When the converter is invoked the address may point to a location of
the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL
In the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the
destination area is large enough to handle the converted value  If
the destination area is not large enough then the converter should
set the size to the amount of space needed and return False  The
caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the
converter  If the size is large enough then the converter can simply
copy the converted value into the space given and return True

If the location is NULL then the converter can assign the location to
the address of a static variable containing the converted value and
return True

When writing a group of converters this code is often repeated and it
becomes convenient to define a macro

    define DONEvar type 
      if toValaddr 
	 
	  if toValsize  sizeoftype 
	     
	      toValsize  sizeoftype 
	      return False 
	     
	  else 
	    type  toValaddr  var 
	 
      else 
	toValaddr  caddrt var 
      toValsize  sizeoftype 
      return True

    define DONESTRstr 
      if toValaddr  toValsize  sizeofString 
	 
	  toValsize  sizeofString 
	  return False 
	 
      else 
	toValaddr  caddrt str 
      toValsize  sizeofString 
      return True

Inside the converter it is a good idea to perform a little safety
checking on the numargs and args arguments to ensure that your
converter is being called properly

Once you have written your converter you need to register it with the
Intrinsics  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating
widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database

To register a converter with a single application context use
XtAppSetTypeConverter

void XtAppSetTypeConvertercontext from to converter args numargs
	cache destructor
    XtAppContext context
    String from
    String to
    XtTypeConverter converter
    XtConvertArgList args
    Cardinal numargs
    XtCacheType cache
    XtDestructor destructor

To register a converter with all application contexts use
XtSetTypeConverter

void XtSetTypeConverterfrom to converter args numargs
	cache destructor
    String from
    String to
    XtTypeConverter converter
    XtConvertArgList args
    Cardinal numargs
    XtCacheType cache
    XtDestructor destructor

In the R Intrinsics there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and
XtAddConverter these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter
and XtSetTypeConverter  Whenever possible the newer routines should be
used

When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics a cache argument
specifies how converted resource values are to be cached

    XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values
    XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values
    XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis

Caching converted values that require a roundtrip to the server is a
good idea for instance string to Pixel conversions

The destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the
resource is destroyed either because its cached reference count has
been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is
being destroyed  XtDestructor has the following type definition

typedef void XtDestructorXtAppContext XrmValuePtr XtPointer
	XrmValuePtr Cardinal 
    XtAppContext context
    XrmValuePtr to
    XtPointer converterdata
    XrmValuePtr args
    Cardinal numargs

The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated
with the to argument but does not actually free the storage pointed
to by the to argument itself toaddr  The destructor is passed
the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the
conversion was performed for instance colormap and visual arguments
for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to
free the allocated Pixel from the colormap as well as the private
data passed in when the converter was registered

Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT
R distribution

    mitlibXtConvertersc
    contriblibPEXtConvertersc
    contriblibPEXtConvertersh


 How do I open multiple displays


See Multiuser Application Software Using Xt The X Resource Issue 
Summer  by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues
involved  Most of this answer is based on that article  In a
nutshell one uses XtOpenDisplay to add each display to a single
application context and then XtCloseDisplay to shutdown each display
and remove it from the application context

The real problems occur when trying to close down a display  This can
happen  ways
	 User selects a quit button on one of the displays
	 User has window manager send a WMDELETEWINDOW message
	 Server disconnect  possibly from a KillClient message
	   server shutdowncrash or network failure

I'll assume you can deal gracefully with    since it is merely a
problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that
display  If not then read the Oliver Jones article

The third one is difficult to handle  The following is based on the
Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult
problem

The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an IO
error is always unrecoverable and so fatal  This is essentially true
for a single display X based application but not true for a
multiple display program or an application that does things other than
display information on an X server  When an X IO error occurs the
IO error handler is called and if it returns then an exit
happens  The only way around this is to use setjmplongjmp to avoid
returning to the IO error handler  The following code fragment
demonstrates this

include setjmph
jmpbuf XIOrecover

void
XIOHandler dpy
	Display		dpy

	destroyDisplay dpy
	longjmp XIOrecover 


main 

	
	if setjmp XIOrecover  
		XSetIOErrorHandler XIOHandler
	XtAppMainLoop appcontext


The destroyDisplay is something that given a Display pointer can go
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary
cleanup  It should also call XtCloseDisplay

For those of you unfamiliar with setjmplongjmp when setjmp is
first called it returns a  and save's enough information in the
jmpbuf that a latter execution of longjmp can return the program to
the same state as if the setjmp was just executed  The return value
of this second setjmp is the value of the second argument to
longjmp  There are several caveats about using these but for this
purpose it is adequate

Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that
improperly cache resources  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors
such as BadColor BadAtom or BadFont  There may be problems with the
total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited
number of file descriptors are available with  being a typical
value  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to
connect to a display

There was much discussion in compwindowsx about this topic in
November of   Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically
said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change

 Where are the resources loaded from


The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places
from highest priority to lowest priority

	 Args passed at creation time
	 Command line arguments
	 User's per host defaults file
	 User's defaults file
	 User's per application default file
	 System wide per application default file

Note that  are read only once on application startup  The result
of steps  is a single resource database used for further queries

The per host defaults file contains customizations for all
applications executing on a specific computer  This file is either
specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not
set then the file HOMEXdefaultshost is used

The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCEMANAGER
property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then
the file HOMEXdefaults is used  Typically the program xrdb is
used to set the RESOURCEMANAGER property  Please note that this
should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the
display must transfer the property  A size of around KByte is
reasonable  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCEMANAGER
but most do not

A user may have many per application default files containing
customizations specific to each application  The intrinsics are quite
flexible on how this file is found  Read the next part that describes
the various environment variables and how they effect where this file
is found

The system wide per application default files are typically found in
usrlibXappdefaults  If such a file is not found then the
fallback resources are used  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how
this file is found  Read the next part that describes the various
environment variables and how they effect where this file is found

Thanks to Oliver Jones ojpictelcom for the following 

You can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your Xtbased programs  XFILESEARCHPATH
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR  These environment variables
control where Xt looks for applicationdefaults files as an
application is initializing  Xt loads at most one appdefaults file
from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path
defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a
way that appdefaults files appear in several different directory
hierarchies  Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open
Windows and you also have some R X applications installed in
usrlibXappdefaults You could set a value like this for
XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up appdefaults files
in both usrlibX and usropenwinlib or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located

	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH usrlibXTNOPENWINHOMElibTN

The value of this environment variable is a colonseparated list of
pathnames  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows
see XtResolvePathname

	N	The value of the filename parameter or the
		application's class name
	T	The value of the file type  In this case the
		literal string appdefaults
	C	customization resource R only
	S	Suffix  None for appdefaults
	L	Language locale and codeset eg jaJPEUC
	l	Language part of L  eg ja
	t	The territory part of the display's language string
	c	The codeset part of the display's language string

Let's take apart the example  Suppose the application's class name is
Myterm Also suppose Open Windows is installed in usropenwin
Notice the example omits localespecific lookup

	usrlibXTN        means usrlibXappdefaultsMyterm
	OPENWINHOMElibTN    means usropenwinlibappdefaultsMyterm

As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above
appdefaults files in the order shown  As soon as it finds one it
reads it and uses it and stops looking for others  The effect of
this path is to search first in usrlibX then in usropenwin

Let's consider another example This time let's set
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Mytermad in the current
working directory then for Myterm in the directory appdefaults

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH NadHOMEappdefaultsN

The first path in the list expands to Mytermad  The second expands
to HOMEappdefaultsMyterm  This is a convenient setting for
debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the
appdefaults file Mytermad in the application's source directory so
you can run the application from the directory in which you are
working and still have the resources loaded properly

NOTE when looking for appdefault files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
      for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is
      defined so T and S are useless

With R there's another twist  You may specify a customization
resource value  For example you might run the myterm application
like this

	myterm xrm customization color

If one of your pathname specifications had the value
usrlibXappdefaultsNC then the expanded pathname would be
usrlibXappdefaultsMytermcolor because the C substitution
character takes on the value of the customization resource

The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is

		usrlibXLTNC  R
		usrlibXlTNC  R
		usrlibXTNC     R
		usrlibXLTN
		usrlibXlTN
		usrlibXTN

Note some sites replace usrlibX with a ProjectRoot in this
batch of default settings

The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is 

		rootLNC  R
		rootlNC  R
		rootNC     R
		rootLN
		rootlN
		rootN

root is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some
value other than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether

Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your appdefaults file in your current working directory is to set
XAPPLRESDIR to  a single dot  In R all this machinery worked
differently for R compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR
value to  a dot followed by a slash



 What order are callbacks executed in

Courtesy of Donna Converse converseexpolcsmitedu 

The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order  This is because
both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to
modify the entire contents of the callback list  Neither one
currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot
guarantee the order of execution

The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer the
widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and
remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have
therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be
independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the
list

Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback
says

 	callbackname Specifies the callback list to which the
 	procedure is to be appended
 
you may not infer from the word appended that the callback routines
are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback
list


 How do I know if a widget is visible

Courtesy of Donna Converse converseexpolcsmitedu 

 I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible I set the visible
 interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured the Core
 visible flag goes FALSE However if my window is iconified the flag
 stays set to TRUE

Right everything is implemented correctly  This demonstrates a deficiency
in the X protocol and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the
protocol  The deficiency is that the information is available in one way
in this case an inconvenient way  The Xt specification is accurate in
the second and third paragraphs of section  so read this section
carefully  The visible field will not change in response to iconification

A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from
viewable to unviewable that is when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped
that is when iconification occurs  This is the protocol deficiency
Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol
see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual

 Is this a problem with mwm or is there something
 else which needs to be done

You'll see this with any window manager with no window manager

 If the problem is mwm what is the fastest
 way to determine if a window is iconified 

As an application writer keep track with a global Boolean in an action
routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget
which contains your custom widget  As the custom widget writer see the
mapstate field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes  These are
suggestions


 How do I reparent a widget in Xt ie XtReparentWidget

 Why use XtMalloc XtFree etc


Unfortunately most code that calls malloc realloc or calloc
tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL  At best it is
handled something like

	ptr  type  malloc sizeof type
	if ptr
	
		perror malloc in xyzzy
		exit 
	
To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions
XtMalloc XtCalloc XtNew XtNewString and XtRealloc which
all use the standard C language functions malloc calloc and
realloc but execute XtErrorMsg if a NULL value is returned  Xt
error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits

In addition if XtRealloc is called with a NULL pointer it uses
XtMalloc to get the initial space  This allows code like

	if ptr
		ptr  type  malloc sizeof type
	else
		ptr  type  realloc ptr sizeof type  count  
	count

to be written as

	ptr  XtRealloc ptr sizeof ptr  count

Also XtFree accepts a NULL pointer as an argument  Generally I've
found the Xt functions conveniant to use  However anytime I'm
allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so
I can fully recover from not enough memory errors

XtNew and XtNewString are conveniant macros for allocating a
structure or copying a string

	  struct abc xyzzy
	  char	     ptr
	  char	     str  abcdef

	  xyzzy  XtNew struct abc	 takes care of type casting 
	  ptr  XtNewString str

A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an
implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with
malloc and free  Ie code such as

	 char	      ptr

	 ptr  XtMalloc 
	   
	 free ptr

may not work  Personally I'd call any implementation that did this
broken and complain to the vendor

A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree on a string
when they should really be using XmStringFree


 How to debug an Xt application

First I'd recomend getting purify from Pure Software  This is a
great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's  It's a bit pricey
at  but I'd still recomend it  Excuse the marketing blurb
contact supportpurecom for more info

	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into
	the object code produced by existing compilers  These
	instructions check every memory read and write performed by
	the program under test and detect several types of access
	errors such as reading unitialized memory writing past
	malloc'd bounds or writing to freed memory  Purify inserts
	checking logic into all of the code in a program including
	third party and vendor objectcode libraries and verifies
	system call interfaces  In addition Purify tracks memory
	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel
	adaption of garbage collection techniques  Purify's nearly
	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program
	down typically by a factor of two to five

An alternative package that isn't as pricey  for a Sun runs on
many Unix's and has pretty similar features is The SENTINEL Debugging
Environment  This replaces malloc and several other C library
functions to add additional checks  contact cpcahilvirtechvticom
for more info

Next if you are getting any sort of Xlib error you'll need to run in
synchronous mode easily accomplished with the sync command line
argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to  with your debugger  Then
set a break point in exit  This will let you trace back to the
original Xlib function being called  If you don't run in synchronous
mode then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to
Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the
server are asynchronous

Next if you are having trouble with window layout you can use the
undocumented resource xtIdentifyWindows or the class resource
XtDebug to cause the widget name to be identified with each window
For example

    example xload xrm 'XtDebugtrue' 
    example xwininfo tree
	     click in new xload window

will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each
window is included  This can help for checking the location and size
of errant widgets

Next if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to
test the way a widget manages it's children you can try
exportlcsmiteducontriblibXtGeotarZ  This acts as a filter
between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour
of both  It's a very clever idea

The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the
application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse such as from
a pulldown menu  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to
go to another machine and kill the debugger manually  The server
locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped
waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands
Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to
your application which is stopped

The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on
your desk running the program under a debugger or other environment
on one machine and running the application on the other possibly
using a command sequence like this

	othermachine xhost thismachine
	thismachine setenv DISPLAY othermachine
	thismachine gdb application	 Your favorite debugger
	or this
	othermachine xhost thismachine
	thismachine gdb application
	gdb set environment DISPLAY othermachine
	gdb run 

I believe CodeCenter a C interpretergraphical debugger has a method
of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to
release any grabs during breakpoints

Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and
knowledge of how widgets work  You can go a long way without knowing
the internals of a particular widget but not very far without
understanding how a widget works  Judicious use of conditional
breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great
deal


 Why don't XtAddInput XtAddTimeout and XtAddWorkProc work

   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput
   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc The problem I have is that when
   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly
   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works
   perfect but in my real application nothing happens 

The introduction in R of the XtApp functions obsoleted those
routines see Q for other changes in R R and R  What happens is
they use a default application context different then the one you may
have created  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per
application context basis and you are using two application contexts
you won't get those events

For example

	
	cnt  
	toplevel  XtAppInitializeapp class
				   Desc XtNumber Desc
				   argc argv
				   Fallback args cnt

	XtAddTimeOut 
	XtAddWorkProc 

	XtAppMainLoop app

would never invoke the timeout


 What is and how can I implement drag and drop

Courtesy of Roger Reynolds rogerrnetcomcom  Feb 

Dragndrop is a buzzword for moving data between clients in an
intuitive'' fashion

Motif Version  supports dragndrop capabilities OpenLook has
supported dnd all along  The two protocols are not compatable with
each other and so far as I know they are not published

I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public
protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients  My
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to
support a standard dragndrop protocol in the programs they develop
and contribute or sell regardless of what widget set is used as long
as it is based on Xt

The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM
conventions for more details read the code

I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that
it works a whole lot better than Motif  stuff  Also there seem to
be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif
anyway

The latest RDD and some other stuff is available for ftp from
netcomcom in pubrogerr  A possibly older version is also
available on exportlcsmitedu in contrib

I don't know a great deal about the support for C in UIMX but I can tell 
you that there is good support for it in TeleUSE  In TeleUSE you can call any
C method from a D module  What you can do then is to use the D language
for most of your interface code and then use C for you application code

I should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of TeleUSE soon
in regard to C but I can't give you many details  You should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture

If you want example code of how C integrates with TeleUSE you should look at

Hi 

I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine and I'm
observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a
DrawingArea Namely some Xlib operations work and some do not In
particular the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some
XDrawPoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing
whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is clicked on and moved in the
rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on
some part of the drawing area This also happens less consistently when the
pulldownpopup is moved in the leftward direction

Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server
bug

Thanks

is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently
controlled by xdm login screen   I've been through the manuals
and FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable'

I have looked through the FAQ sections and have not
seen a answer for this

I have an XMotif application that I have written
I have a couple of gif files or pict that I have
scanned in with a color scanner  Now I would like
to be able to convert the gif files into a format
that could be read into my application and displayed
on the background of its main window Preferably with
pixmaps or perhaps as an XImage

I have found functions in the pbmplus program suite
to convert gif to xbm but that is monochrome and
I really do need color

I have looked at xv which reads in gif and writes
out several formats but have not found a way to write
out a file which can be read in as a pixmap

Is there an easy way to do this

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups  Sorry for the cross posting

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines
See the diff marks at the right hand edge  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the  IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes

Xanon	y or n   y  remain anonymous n  ok to publish this info
Xinfo
XIf your program needs an info file place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section  In the case of multiple info files use multiple info
Xsections  If your entry does not need a info file skip this section
Xbuild
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the commands used to compilebuild your program
Xin this section  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'  The resulting
Xfile must be  bytes or less
Xprogram
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'progc'  The resulting file must follow rule 
Xend
X
X      Regarding the above format
X
X	 The title must match the expression azAZazAZ
X	  and must be  to  characters in length
X
X	  It is suggested but not required that the title should
X	  incorporate your username in the case of multiple authors
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors
X
X	 The date in the entry section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime
X	  using the C locale  see guidelines for more info
X
X	 You may correctrevise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address  Be sure to set 'fix' in the
X	  entry section to 'n'  The corrected entry must use the same
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected  Be
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the remark as well
X
X	 With the exception of the header all text outside of the above
X	  format may be ignored by the judges  If you need tell the judges
X	  something put it in the remark section or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges
X
X	 Information from the author section will be published unless
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line
X
X	 To credit multiple authors include an author section for
X	  each author  Each should start with author line and
X	  should be found between the entry and build sections
X
X	 The entry's remarks should include
X	     what this program does
X	     how to run the program sample args or input
X	     special compile or execution instructions if any
X	     special filename requirements see rule  and 
X	     information about any data files
X	     why you think the program is obfuscated

X	     any other remarks humorous or otherwise
X
X	 Do not rot your entry's remarks  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be roted if your entry wins an award
X
X         Info files should be used only to supplement your entry  They
X	  should not be required to exist
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file skip the info
X	  section  If your entry needs multiple info files use multiple
X	  info sections one per info file  You should describe
X	  each info file in the remark section
X
X     If your entry is selected as a winner it will be modified as follows
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile and 'build' is removed
X	   'progc' is renamed to your entry's title followed by an optional
X	       digit followed by 'c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist state so in your
X       entry's remark section  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title possibly followed
X       by a digit followed by 'sh'
X
X       If needed your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames
X
X     The build file the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as readonly files  If your entry needs to modify these files
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file  If this
X       occurs state so in your entry's remarks
X
X     Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected

XABOUT THIS FILE
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest IOCCC for short
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about
X    them  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed  Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines
X
X    Changes from the  draft are noted by change bars  		      
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 
X
X    The entry format is better for us anyway  The program mkentryc
X    has been updated  See ENTRY FORMAT
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers
X    fits are no longer permitted  Some of the new issues deal with
X    nonintegral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor
X    directives and the exit function  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry
X
X	 look at the original source
X	 convert ANSI trigraphs to ASCII
X	 C preprocess the source ignoring 'include' lines
X	 C preprocess the source ignoring 'define' and 'include' lines
X	 run it through a C beautifier
X	 examine the algorithm
X	 lint it
X	 compile it
X	 execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C preprocessor and a C beautifier
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests  In certain
X    cases a test is not important  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangestmost creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm  On the other hand given
X    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules  As such we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation  As in real life
X    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important  For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break  We are strict when it comes to the
X     byte size limit  Also abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year  Even so we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed if not smaller  
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly
X    in or near the final round  On the other hand we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that
X     is a prime number  If you do have a bug you are better off
X    documenting it  Noting this entry sometimes prints the th power
X    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry  And sometimes
X    a strange bugfeature can even help the entry  Of course a correctly
X    working entry is best
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES
X
X    Doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests
X    that we apply  Simply abusing defines or Dfoobar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we
X
X	define d define
X	d foo		    don't expect this to turn into define foo
X
X	int i
X	j		    don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler  If you
X    must use nonANSI C such as KR C you must avoid areas that result in
X    compilelink errors for ANSI C compilers
X
X    Unfortunately some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       
X    integral type  Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should    
X    not be used in   This rule may be relaxed in future contests	      
X
X	int i
X	char c
X	ic		    use ci instead
X	istring    use stringi instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments be careful Systems implement valist as a wide variety
X    of ways  Because of this a number of operations using valist are
X    not portable and must not be used
X
X	 assigning a nonvalist variable tofrom a valist variable
X	 casting a nonvalist variable intofrom a valist variable
X	 passing a valist variable to a function expecting a nonvalist arg
X	 passing a nonvalist variable to a function expecting a valist arg
X	 performing arithmetic on valist variables
X	 using valist as a structure or union
X
X    In particular do not treat valist variables as if they were a char 's
X
X    Avoid using varargsh use stdargh instead
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives define if ifdef 
X    the leading '' must be the first character on a line  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '' many do not
X
X    Because the exit function returns void on some systems entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do
X    serve a useful purpose  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand  For this reason we look for
X    programs that are compact and are instructional
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs say around 
X    bytes long  Getting close to  bytes is a bit too long in our opinion
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that
X
X	 are very hardware specific
X	 are very OS or Unx version specific
X	     indexstrchr differences are ok but socketstreams specific
X	      code is likely not to be
X	 dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item
X	 won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Unx
X	 abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	 obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI trigraphs
X	 are longer than they need to be
X	 are similar to previous winners
X	 are identical to previous losers  
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit  It is one thing to make use of a several D's to help out
X    but it is quite another to use  bytes of D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint
X
X    We allowed whitespace and in certain cases   or  do not impact
X    your program size up to a certain point because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters
X
X    Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob
X    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program we tend to favor the second version  Of course a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    andor obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest selfreplicating'
X    program  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest  There is nothing wrong with selfreplicating
X    programs  In fact a number of winners have been selfreplicating
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' lest we or others
X    know of a smaller one
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display  For example don't depend
X    on color or a given size  Don't require backing store
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set libXa libXawa libXmua and libXta
X    Don't use Mtif Xvew or OpenLok toolkits since not everyone
X    has them  Avoid depending on a particular window manager  Not
X    everyone has Xr and some people are stuck back in Xr or
X    earlier so try to target Xr without requiring Xr  Better
X    yet try to make your entry run on all version  X Window Systems
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    Xdefaults  If you must do so be sure to note the required lines
X    in the remark section
X
X    We like programs that
X
X	 are as concise and small as they need to be
X	 do something at least quasiinteresting
X	 pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice
X	 are portable
X	 are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	 MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	 make us laugh andor throw up  
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas  Of course your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several
X    areas really does help
X
X    We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in
X    the remark section helps your chance of winning  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well
X
X    Be creative
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way  This format
X    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself  see JUDGING PROCESS
X
X    We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to
X    format entries  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentryc
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules  In all cases
X	where this program differs from the contest rules the
X	contest rules will be used  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry  It is convenient however
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules
X
X    If you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentryc program please send Email to the judges  see below
X
X    The following is a sample entry
X
Xentry
Xrule	
Xfix	n
Xtitle	chonglab
Xentry	
Xdate	Mon Mar    
Xhost	Unx v pdp
X	BSD pdp
Xremark
X    This is a nonobfuscated obfuscated C program
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize  But what do you expect from
X    a short example

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is progc
X    and will compile into prog  If an entry wins we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision  By tradition
X    we use the name of the entry's title followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award
X    we would use chonglabc and chonglab
X
X    If your entry depends on or requires that your build source
X    andor binary files be a particular name please say so in the
X    remark section  If this case applies it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following
X
X	 Tell us how to change the filenames in your entry
X
X	 Have the build file make copies of the files  For example
X
X		cc progc o specialname		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm f specialsrcc			need special source
X		cp progc specialsrcc
X		cc specialsrcc o specialname
X
X	    or  rm f specialbuild			need special build
X		tail  build  specialbuild
X		sh  specialbuild
X
X	 Assume that we will use the entry title  Send us a version of
X	  your buildprogram files that uses the name convention  You
X	  should uuencode these files in data sections
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files
X    please say so in the remark section  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build source and binary files  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify  This
X    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile  If the
X    build file must exist say so in the remark section
X
X    If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them
X    into info sections  In the case of multiple info files
X    use multiple info sections  If no info files are needed
X    then skip the info section
X
X    Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the remark section  For example an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry  For
X    example info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry  Because they are supplemental
X    the entry should not require them exist
X
X    In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts  If info files should not be renamed for some reason
X    say so in the remark section
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a subdirectory say
X    so in the remark section
X
X    When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from  to   Your first entry should
X    have entry number 
X
X    With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored  That is don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it  Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs If you need tell the the something put it in the
X    remark section or send a Email to the judges at
X
X	applepyramidsunuunethoptoadjudges	not the address for
X	judgestoadcom					 submitting entries
X
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC  Some systems refer
X    to this as GMT or GMT  The format of the date should be that as
X    returned by asctime in the C locale  An example of such a string is
X
X	Thr Apr   
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date command  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year  On many
X    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string
X
X	date u a h d T y
X	date u  sed e 's '
X	sh c 'TZUTC date  sed e s '
X	sh c 'TZGMT date  sed e s '
X	sh c 'TZGMT date  sed e s '
X
X    You are allowed to updatefixrevise your entry  To do so set
X    the 'fix' line in the entry section to 'y' instead of 'n'
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files each containing
X
X	entry section
X	all author sections
X	all info sections
X	build section
X	program section
X	any other text including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly  Information from the
X    author sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete and then only from entries that have won an award
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased foragainst any one particular
X    individual  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end who won and where they were from
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced we make all
X    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion  We remove all nonwinning
X    files and shred all related paper  By tradition we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received  for the curious
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks
X
X    After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry  They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos  We
X    often accept their suggestionscomments about our remarks as well
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds  During a round
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles
X    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does
X    not  We also reexamine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round  Thus an entry gets at least two readings
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions
X
X	 reading the entry section
X	 reading the uudecoded build section
X	 reading the uudecoded program section
X	 reading the uudecoded info sections if any
X	 passing the source thru the C preprocessor
X	    shipping over any include files
X	 performing a number of C beautifycleanup edits on the source
X	 passing the beautified source thru the C preprocessor
X	    shipping over any include files
X
X    In later rounds other actions are performed
X
X	 linting the source
X	 compilingbuilding the source
X	 running the program
X	 performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about  entries entries
X    are judged on an individual basis  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round
X    When the number of entries thins to about  entries we begin to form
X    award categories  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards
X    An entry often will compete in several categories
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive  A typical category list might be
X
X	 best small one line program
X	 best small program
X	 strangestmost creative source layout
X	 most useful obfuscated program
X	 best game that is obfuscated
X	 most creatively obfuscated program
X	 most deceptive C code
X	 best X client see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES
X	 best abuse of ANSI C
X	 worst abuse of the rules
X	 anything else so strange that it deserves an award
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list  For example a few entries are so
X    goodbad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round
X    We will invent awards categories for them if necessary
X
X    In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries typically about  down to  or 
X    winners  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it  The selection of the winners out of the final round is
X    less clear cut
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out
X    by a similar but slightly better entry  For this reason it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry
X    that failed to win in a previous year  This assumes of course
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place
X
X    More often that not we select a small entry usually one line a
X    strangecreative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way
X
X    In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry  More often the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS
X
X    The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference  By tradition
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNETIOCCC BOF just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups
X
X	    complangc		  compunixwizards	altsources
X
X    In addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    compsourcesd	  altsourcesd		miscmisc
X	    compsourcesmisc	  compwindowsx
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives  See
X    below for details
X
X    Often winning entries are published in selected magazines  Winners
X    have appeared in books The New Hackers Dictionary and on TShirts
X
X    Last but not least winners receive international fame and flames

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups  Sorry for the cross posting

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines
See the diff marks at the right hand edge  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the  IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes

I might have a need in the future to display rotated text  I noticed the

problem  The API to it assumes you have a font name not an already loaded
font  It shouldn't be too difficult to split up the function into two
interface routines one with a font name and one with an XFontStruct but
I thought I would ask the author Alan Richardson
mppaukacsussexsyma first in case he was planning this already
Unfortunately his email address bounced  Does Alan R or the current

  Motif managers take a very simplistic approach to the way they handle events 
  for gadgets they track for all eventssuch as Motion Notify wether or not 
  the gadget expresses interest in the events As a result gadgets typically
  generate a great deal more network traffic  Those with X terminals might find 
  a noticable network performance drop as a result
  
  Really  What's the point using Gadgets then
 
 It is a case of memory vs network performance tradeoff  Gadgets
 save both client and server memory  But memory is easily expandable while
 network performance is not so if I were designing Motif I would
 at least make it possible to avoid using gadgets  At present you
 really don't have a choice because Motif forces you to use gadgets
 in menus and in various other places

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I
noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets perhaps
even  faster  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
were no longer any benefit to performance and that it's just as well
to use widgets everywhere  So why would  pushbutton gadgets be a lot
quicker than  pushbuttons in the graph  Should I start putting gadgets
back into my long pulldown menus 

XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network
type graph with automatic layout capability

There's a bug in SunOS  which is alluded to in the FAQ although
there it's talking about XR as being affected  You need to force
libXmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works
around the linker error  The simplest thing to do is edit each of
the Makefiles where there's a failure and change the line which reads
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC lXmu
to
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic

No This is only relevant for OpenWindows x as shipped with SunOS
It is not relevant for MIT R MIT R should compile without problems

I have been building X with gcc since  and the only time I had
trouble was when the position independant code option broke so I
couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries The important thing to
do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release Gcc generates code
that requires libgcc and you should take that into account when
deciding which compiler to use for the libraries

I would like to know your experiences with using DESQviewX to run an

 Does anyone have any good ideas on how to integrate C code elegantly
 with TeleUse UIMX  Interface Architect generated code
 
 Source would be great but any suggestions are welcome

It's my understanding that the next release of UIMX due out
last February  has full support for C

I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages
of these other tools but does fully support C code generation
reusable templates via C classes which are generated a variety of
other handy features for using C and layout functions in different
ways and generates Motif  code including drag 'n drop 
internationalization etc  Fits in quite nicely with Doug Young's
paradigm for CMotif

You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap
XtNcolormap for truly literate beings not being set  What you want
to do is start your application with your new colormap  This can be a
chicken and egg sort of problem however  If you look at the Xt FAQ
there is an example that should show how it can be done  If not let
me know and maybe I can improve the example

They aren't functions they are character arrays The standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES Your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other It is probably worth
adding DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS

I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell
repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell If it is
run more than once on a display the tones are buffered in the X
server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program
have exited Is there a convenient way of preventing this eg by
emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits

   In my opinion a programming degree is still worth having

 Yes but a CS degree is not a programming degree Does anybody know of
a computing course where programming is taught  Computer Science is
a branch of maths or the course I did was
 I've also done a Software Engineering course  much more practical and likely
to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think
they want but also did not teach programming The ability to program was
an entry requirement

At Robert Gordon University programming was the main most timeconsuming 
start of the course The first two years consisted of five subjects
Software Engineering PascalCUNIX Computer Engineering  
assembler Computer Theory LISPProlog MathematicsStatistics and 
Communication Skills How to pass interviewsintelligence tests and group
discussions eg How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea
The third year Industrial placement was spent working for a computer company 
for a year The company could be anywhere in Europe there was a special 
Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors  
The fourth year included Operating SystemsCModula Software Engineering 
C assembler Real Time Laboratory C assembler and Computing 
Theory LISP  There were also Group Projects in nd and th Years where 
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an 
outside company the only disadvantage being that specifications would change 
suddenly
 
In the first four years there was a  weighting between courseworks and 
exams for most subjects However in the Honours year this was reduced to a 
 split between an Individual Project and final exams no coursework 
assessment  are all Computer Science courses like this

BTW  we started off with  students in our first year and were left with  by
Honours year Also every course is tutored separately Not easy trying
to sleep when you are in  student class

Subject    TOPIC BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION topic needs updating to R

Subject    What's a good source of information on configuring the X build

	This FAQ includes information on a number of gotchas that can bite 
you on particular system However the best source of general information on 
building the X release is found in the Release Notes The file is bundled 
separately from the rest of the release so if it's become separated from your 
sources you can FTP another copy separately the file RELNOTESmsPSTXT at 
the top of the distribution The file RELNOTES is also available from the 
xstuff mail server
	In addition O'Reilly  Associates's Volume  on X Administration
includes information on configuring and building X


Subject    Why doesn't my Sun with a cg work with R

	Apparently gcc is the problem it seems to produce fine code for all
Sun displays except for the cgsix The new sunGXo distributed with fix 
may fix the problem note not known to work on Solaris


Subject    Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS  know about dlsym etc

	If you get errors with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined link with 
libdla  Add ldl to your and eventually your sitedef  You may want to 
surround it with Bstatic ldl Bdynamic if you add it to the EXTRALIBRARIES
variable since syslibs get added after EXTRALIBRARIES on the eventual 
compilation command otherwise you may not have a shared libdl  Or compile 
the stubs shared

Subject    What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 

	In SunOS  Sun fixed a sharedlibrary bug in ld which conflicts
with the way XR builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols to be
undefined when building some X clients 
	getwmShellWidgetClass
	getapplicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic appears to work 

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows  XRbased Xt please 
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches

Patch id      Description
       x OpenWindows  libXt Jumbo patch
       x OpenWindows  undefined symbols when using
                        shared libXmu

A source patch for use with the MIT XR libraries was developed by Conrad 
Kimball ceksdcboeingcom it retrofits into R some fixes made in R to
get around this problem The patch is on export in

Subject    Why can't gcc compile XR on my SPARC
I used gcc to compile the whole distribution but I get several segmentation
faults when running X

	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
x or VAX platforms

	Here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when 
gcccompiled parts of X are linked with Sunsupplied functions that pass or 
return structs runtime errors occur  Affected programs include rgb and 
the server

	This is from the GCC manual

	On the Sparc GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures  It passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference

	This really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in GNU CC so it isn't straightforward to fix it

	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible and
	fpccstructreturn' does not help

You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags  

	Files which need to be compiled using cc include
		serverosbsdoscolorc 
		rgbrgbc

	In addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or
return values  
		clientsxhostxhostc 
		clientsxauthgethostc 
Calls to inetaddr in libCLXsocketc and libXXConnDisc are possibly 
harmless as they don't involve structs

Subject    What are these IO errors running X built with gcc
When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error 
	Getting interface configuration Operation not supported on socket 
	Fatal server bug no screens found

	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work You can do 
this simple test

	include sysioctlh
	SIOCGIFCONF

Run that through cc E and gcc E  The last line of output is the piece of 
interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i' your 
fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other go back to your gcc
sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the X distribution If they are 
identical try running a make clean in mitserver and rebuilding just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files

Subject    What are these problems compiling XR on the older Sun
In mitserverddxsunsunCGCc we have found missing defines for 
CGACMONOLEN CGBCMONOLEN CGACENBLEN CGBCENBLEN What should these be

	The R Errata list distributed after XR mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older SunOS versions eg  to compile
        define CGACMONOLEN 
        define CGACENBLEN  CGACMONOLEN
        define CGBCMONOLEN CGACMONOLEN
        define CGBCENBLEN  CGACMONOLEN

	However the Sun should not actually ever have the CG device and so 
references to it can be removed from mitserverddxsunsunInitc and the 
Imakefile  


Subject   What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 
The file sundevcgregh isn't being found

	Sun omitted sundevcgregh from SunOS  Remove the include 
from sunCGCc and replace it with the line 
	define CGVADDRCOLOR   x
The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied 
from another distribution


Subject   What are these problems using R shared libraries on SunOS 
All of the executables that I try to run have the following results
	ldso libXmuso not found
or even
	ldso call to undefined procedure GetHostname from xfac

	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun remember that you 
need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if you've
installed X on a fileserver run it on the server's clients too  While 
building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have eg those 
distributed with OpenWindows  You should make sure you do not have 
LDLIBRARYPATH set in your environment during the build or the installation  
If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in usrlib usrlocallib or 
usrlib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked 
statically courtesy MIT X Consortium
	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it
attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed
You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass Bstatic to
most C compilers


Subject   Can OLIT programs run with R Xt XtQString undefined

This is a bug in the OLIT  XtQString was an external symbol that existed in 
XR upon which OW 's libXt is based  It wasn't documented and was 
removed in XR MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R and R
libraries only applied to the documented interface  

A workaround is to temporarily set your LDLIBRARYPATH to point to the XR
or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against

Subject   How do I get around the SunOS  security hole

	There is a security problem with certain R clients xterm and xload
running under SunOS  that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these
	 make the program nonsetuid You should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources eg ptys and devkmem used
by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site
	 relink the programs statically using Bstatic
	 install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries

from rwsexpolcsmitedu Bob Scheifler 

The R version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newlyinstalled libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively Note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFSmounted disks 
Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem


Subject   How do I get around the framebuffer security hole

	On many systems the framebuffer is unsecured by default this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the framebuffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying to accidentally start up a second X session on your console 
display Check the man page for fbtab

Subject   TOPIC BUILDING X PROGRAMS 

Subject   What is Imake

	Imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a
makefilegenerator that takes advantages of the includefile and macro
processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system Although it is not 
specific to X the X release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable
	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by
which the systemspecific configuration files systemindependent configuration
files and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not 
obvious
	There have been several different versions of imake the R R and
R versions are different

	You can obtain information on imake from these sources
	 the R and R release notes and imake man page include information on
using Imake to build X
	 the R and R file mitconfigREADME also contains useful information
	 on the R tapes contribdocimakeimaketex is Mark Moraes' RR
guide to imake
	 the R mitdocconfigusenixwspaperms contains a paper by Jim
Fulton on an early version of Imake
	 Paul Dubois duboisprimatewiscedu has written a useful 
explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non
supported systems the document is available from ftpprimatewiscedu
in the directory ftppubimakestuff look for configXRms troff and 
configXRps PostScript Some supplemental appendices are nearby 
 document version is now  These imake papers are available by email
mail a message body of send imakestuff help to almanacprimatewiscedu
	 see System Administration  Imake Friend of Foe by Dinah McNutt
in the November  issue of SunExpert
	 German readers should expect in June  an article Das MetaMake 
 I make you make  Schwerelos by Rainer Klute in iX 
MultiuserMultitaskingMagazin directed at application programmers needing to

X Journal issue 
	 The O'Reilly X Resource issue  contains Paul Davey's article on
demystifying Imake
	 Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in 
sasunepflchpubimakefileZ




Subject   Where can I get imake

	Versions are distributed with the R and R releases An earlier 
version is distributed with the XR release some thirdparty toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files There are no real standards for such 
configuration files although most current contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with XR
	export contains the R distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution
	A standalone version of Imake but one stemming from XR is in
ftpgermanyeunetpubXmiscimakeimakepuretarZ 


Subject   I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile What to do

	If you have R or R installed on your system run xmkmf This is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments The output is a 
Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile Then run make 
which will use that new Makefile to compile the program


Subject   Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines
When I try to compile certain programs I get the following link error
	Undefined
	XShapeQueryExtension
	XShapeCombineMask

	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X SHAPE
which was introduced in the MIT XR distribution and allows nonrectangular
windows  Like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it  PreXR servers as well as many 
vendorsupplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway

	In order to use the shape extension you must link to the library 
libXexta  In the XR distribution this library and the associated includes
will be in the mitextensions directory  If you do not have these files do 
not despair  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the DSHAPE define from the Makefile you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendorsupplied X 
libraries

from John B Melby melbyykfujitsucojpuunetuunet 


Subject   What are these problems with XtInherit not found on the Sun
When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS  or  machine I get the 
error ldso symbol not found XtInherit

	What you are seeing is a sideeffect of a kludge in the R libXta to 
get Sun shared libraries working  Apparently you can't share a function that 
is both called and compared as XtInherit is This was handled by putting 
XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded  that is in Initializec where 
XtToolkitInitialize and XtInitialize reside These routines would normally
be called

	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
Xtbased program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize anywhere 
	 it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the X server  OSFMotif's  UIL had this problem it called
XtMalloc and other Xt functions The solution is to add the call to your 
program the function does not have to be executed just linked in
	 alternatively your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is
correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize  it may be an Xlib or XView 
program In this case you can remove lXt from your link command 

	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically
although this will certainly solve the problem

Subject   Why can't I compile my R Xaw contrib programs under the new X
I have a program that worked well under XR When I try to link it under 
the current version of X I get this message
	Undefined
	XtScrollBarSetThumb
	XtTextSetInsertionPoint
	XtTextReplace

	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set in addition
to the header files moving into XXaw these are mentioned in the R
release notes In this case these functions are not really Xt functions but
are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt to Xaw



Subject   TOPIC PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES

Subject   Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for sic

	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another  In order to get keystrokes your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus  To do this you must set up what are
called hints for the window manager  If your applications is Xlibbased you
can use something like the following

        XWMHints wmhints
        
        wmhintsflags  InputHint
        wmhintsinput  True
        XSetWMHintsdpy window wmhints

If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics you can set the XtNinput 
resource to be True as you probably want to in any case if you don't have
source you can start up the application with the resource 'inputTrue'

Certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having 
this done 

	If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCMcompliant
	OpenWindowsFocusLenience       true

mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun


Subject   How do I figure out what window manager is running

	You can't reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case 
	For most cases you shouldn't care which window manager is running so 
long as you do things in an ICCCMconformant manner There are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases Alternatively it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific added features such as olwm's pushpin menus in order
to give your program added functionality Beware of usurping the window 
manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing
this surely leads to future compatibility problems


Subject   Is there a skeleton X program available
	
	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the 
Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development In X the problem is typically solved by using an interactive

Subject   Why does XtGetValues not work for me sic

	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable Your code may be doing something like this
	
	Arg args
	int i
	int sensitive		 oops wrong data type 
	i
	XtSetArg argsi XtNsensitive sensitive i
	XtGetValueswidget args i 
	
	

But XtNsensitive is a Boolean which on most machines is a single byte 
declaring the variable sensitive as Boolean works properly This problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types 
Dimension and Position code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short In general you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widget's man page



Subject   Why don't XtConfigureWidgetXtResizeWidgetXtMoveWidget work

	You're probably trying to use these functions from application code
They should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children Other promising 
functions XtMakeGeometryRequest and XtMakeResizeRequest are also for use 
only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent
	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources
Although this will result in the widgetinternal functions' being called your
application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the 
widgets' data becoming corrupted
	The Xlib calls XMoveWindow and XResizeWindow should similarly be 
avoided they shouldn't be used to change XtNx XtNy XtNwidth or XtNheight


Subject   Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow

	Although there are various details of the current implementation of
the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the new widget should be Resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves
What should happen to the widget's children And by the time such semantics are
defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired 
resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new widget

	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit

Window placement on screen


I would like to configure my system a HP UNIX to avoid that any corner
of a given window is displayed outside of the visible screen The whole
window should be visible and it should be impossible to move any window
outside the visible aerea

 Can this be done by configuring the window manager's resources

 Can this be done on applikation level 

 A hardcoded solution is possible but is it possible to have a
  upper limit of a given window size


Thank you for information and help

Subject   I'm writing a widget and can't use a float as a resource value

Float resources are not portable the size of the value may be larger than
the size of an XtPointer Try using a pointer to a float instead the Xaw
Scrollbar float resources are handled in this way

Subject   Are callbacks guaranteed to be called in the order registered

	Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt
happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered 
the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental 
authoritative documents ie the AsenteSwick volume do say that the order is
undefined  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and
the application Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution
	In general the callback procedures should be thought of as operating 
independently of one another and should not depend on sideeffects of other
callbacks operating if a seqence is needed then the single callback to be 
registered can explicitly call other functions necessary

Subject   Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget actually destroy the widget

	XtDestroyWidget operates in two passes in order to avoid leaving
dangling data structures the functioncall marks the widget which is not 
actually destroyed until your program returns to its eventloop 


Subject   How do I query the user synchronously using Xt
	
	It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback
which has a clear flow of control The calls to AskUser block until answer
is set to one of the valid values If it is not a yes answer the code drops
out of the callback and back to an eventprocessing loop 

	void quitWidget w XtPointer client XtPointer call
	
		int             answer
		answer  AskUserw Really Quit
		if RETYES  answer
			
			answer  AskUserw Are You Really Positive
			if RETYES  answer
				exit
                
	

	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether 
to overwrite it
	This is accomplished by entering a second eventprocessing loop and
waiting until the user answers the question the answer is returned to the
calling function That function AskUser looks something like this where the 
Motif can be replaced with widgetsetspecific code to create some sort of 
dialogbox displaying the question string and buttons for OK Cancel and 
Help or equivalents

  int AskUserw string
        Widget          w

        return answer
  

	The dialog supports three buttons which are set to call the same 
function when tickled by the user  The variable answer is set when the user 
finally selects one of those choices

  void responsew client call
        Widget          w

                break
        default
                return

Subject   How do I determine the name of an existing widget
I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is

	Users of R and later are best off using the XtName function which 
will work on both widgets and nonwidget objects

	If you are still using R you can use this simple bit of code to do 
what you want Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures 
and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt including R

	include XCorePh
	include XXresourceh
	String XtName widget
	Widget widget	 WILL work with nonwidget objects 
	
	return XrmNameToStringwidgetcorexrmname

Subject   Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindowwidget
I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics
within my Xtbased program

 canvas  XtCreateManagedWidget  widgetClass  drawing area 
 
 window  XtWindowcanvas	 get the window associated with the widget 
 
 XDrawLine window	 produces error 

	The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the 
realization of the widget  Using a window id of NULL no window could 
create the error that you describe  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget 
before attempting to use the window associated with a widget 
	Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget call 
but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet so you should also 
wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it


Subject   Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage

The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of 
the screen If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it you can take
the following steps to avoid the error

 Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture
 Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle
 Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap
 If you get a NoExpose event the copy was clean Use XGetImage to grab the
image from the pixmap
 If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events the copy wasn't clean and 
the xywidthheight members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you 
the parts of the pixmap which aren't good
 Get rid of the pixmap it probably takes a lot of memory

Subject   How can my application tell if it is being run under X

	A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight
characteronly mode The easiest way for an application to determine that it is
running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server
	
	display  XOpenDisplaydisplayname
	if display
		 do X stuff 
	else
		 do curses or something else 
where displayname is either the string specified on the commandline following
display by convention or otherwise is charNULL in which case 
XOpenDisplay uses the value of DISPLAY if set

This is superior to simply checking for the existence a display commandline 
argument or checking for DISPLAY set in the environment neither of which is 
adequate 


Subject   How do I make a busy cursor while my application is computing
Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor for every window in my application

	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is 
as large as the largest possible screen make it a child of your toplevel 
window and it will be clipped to that window so it won't affect any other 
application It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the 
user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual 
desktop Substitute toplevel with your topmost widget here similar code 
should work for Xlibonly applications just use your top Window

     unsigned long valuemask
     XSetWindowAttributes attributes

      Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed 
     valuemask  CWDontPropagate  CWCursor
     attributesdonotpropagatemask   KeyPressMask  KeyReleaseMask 
         ButtonPressMask  ButtonReleaseMask  PointerMotionMask
     attributescursor  XCreateFontCursorXtDisplaytoplevel XCwatch

      The window will be as big as the display screen and clipped by
        its own parent window so we never have to worry about resizing 
     XCreateWindowXtDisplaytoplevel XtWindowtoplevel  
           unsigned int   InputOnly
         CopyFromParent valuemask attributes

where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen
particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than


When you want to use this busy cursor map and raise this window to go back to
normal unmap it This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse
events depending on precisely how the window manager works it may or may not
have a similar effect on keystrokes as well

In addition note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor 
resource which can be temporarily reset should you merely wish to change the
cursor without blocking pointer events

Subject   How do I fork without hanging my parent X program

	An Xbased application which spawns off other Unix processes which 
continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its 
children are terminated the children inherit from the parent the open X 
connection to the display 
	What you need to do is fork then immediately in the child process 
		close ConnectionNumberXtDisplaywidget
to close the filedescriptor in the display information After this do your 
exec You will then be able to exit the parent
	Alternatively before exec'ing make this call which causes the file 
descriptor to be closed on exec

Subject   Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler

	No Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical 
sections If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time which 
might be while the function you are calling is already executing it can leave
the library in an inconsistent state Note that the ANSI C standard points
out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to
Xlib and Xt the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be
called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by 
Xlib or Xt functions
	You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt
handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which
has previously been added

	Note the article in The X Journal  and the example in O'Reilly 
Volume  are in error

Thanks to Pete Ware warecisohiostateedu and Donna Converse 
converseexpolcsmitEDU 


Subject   What are these Xlib sequence lost errors

	You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error 
handler or more likely if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or 
Xlib from a signal handler which you shouldn't be doing in any case 


Subject   How can my Xt program handle socket pipe or file input

	It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input 
both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor but 
which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or 
the other file descriptor
	A solution is use XtAppAddInput After you open your file descriptor
use XtAppAddInput to register an input handler The input handler will be 
called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your 
program's attention Write the input handler like you would any other Xt 
callback so it does its work quickly and returns  It is important to use only
nonblocking IO system calls in your input handlers
	Most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an 
input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish
	Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file
You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending
XtAppAddInput is actually working as it is supposed to The input handler is 
called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read not only when there is
new data to be read A disk file unlike a pipe or socket is almost always 
ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning
and read data you've read before  The result is that your function will almost
always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop There is a way to get the 
type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your 
function to test whether there is new data
	     if ioctlfd FIONREAD n    n   return
But because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a 
busywait you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput and instead setting 
a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input

Subject   How do I simulate a button pressrelease event for a widget

	You can do this using XSendEvent it's likely that you're not setting
the window field in the event which Xt needs in order to match to the widget
which should receive the event
	 If you're sending events to your own application then you can use 
XtDispatchEvent instead This is more efficient than XSendEvent in that you
avoid a roundtrip to the server
	Depending on how well the widget was written you may be able to call
its action procedures in order to get the effects you want

 XDrawLinethedisplaythewindowtheGC
 

	You are right to map the window before drawing into it However the 
window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen 
until your application receives an Expose event Drawing done before that will 
generally not appear You'll see code like this in many programs this code 
would appear after window was created and mapped
  while done

      switch theeventtype 
	case Expose	  On expose events redraw 
		XDrawLinethedisplaythewindowtheGC
		break
	
	
    

	Note that there is a second problem some Xlib implementations don't 
set up the default graphics context to have correct foregroundbackground 
colors so this program could previously include this code
  
  theGCvaluesforegroundBlackPixelthedisplaythescreen	 eg 
  theGCvaluesbackgroundWhitePixelthedisplaythescreen	 eg 
  theGC  XCreateGCthedisplaythewindow
                GCForegroundGCBackgroundtheGCvalues
  
 
Note the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that  is 
black and  is white or viceversa  The relationship between pixels  and  
and the colors black and white is implementationdependent  They may be 
reversed or they may not even correspond to black and white at all

Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong 
thing to do in a finished program as it ignores the user's preference for 
foreground and background

And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xtbased program
if you draw into the XtWindoww right after it has been realized it may
not yet have appeared


Subject   What is the difference between a Screen and a screen

	The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about
one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports A 
server can support several independent screens They are numbered unix
unix unix etc the 'screen' or 'screennumber' is the second digit 
the    which can be thought of as an index into the array of available 
Screens on this particular Display connection
	The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular
Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms  one
which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screennumber
	In Xtbased programs you typically use XtScreenwidget to determine 
the Screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen
	Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros
which return characteristics of the Screen have Display in the names  
XDisplayWidth XDisplayHeight etc

Subject   Can XGetWindowAttributes get a window's background pixelpixmap

	No  Once set the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be 
reread by clients  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap
set it to be the background pixmap of a window and then free the pixmap The 
window keeps this background but the pixmap itself is destroyed  If you're 
sure a window has a background pixel not a pixmap you can use XClearArea 
to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage to read 
back that pixel  However this action alters the contents of the window and 
it suffers from race conditions with exposures courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD 
and Stuart Marks of Sun

	Note that the same applies to the border pixelpixmap This is a 
misfeature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the
pixelpixmap however it wants  By not requiring the server to keep the 
original pixel or pixmap some potentially a lot of space can be saved

Subject   How do I create a transparent window
	
	A completely transparent window is easy to get  use an InputOnly
window In order to create a window which is mostly transparent you have
several choices
	 the SHAPE extension first released with XR offers an easy way to
make nonrectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the
areas where the window should be nontransparent however not all servers 
support the extension
	 a machinespecific method of implementing transparent windows for
particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware  Note 
that there is no X notion of a transparent color index
	 a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny 
windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult
	 a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent
window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application
window with information if so you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors
that will appear properly

Subject   Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematicallycorrect color values

	When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a
background of black for example should produce white However the drawing
operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices The color that
the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually
random unless you have actually filled it in yourself On many X servers Black
and White often  or  programs taking advantage of this mathematical
coincidence will break
	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor then you should be 
allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen
precomputed values
	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors then you 
can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC graphics 
context to  and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over 
red say the result is blue and when it draws over blue the result is red 
This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and 
blue

Subject   Why does every color I allocate show up as black

	Make sure you're using  bits and not   The red green and blue 
fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that  is nothing and  is 
fullblast If you forget to scale using for example  for each color 
the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is 
usually black

Subject   Why can't my program get a standard colormap
I have an imageprocessing program which uses XGetRGBColormap to get the 
standard colormap but it doesn't work 

	XGetRGBColormap when used with the property XARGBDEFAULTMAP does 
not create a standard colormap  it just returns one if one already exists
Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first

 from der Mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu


Subject   Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage 

	The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined  This means that most
servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there 
 which is usually garbage  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using
XFillRectangle with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever 
color you want as your background or L if you are using the pixmap as a 
mask courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun


Subject   How do I check whether a window ID is valid
My program has the ID of a window on a remote display I want to check whether
the window exists before doing anything with it

	Because X is asynchronous there isn't a guarantee that the window 
would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an
event to the window or otherwise manipulated it What you should do is send the
event without checking but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow 
errors which would indicate that the window no longer exists This scheme will
work except on the rare occasion that the original window has been destroyed 
and its ID reallocated to another window

Subject   Can I have two applications draw to the same window

	Yes The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources actually
the server assigns some bits the client others and any application that 
knows the ID can manipulate the resource almost any X server resource except
for GCs and private color cells can be shared
	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple 
applications A simple way to handle this and which solves the problem of the
applications' running on different machines is in the first application to 
create a speciallynamed property on the rootwindow and put the window ID into
it The second application then retrieves the property whose name it also
knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window
	Note this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first
application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned
in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays
	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higherlevel 
cooperation among your applications 
	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to 
use the same server connection If one process is a child of the other it 
should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection

Subject   Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm

	A number of applications including xwd xwininfo and xsetroot do not
handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use they typically return 
the wrong child of root A general solution is to add this code or to use it in
your own application where you would normally use RootWindowdpyscreen

  Description Gets the root window even if it's a virtual root
  Arguments the display and the screen
  Returns the root window for the client

Subject   How do I keep a window from being resized by the user

	Resizing the window is done through the window manager window managers
can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window but 
there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen You can try setting 
the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best 



Subject   How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times

	It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself
eg by tracking VisibilityNotify events so that it isn't overlapped  
imagine the conflict between two such programs running  
	The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack
is to make the window overrideredirect this means that you are temporarily
assuming windowmanagement duties while the window is up so you want to do 
this infrequently and then only for short periods of time eg for popup 
menus or other short parametersetting windows

Subject   How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X

	There is no easy way  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of
extension as yet nonexistent you have to arrange for the blinking yourself
either by redrawing the contents periodically or if possible by playing games
with the colormap and changing the color of the contents

Thanks to mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu der Mouse 


Subject  How do I get a doubleclick in Xlib

	Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help 
get notification of doubleclicking
	There is no good way to get only a doubleclick in Xlib because the 
protocol does not provide enough support to do doubleclicks  You have to do 
clientside timeouts unless the singleclick action is such that you can defer
actually taking it until you next see an event from the server  Thus you 
have to do timeouts which means systemdependent code  On most UNIXish 
implementations you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of 
the X connection and then use select or something similar on that
	Note that many userinterface references suggest that a doubleclick
be used to extend the action indicated by a singleclick if this is the case
in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise
check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should
be the singleclick action or the doubleclick action

Subject  How do I render rotated text
	
	Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics 
capabilities leaving them up to serverextensions or clientsside graphics
libraries
	Your only choice if you want to stay within the core X protocol is to
render the text into a pixmap read it back via XGetImage rotate it by 
hand with whatever matrices you want and put it back to the server via 
XPutImage more specifically
	 create a bitmap B and write your text to it
	 create an XYBitmap image I from B via XGetImage
	 create an XYBitmap Image I big enough to handle the transformation
	 for each xy in I Ixy  Iab where 
		a  x  costheta  y  sintheta
		b  x  sintheta  y  costheta
	 render I
	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose
bits an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better
	The highlevel serverextensions and graphics packages available for X 
also permit rendering of rotated text Display PostScript PEX PHiGS and GKS
although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the
same fonts that would be found on a printer
	In addition if you have enough access to the server to install a font
on it you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some
predefined angle Your application can then itself figure out placement of each
glyph

Liam Quin leesqcom 

	InterViews C UI toolkit in the X contrib software has support for
rendering rotated fonts in X  It could be one source of example code
Brian R Smith brsmithcsumnedu 
	Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts they are 
strokerendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine 
requests ericpencomcom 

	The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson mppasymasussexacuk 
posted to compsourcesx July   paints a rotated font by implementing 
the method above and by using an outline Hershey font
	The xvertext package by Alan Richardson mppasymasussexacuk is a 
set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle  Version  
was recently released to altsources and compsourcesmisc  it is also 
on export as contribxvertextsharZ 

	O'Reilly's X Resource Volume  includes information from HP about
modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text


Subject   What is the X Registry How do I reserve names

	There are places in the X Toolkit in applications and in the X
protocol that define and use string names The context is such that conflicts
are possible if different components use the same name for different things
	The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains
orgainization names selection names selection targets resource types
application classes and class extension record types and several others
	The list as of  is in the directory mitdocRegistry on the R 
tape it is also available by sending send docs registry to the xstuff mail
server
	To register names first come first served or to ask questions send 
to xregistryexpolcsmitedu be sure to include a postal address for
confirmation

IK of any mouse button I want to be able to restrict this
IK to one of the  buttons I tried ButtonPressMask but
IK just get undefined errors I know it can be done and I
IK am pretty sure theres an easy answer to it but I just don't know
IK what it is
IK time is of the essence 

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press However in your
event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find
which button was pressed ie

void
SomeEventHandlerWidget w XtPointer data XEvent event

     Catch the button  usually left button

         do some action 
     else 
         do nothing and exit from function

   I am writing a program which needs to draw colour XPM pixmap files onto a background without having the borders show up I cannot do xor as the colours all stuff up I cannot use XCopyPlane as that is for single planes only I want to be able to specify a colour in the pixmap to be used as the opaque colour Is this possible 
 
 Games such as xjewel have the same problem How does the mouse pointer do it
 
 Any help would be helpful 
 

You wanna do masking Build a bitmap pixmap of depth one where all pixels
you name opaque are  that get copied and the others are  Use this
bitmap as the clipmask in the gc used for XCopyArea and remember to
adjust the cliporigin coordinates to the XCopyArea blit origin

The Mouse pointer besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares uses a mask too

But be warned blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers it flickers even at  MIPS

  This is a simple X graphics question
  
  Assume you have a valid Window w an icon pixmap and the background
  mask also a pixmap for that icon  You wish to place the icon at xy
  in w without the background
  
  Question What combination of XCopyArea and GC functions are necessary
  I think the idea is to merge only those pixels of pixmap into w as
  indicated by the corresponding mask pixel value  Specifically the
  problem involves a pixmap and mask generated by the XPM libs
  
  Any clues would be most appreciated
 
 
 Xpm provides you with symbolic color names which can be specified at load time
 So for doing what you want I would suggest you to define a Background symbol
 in your pixmap file which you'll set to whatever color is used by the widget or
 the window on which you want to put your pixmap 
 This would surely be the simplest and fastest way to do what you want  

No As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted because it draws a full rectangle The way to do it
is masking Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are  and all
not to be merged are  Then set the clipmask of the gc to this
bitmap set the clipxorigin and clipyorigin of the gc to the xy
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use GXCopy
and XCopyArea the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc

Subject     How do I ask a netquestion so as to maximize helpful responses

	When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists be sure to include 
all information about your setup and what you are doing  The more specific you
are the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing  Without
all the details people who want to help you often have to guess  if they are
able to respond at all

	Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it 
from If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system
give details of that too  Give the machine type operating system and OS 
version for both the client and server machine  It may also be appropriate to 
mention the window manager compiler and display hardware type you are using

	Then tell exactly what you are doing exactly what happens and what
you expectedwanted to happen  If it is a command that fails include the 
exact transcript of your session in the message  If a program you wrote 
doesn't work the way you expect include as little of the source necessary 
just a small test case please for readers to reproduce the problem

Subject    What is the ICCCM How do I write Xfriendly applications

	The InterClient Communication Conventions Manual is one of the 
official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment It 
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with 
other clients sharing the same server  If you are writing X clients you need 
to read and understand the ICCCM  in particular the sections discussing the 
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window 
manager  Get it either
	 as part of the R distribution from MIT
	 in the later editions of the ScheiflerGettys X Window System book

Subject    What is the X Consortium and how do I join

	The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of  to further the
development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of 
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software 
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment
	MIT's role is to provide the vendorneutral architectural and 
administrative leadership required to make this work Membership in the 
Consortium open to any organization  There are two categories of membership 
Member for large organizations and Affiliate for smaller organizations
	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail 
with meetings when required  As designs and specifications take shape
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations  
Typically a small multiorganization architecture team leads the design with 
others acting as close observers and reviewers  Once a complete specification
is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium
as a proposed standard  The standards process typically includes public 
review outside the Consortium and a demonstration of proof of concept
	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or 
Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed

Subject    Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif

	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces GUIs OPEN LOOK
was developed by Sun with help from ATT and many industry reviewers Motif was
developed by the Open Software Foundation OSF with input from many OSF 
members 

	OPEN LOOK is primarily a userinterface specification and styleguide 
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications
Motif includes an API specification the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the 
one from OSF However there are other toolkits which can be used to produce 
programs which look and behave like OSFMotif one of these ParcPlace's 
formerly Solbourne's OI is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the
style of OPEN LOOK and Motif at the user's choice

	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from ATT comprising 
their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications

Thanks to Ian Darwin iansqcom 


Subject    Just what is OpenWindows

	Open Windows  is a Sun product that encompasses a window system 
that combines a NeWS and Xcompliant server XNeWS a userinterface 
specification OPEN LOOK and a series of toolkits that implement it including
the SunViewlike XView and the Xtbased OLIT Xlib and Xt implementations and
a number of utilities olwm window manager filemgr shelltool etc

thanks to Frank Greco fgrecogovtshearsonCOM   


Subject    Just what is DECWindows

	DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses an X server the XUI 
toolkit including the Dwt widget set and UIL Xlib and Xt implementations a 
session manager and a number of utilities dxwm window manager dxcalendar 
dxpsview etc

At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped
 


Subject    What is PEX

	PEX is the PHiGS Extension to X
	PHiGS stands for Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics 
System and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation 
and manipulation of D graphics Many platforms are capable of performing in 
hardware the computations involved in rendering D objects the extension 
allows the client PHiGS in this case to take advantage of the specialized 
hardware for D graphics
	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely 
redistributable copyright similar to the current X copyright sample
implementation  Source and documentation are available in the R release
Several vendors are currently selling independentlydeveloped PEX servers for 
their workstations and X terminals

Subject    What is lowbandwidth X LBX XRemote PPP SLIP CSLIP

There are several options for using X over serial lines

SLIP  Serial Line IP this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP
packets over pointtopoint serial links It has been around for several years
and implementations are available for many of the major TCPIP implementations
Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really 
ever uses it since it is horribly slow  The TCPIP headers add  bytes per 
packet and the TCPIP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose rightfully 
so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over highspeed links 

CSLIP  Compressed header SLIP this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 
 bytes of TCPIP headers down to about  or  bytes  It still doesn't do 
anything about reencoding the X protocol  Modems that do compression can help
but they increase packet latency it takes time to dribble the uncompressed 
data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time

PPP  PointtoPoint Protocol this is an emerging standard for pointtopoint
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than
SLIP  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial 
line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for 
running normal TCPIP protocols over serial lines  Running raw X over the wire
still needs compression somewhere to make it usable

XRemote  this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines  In addition 
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPPCSLIP XRemote removes 
redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and 
using LZW to compress the entire data stream  This work is done by either a 
pseudoX server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server  There 
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem
   	You don't have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't 
	otherwise be using them eg if you were going to be directly 
	connected and
   	It reduces the IO overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that
	have to cross the serial interface and
   	In addition to the effects of  it reduces the latency in delivering 
	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for 
	blocks to compress

LBX  Low Bandwidth X this is an X Consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using 
NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol  LBX
will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonlyused information 
eg connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps 
etc and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol The hope is to have a 
Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample 
implementation available in R

Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how
LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu

Subject    TOPIC USING X IN DAYTODAY LIFE

Subject   What are all these different window managers

	The window manager in X is just another client  it is not part of the
X window system although it enjoys special privileges  and so there is
no single window manager instead there are many which support different ways 
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout
decoration and keyboard and colormap focus In approximate chronological order
generally the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM

	wm this simple titlebar window manager was phased out in R or R
	uwm the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed 
although it is very outdated Moved to contrib on the R tape
	twm old Tom's Window Manager was among the first nonMIT window 
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
reparenting window manager 
	awm the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features dynamic menus not found on more current window managers
	cwm cwm is part of the Andrew system 
	rtl Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size
	dxwm Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering
	hpwm HP's window manager offers a D look it is a precursor of mwm
	mwm the Motif window manager is part of the OSFMotif toolkit
	tekwm Tektronix's window manager offering 
	olwm Sun olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style
Guide functionality
	olwm ATT ditto
	gwm Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a builtin
Lisp interpreter Version h  is on the R contrib tape n is on
avahiinriafr and exportlcsmitedu 
	mswm the Sigma window manager is on the R tape
	pswm Sun's PostScriptbased pswm is part of the OpenWindows release
	swm Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple
GUI support and also a panned virtual window configuration information comes
from the resources file
	twm new MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives including the one on the R tape
	vtwm vtwm offers some of the virtualdesktop features of swm with a
singleroot window implementation it is based on the R twm and is available
on archive servers A new version vtwm is based on R and is available 
from export 
	tvtwm Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtualroot window of swm It is
available on archive servers
	olvwm the vtwmstyle virtualdesktop added to Sun's olwm It is 
available on archive servers version   is on export
	mvwm the vtwmstyle virtualdesktop added to OSF's mwm A beta version
is floating around most recently from sureshunipalmcouk but requires a 
source license to OSFMotif  
	NCDwm the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look 
	XDSwm the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals 
	ctwm Claude Lecommandeur's lecomsicepflch modification of the R 
twm offers  virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm source is on export
Version   also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm
	vuewm HP's MWMbased window manager offers configurable workspaces
	Dwm SGI's enhanced MWM
	piewm this version of tvtwm offers pie menus


Subject    Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager sic

	It needn't  What is probably happening is that you are running your 
window manager as the last job in your xsession or xinitrc file your X 
session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your 
window manager is equivalent to logging out Instead run the window manager in
the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like
		exec xterm name Login rv iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action
Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window 
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager


Subject    Can I save the state of my X session like toolplaces does

	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature 
which may be equivalent to writing out a xinitrc or xsession file naming the
geometry and WMCOMMAND of each application but olvwm may have something 
close  there is a contributed application which does much of what you are 
looking for although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces 
Look for the application xplaces on an archiveserver near you There are 
several versions of this program floating around look for a recent vintage

	Some new pseudo sessionmanagers such as HP's vuewm provide for the

Subject    How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager

	DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default To override this 
add to your Xdefaults file something like this line naming the full pathname
	smwindowManagerName   whereverusrbinXyourfavoritewm


Subject    How do I change the keyboard autorepeat rate

	You can turn autorepeat on or off by using xset r onoff The X
protocol however doesn't provide for varying the autorepeat rate which is
a capability not supported by all systems
	Some servers running on systems that support this however may provide
commandline flags to set the rate at startup time If you have control over 
server startup see the man pages for xinit and xdm you can invoke the 
server with the chosen settings for example you can start the Xsun server 
from MIT with the options ar  ar  to reduce the sensitivity of the 
keyboard


Subject    How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string

	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key The xmodmap client which is useful 
for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places just rearranges keys and 
does not do macro expansion
	Some few clients including xterm and several Xbased editors 
accept a translation resource such as
	xtermVTTranslations override 
		KeyF stringsetenv DISPLAY unix
which permits the shorthand F to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm clients To include control
characters in the string use nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the
control character you want to include
	Window managers which could provide this facility do not yet nor
has a special remapper client been made available

Subject   How do I make a screendump or print my application

	The xwd client in the X distributions can be used to select a window 
or the background It produces an XWDformat file of the image of that window 
The file can be postprocessed into something useful or printed with the xpr 
client and your local printing mechanism You can use this command
		csh sleep  xwd root  outputxwd 
and then spend  seconds or so setting up your screen the entire current
display will be saved into the file outputxwd Note that xwd also has an
undocumented before R id flag for specifying the window id on the 
commandline There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for 
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture

	Two publiclyavailable programs which allow interactive definition of 
arbitrary portions of the display and builtin delays are asnap and xgrabsc
There are several versions of xgrabsc version  available on export 
is the most recent
	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it it also renders 
XPM output version unknown It is available on export or avahiinriafr
see xsnappltarZ
	A screendump and mergeedit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernamcsuwmedu as xdumptarZ Information 
softengcsuwmedu
	xprint by Alberto Accomazzi albertocfaharvardedu is available
from cfa  in xprintexporttarZ

	To postprocess the xwd output of some of these tools you can use xpr
which is part of the X distribution Also on several archives are xwdps
and XtoPS which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for 
use in presentations see exportlcsmiteducontribxwdpstarZ and
contribImageMagicktarZ Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive
servers and the Xim package contains Level  color PostScript output

	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display manipulate it and
save it in one of the available formats ImageMagick has similar capabilities

	Also 

	Bristol Technology infobristolcom  offers Xprinter 
 an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers a demo is on ftpuunet
in vendorBristolXprinter

	ColorSoft  offers OPENprint package includes a screen
capture facility imageprocessing and support for PostScript and 
nonPostScript printers

	Some vendors' implementations of X eg DECWindows and OpenWindows 
include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion
of screen or take a snapshot options Some platforms also have tools which 
can be used to grab the framebuffer directly the Sun systems for example 
have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file Some X terminals 
have local screendump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer

	Some vendors' implementations of lpr eg Sony include direct 
support for printing xwd files but you'll typically need some other package 
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer


Subject    How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display

	If you need color PostScript in particular you can 
	 grab the screenimage using a program which can produce color 
PostScript such as xgrabsc and xv 
	 grab the screenimage using xwd and postprocess xwd into color PS
You can do this using xwdps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick 
distribution The PBMPLUS package is also good for this as is the Xim package


Subject    How do I make a screendump including the X cursor

	This can't be done unless the X server has been extended Consider 
instead a systemdependent mechanism for eg  capturing the framebuffer


Subject    How do I convertview MacTIFFGIFSunPICTimgFAX images in X

	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful 
Portable Bitmap Toolkit which includes a number of programs for converting 
among various image formats It includes support for many types of bitmaps 
grayscale images and fullcolor images PBMPLUS has been updated recently
the most recent version  is on export in contribpbmplusdectarZ
	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools 'imconv' in 
particular which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary
It's available anonymous ftp from sdscedu 

	Useful for viewing some imageformats is Jim Frost's xloadimage a
version of which is in the R directory contribclientsxloadimage there are 
later versions available including contribxloadimagetarZ on export  
Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export 
see xliREADME and xlitarZuu version  was released

	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar 
to PBMPLUS  Available via FTP as csutahedupuburt 
weedeatermathyaleedupuburt and freebieenginumichedupuburt

	Xim The X Image Manipulator by Philip Thompson does essential 
interactive displaying editing filtering and converting of images There is 
a version in the XR contrib area but a more recent version using R and 
Motif  is available from gismitedu  Xim readswrites gif 
xwd xbm tiff rle xim writes level  eps and other formats and also has a
library and commandline utilities for building your own applications

	ImageMagick   by cristydupontcom can be retrieved from 
export's contrib area It is a collection of utilities to transform and display
images on any X server The tool uses the MIFF format filters to and from MIFF
from other popular formats PPM TIFF GIF SUN Raster etc are included

	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window  It was written
to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
simple portable and efficient  xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes  It is distributed
as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on
exportlcsmitedu uunetuunet and compsourcesx dbsdecwrldeccom
xtiff  was announced in  it includes Xlib and Xt versions

	A version of Lee Iverson's leeiMcRCIMMcGillEDU imageviewing tool
is available as contribvimagetarZ on exportlcsmitedu  The package 
also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget

Subject    How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window

	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar
	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell
		echo ESCTEXTG
where ESC is the escape key TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed
and G is a ControlG the BEL character

	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories
		alias newcd 'cd  echo n ESCcwdG'

	The digit '' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should 
change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name 
used in the icon use the digit '' instead and use '' to change only the 
icon name

	Note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the
escape sequences into the PS prompt itself

	Note on an IBM RS is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a V


Subject    Where can I find the xterm control sequences

The best source of such information is in your R sources in the file 
ctlseqsms a PostScript version is in mithardcopyclientsctlseqsPSZ

O'Reilly's Volume  the X User's Guide includes an R version of the control 
sequences the standard volume will be available  and a Motif version of 
the book is available now The current R guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences 

Other good sources of information include the R version of that document
and also the file in the R sources called mitclientsxtermctlseqtxt a 
compilation put together by Skip Montanaro GE CRD listing the VT 
sequences It dates from R but is fairly accurate  A hardcopy version was 
published in the December  XNextEvent the XUG newsletter

In a pinch a VT manual will do

Subject   Why does the R xterm et al fail against the R server

Subject    How can I use characters above ASCII  in xterm 

	In order to use special characters such as the oumlaut you need to 
stty pass but also to use a charcell ISO font such as 
	XTermfont 	mediumrnormalciso
	XTermboldfont	boldrnormalciso
The family is intentionally unspecified in this example

In addition you may want to set this in your shell
	setenv LCCTYPE iso

        For a given character above  you can determine the key to use with 
the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below  try using
man ascii For example oumlaut v is Altv and the section character ' 
is Alt'

Subject    Why are my xterm menus so small

	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally If you give 
a resource specification like this
		xtermgeometry x
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
x For the main window this is OK as it uses characters for its size 
But its popup menus don't they are in pixels and show up small To set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly
		xtermVTgeometry x


Subject    How can I print the current selection

	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command 
However a program by Richard Hesketh rlhukcacuk specifically for 
manipulating the selection will help eg 
	 xselection PRIMARY  lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it This command can be placed in a 
windowmanager menu or in shellscripts xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties A version is on export
	Also available is riaccsuwocapubxgetselectiontarZ which can be
adapted to do this


Subject    How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources

	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are 
loaded for your Xtbased programs  XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and 
XAPPLRESDIR  These environment variables control where Xt looks for 
applicationdefaults files as an application is initializing  Xt loads at most
one appdefaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from
the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a 
way that appdefaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies
Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open Windows and you also 
have some R X applications installed in usrlibXappdefaults You could 
set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up 
appdefaults files in both usrlibX and usropenwinlib or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located
	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH usrlibXTNOPENWINHOMElibTN

The value of this environment variable is a colonseparated list of pathnames  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see 
XtResolvePathname

        N      The value of the filename parameter or the
                application's class name
        T      The value of the file type  In this case the
                literal string appdefaults
        C      customization resource R only
        S      Suffix  None for appdefaults
        L      Language locale and codeset eg jaJPEUC
        l      Language part of L  eg ja
        t      The territory part of the display's language string
        c      The codeset part of the display's language string

	Let's take apart the example  Suppose the application's class name is 
Myterm Also suppose Open Windows is installed in usropenwin Notice the 
example omits localespecific lookup
	usrlibXTN        means usrlibXappdefaultsMyterm
	OPENWINHOMElibTN    means usropenwinlibappdefaultsMyterm

	As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above 
appdefaults files in the order shown  As soon as it finds one it reads it 
and uses it and stops looking for others  The effect of this path is to 
search first in usrlibX then in usropenwin

	Let's consider another example This time let's set 
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Mytermad in the current working 
directory then for Myterm in the directory appdefaults
	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH NadHOMEappdefaultsN

	The first path in the list expands to Mytermad  The second expands 
to HOMEappdefaultsMyterm  This is a convenient setting for debugging 
because it follows the Imake convention of naming the appdefaults file 
Mytermad in the application's source directory so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly  NOTE when looking for appdefault files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so T and
S are useless

	With R there's another twist  You may specify a customization 
resource value  For example you might run the myterm application like this
	myterm xrm customization color

	If one of your pathname specifications had the value
usrlibXTNC then the expanded pathname would be
usrlibXappdefaultsMytermcolor because the C substitution character 
takes on the value of the customization resource

	The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is
		usrlibXLTNC  R
		usrlibXlTNC  R
		usrlibXTNC     R
		usrlibXLTN
		usrlibXlTN
		usrlibXTN

	Note some sites replace usrlibX with a ProjectRoot in
this batch of default settings

	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is 
		rootLNC  R
		rootlNC  R
		rootNC     R
		rootLN
		rootlN
		rootN

	root is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory 
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other 
than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether

	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find 
your appdefaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR 
to  a single dot  In R all this machinery worked differently for R 
compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to  a dot followed 
by a slash

Subject    How to I have the R xdm put a picture behind the login window

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdmconfig file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources for example 
your usrlibXxdmxdmconfig file may add the line 
	DisplayManagerauthorize false 
to permit unrestricted access to the display before login beware and also 
	DisplayManagerxrdb	usrlibXxdmnewxrdb
where that file does something for all connections along the lines of
	binsh
	comes in with arguments display  load usrlibXxdmXresources
	usrbinXxsetroot display  bitmap usrlibXxdmnewbitmap
	usrbinXxrdb 
Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste  Note that this is a 
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client

Subject    Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my xsession file

	When xdm runs your xsession it doesn't source your cshrc or login
files You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script
or you can place all environmentsetting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file or
if you set your PATH in your cshrc file the normal place you can make your 
xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script ie by starting
your xsession file off with bincsh 
	If this doesn't work also try starting off with
		binsh
		 Reset path
		PATHcsh c 'echo PATH'  export PATH


Subject    How do I keep my DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine

	There are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv DISPLAY 
whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X
	One solution is to use the clientsxrsh on the R contrib tape  It 
includes xrsh a script to start an X application on remote machine and
xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine
A more recent version is on export in xrshshar
	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse
mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu You can ftp caveatemptor versions from
 in Xxrloginc and Xxrlogindc The program packages up TERM and
DISPLAY into a single string which is stuffed into TERM  rlogin then 
propagates TERM normally your cshrc on the remote machine should contain
		eval xrlogind
where xrlogind is a program that checks TERM and if it is of the special 
format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to 
recreate the environment variables 

	In addition if all you need to do is start a remote X process on 
another host and you find
		rsh HOST n usrbinXxterm display DISPLAY 
too simple DISPLAY must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh 
can be used to start up remote X processes The equivalent usage would be 
		xrsh HOST xterm

   binsh
   start an X process on another host

Subject    How can I design my own font

	One way is to use the bitmap client or some other bitmapeditor eg
Sun's iconeditor tool postprocessed with pbmplus to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of postprocessing to concatenate 
them into the BDF format See Ollie Jones's article in the November  X 
Journal for more information
	The R contrib area in fontsutils and in clientsxtroff contained 
a number of useful utilities including some to convert between BDF font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor
	An easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font a
version is on the R or R XR contrib tape in contribclientsxfed Xfed is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftpInformatikUniDortmundDE  
possibly as file pubwindowsXDiverseXSourcenxfedtarZ It can produce
BDFformat fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers
	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps cursors
XPM pixmaps and fonts Binaries for common machines are on avahiinriafr in
pub in addition the sources an old Xlib implementation have been placed 
 in exportcontrib 
	If you are a MetaFont user you can use mftobdf from the SeeTeX
distribution to convert PK GF and PXL fonts to BDF format the distribution
is on ftpcscoloradoedu and on exportlcsmitedu
	The GNU package fontutilstarZ on prepaimitedu includes xbfe
a font editor and a number of utilities for massaging font formats
	The O'Reilly X Resource issue  contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font
	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize a new version is
in ftpcstitechacjpXcontrib


Subject    Why does adding a font to the server not work sic

	After you have built the font using your system's fontcompiler 
installed it in some directory and run mkfontdir or your system's equivalent
eg bldfamily for OpenWindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp 
dir to add that full pathname to the server's fontpath or if the 
directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found it is this last step that you're probably 
leaving out You can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in 
the path
	Sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a BadValue error
		X Error of failed requestBadValue
			integer parameter out of range for operation
		Major opcode of failed request   XSetFontPath

	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server  The
mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious

 Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file
   system  Remember it's the server not the client which interprets your
   font directory  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
   xset command with shell metacharacters in it eg xset fp myfonts and
   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm

 Is the directory really a font directory  If you're running an MIT server
   or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file
   fontsdir  If you can't find that file run mkfontdir  If you're
   running OpenWindows look for the file Familieslist  If you can't find
   it run bldfamily

 If you're in a site where some people run XRn servers and others run a
   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats OpenWindows for
   example make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using
   Hint if the directory contains pcf andor snf files it won't work for
   Open Windows  If the directory contains ff andor fb files it won't work
   for XRn

Subject    How do I convert a snf font back to bdf font

	A tool called snftobdf  is part of the bdftools package which is 
available from exportlcsmiteducontribbdftoolstarZ and from 
crlnmsuedupubmiscbdftoolstarZ  


Subject    What is a general method of getting a font in usable format

	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution it connects to a server and 
produces a BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it  It can be 
used as an anythingtoBDF converter but requires access to a server that can 
understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools 
such as snftobdf getbdf is on  in Xgetbdfc or available via mail 
from mouselarryMcRCIMMcGillEDU 
	In addition the R program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that
the R server has access to


Subject    How do I use DECwindows fonts on my nonDECwindows server

	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a nonDEC installation
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to
standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size Pick up the file 
contribDECwindowsonXRfontaliases from exportlcsmitedu this file is 
for a standard MIT R server  It can also serve as a starting point for 
creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers 
which do not use the MIT font scheme


Subject    How do I add bdf fonts to my DECwindows server

	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the pcf format
You can produce this compiled format from the bdf format by using DEC's dxfc
fontcompiler Note that the DEC servers can also use raw bdf fonts with a
performance hit


Subject   How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file What is XPM
I want to be able to do something like this
	xclockbackgroundPixmap      usrincludeXbitmapsrootweave

	You can't do this The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the 
same depth as the screen not a bitmap which is a pixmap of depth  Because 
of this writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible since 
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps Therefore 
neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap 
converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a 
resource  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for 
use in many of its widgets however
courtesy Chris D Peterson now kiticscom 

However
	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of 
the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted  by Sebastian Wangnick 
bastiunidoinformatikunidortmundde it permits loading of a number of 
image formats as a pixmap

	The leading generalpurpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used 
by Groupe Bull in several of its programs including the GWM window manager by
ATT in its olpixmap editor and by ICS in its interface builder XPM 
distribution available on export as contribxpmtarZ includes readwrite 
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner  See information
on the xpmtalk mailing list above XPM f was announced in  and is
available from exportlcsmitedu and avahiinriafr an older version is on 
the R contrib tape A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen 
anthonykurangocitgueduau is on export in contribAIcons


Subject    Why can't I override translations Only the first item works

	You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first 
item like this
	basictexttranslations  override 
	CtrlKeya    beginningofline n 	
	CtrlKeye    endofline
					       extra space
The newline after that space is ending the translation definition

Subject    How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones

	One solution is xchron in Volume  of compsourcesx which can show
the time for timezones other than the local one 
	Alternatively you can probably set the timezone in the shell from
which you invoke the xclock or oclock or use a script similar to this
	binsh
	TZPSTPDT xclock name SanLuisObispoCA  devnull 
	TZESTEDT xclock name KingOfPrussiaPA  devnull 


Subject    I have xmh but it doesn't work Where can I get MH

	The xmh mailreader requires the Rand MH mailmessage handling system
which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines A list 
of various ftp uucp email and USmail sites for both xmh and MH is given in 
the monthly MH FAQ one source is icsuciedu in the file pubmhmhtarZ

Subject    Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server
After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started no
other clients are able to connect to it

	The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun for  at least
delete old unreferenced files from tmp  including tmpXunix which 
contains the socket descriptor used by X The solution is to add  type s to
the find exclusion in the cron job



Subject    Why don't the R PEX demos work on my mono screen

The R sample server implementation works only on color screens sorry


Subject   How do I get my Sun Type keyboard fully supported by Xsun
 
Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the 
appropriate effect on the numeric keypad The Xsun server as distributed by MIT
doesn't do this but there are two different patches available
 
The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related 
problems It is available from exportlcsmitedu in the file
contribXsunRnumlockpatchZ 
 
The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys
and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type and 
Type keyboards This patch is available from exportlcsmitedu in
contribsunkbdtarZ or via email from mafdtekchalmersse
 
thanks to Martin Forssen mafdtekchalmersse or mafmathchalmersse 

A set of patches by William Bailey dbgwabarcocom was posted to newsgroups
 to provide support for the Type keyboard


Subject    How do I report bugs in X

	Generally report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you
with the X Window System If you received the R source distribution directly 
from MIT please read the file mitbugreport for instructions Look in
mitdocbugsbugreport in R

Thanks to Stephen Gildea gildeaexpolcsmitedu  


Subject    Why do I get Warning Widget class version mismatch

	This error which typically goes on to say widget  vs 
intrinsics  indicates that the header files you included when building 
your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking 
against was built with check your I include path and L linkpath to be sure
	However the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the 
XR Xt library before patch  the version number was wrong Some Sun OW
systems in particular were shipped with the flawed version of the library 
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you
have seen


Subject    Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster

	Webster's still owns the copyright to the online copies of Webster's
Dictionary which are found at various university sites After it became aware
that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster 
and gnuemacswebster it asked that server sites close off external access
	The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary A
Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvaxcsindianaedu 
 in pubwebsterNeXT
	Unless you want to get a legal online copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access you are probably out of luck 

	However if you are a legitimate site you'll want to pick up the
latest xwebster asis on exportcontribxwebstertarZ  the file 
xwebsterREADME includes discussions of the availability illegality and 
nonavailability of dictionary servers

Subject    TOPIC OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE

Subject    Is X publicdomain software

	No The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not 
public domain which has a specific legal meaning However the X 
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee
	Contributed software though may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors


Subject    How compatible are XR R and R What changes are there

The Release Notes for each MIT release of X specify the changes from the 
previous release  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility 
across releases  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary 
details are given in the Release Notes  Each X distribution site on the 
network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer the 
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree

Stephen Gildea 

The compwindowsxintrinsics FAQXt lists Xt differences among these versions


Subject   Where can I get XR source andor binaries

Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on bpi and QIC tape 
and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from 
Software Center Technology Licensing Office Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology  Carleton Street Room E Cambridge MA 
phone 

You will need about Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and MB to hold
the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies 

PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network

Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same
directory the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a
guide to the distribution

Hi

I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib

I have multiple windows and all can take input and 
show output simultaneously on all other displays

I want to implement a pointer feature 

I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able
to see it

Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed 
I am new to Xlib



replies will be greatly appreciated

Thank you

Prakash

please respond via email

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working  I'm not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from exportlcsmitedu or with
O'Reilly's ftpable example xcms from ftpuunet

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does
which makes no sense to me

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values  So
you can't actually edit any colors

We have X R patch level  bit pseudoColor visual  I've poked around 
in the xcms code in Xlib but without some understanding of the theory I have 
no idea what's going wrong  Can somebody confirm if either of the 
abovementioned programs work on their systems or let me know if they fail 
for you too  Please include what hardwaresoftwarepatch levels you have

Any hints

Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group

Thanks
Karen

Subject   Where can I get patches to XR

	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced
in the compwindowsxannounce newsgroup

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which X is available They are now also distributed through the 
newsgroup compsourcesx Some source resellers may be including patches in 
their source distributions of X

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server It now has 
 patches for XR   Send to xstuffexpolcsmitedu the Subject line
		send fixes 
where  is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch

	Here are a few complications
	 fix  is in four parts you need to request a b c and 
d separately
	 the file sunGXuu which was part of an earlier patch was 
rereleased with patch  note the file doesn't work with Solaris
	 fix  is in two parts a and b
	 fix  is in three parts a b and c
	 fix  is in two parts a and b
	 fix  replaces the Rfixtest for the X Test Suite which 
previously was optional
	 fix  also needs PEXlibtarZ which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for PEXlibuu
	 fix  is in  parts a through i


Subject    What is the xstuff mailarchive

	The xstuff server is a mailresponse program That means that you mail 
it a request and it mails back the response
	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line The
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can 
have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help 
The xstuff server treats the Subject header line just like any other line 
of the message
	The archives are organized into a series of directories and 
subdirectories  Each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an 
index The toplevel index gives you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it

	 The command help or send help causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file
	 if your message contains a line whose first word is index then 
the server will send you the toplevel index of the contents of the archive If
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then 
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the toplevel index 
For example you can say send index fixes or index fixes A message that 
requests an index cannot request data
	 if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the
xstuff server will send you the items named on the rest of the line To name 
an item you give its directory and its name For example
                send fixes   a b 
	You may issue multiple send requests The xstuff server contains many 
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large 
amounts of data The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day If the work queue contains more requests than the 
day's quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day 
Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota it sends the requests out 
shortestfirst
	 Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting 
return addresses  If you use such a mailer you won't get any response  If 
you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like
        path foobarbitnetmitvmamitedu
or
        path barfoofrotz
in the body of your message and the daemon will use it

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuffexpolcsmitedu If 
your mailer deals in  notation try sending to 
someplacemiteddieexpolcsmiteduxstuff

Subject    Does Motif work with XR XR

	Motif  is based on XR
	Motif  available in source form from OSF as of August  uses 
the vanilla XR Intrinsics where vanilla means with just a few 
patches the file fixosf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 
  The file fixosf distributed with the  version or its 
subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix though

	Motif  to  will work with XR if XR is compiled with
DMOTIFBC  and later should work with the vanilla R although there are 
some known new geometrymanagement problems

 is to create or obtain such a widget this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality

   In my opinion a programming degree is still worth having

 Yes but a CS degree is not a programming degree Does anybody know of
a computing course where programming is taught  Computer Science is
a branch of maths or the course I did was
 I've also done a Software Engineering course  much more practical and likely
to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think
they want but also did not teach programming The ability to program was
an entry requirement

Try the 'MSc Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University
It's a conversion course but at least they teach REAL programming

In the space of  months we were taught PASCAL Simula Prolog Miranda
Also some basic low level stuff  was covered as well

They also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software
engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory
and some stuff about comms   

The PASCAL is to be replaced by CC I think next year  I learn't this and 
X Windows programming as well
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months  depending
on your tastes the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching

The one critiscism I would level at the course which I would have thought
invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry 
this would probably need a slightly longer project period say six months but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course

Yes I know this sounds like a plug for the course why not

I was having the same problems compiling XR on a IPC sunos 
If you compile with 'make k World' it will not stop on the
ld errors As was stated in another post the clients with the
errors still run correctly

Jan On a related note how can I use xv to display colored GIFs on my
Jan root display with HP Vue

Jan All I can do with Vue is display xbm's through their
Jan Backdrop Style Manager

Jan xv does not seem to be able to override whatever Vue
Jan puts there

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window probably OverrideRedirect
that is the size of or larger than the Root Window Because the window
manager does not know about this you cannot move resize etc it xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root
window 

Contact HP support and see whether VUE can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code

There's a bug in SunOS  which is alluded to in the FAQ although
there it's talking about XR as being affected  You need to force
libXmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works
around the linker error  The simplest thing to do is edit each of
the Makefiles where there's a failure and change the line which reads
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC lXmu
to
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic

No This is only relevant for OpenWindows x as shipped with SunOS
It is not relevant for MIT R MIT R should compile without problems

I don't know how many hours you've spent on this but the Sun User

SUG CD  is XR and GNU on a CDROM priced at  to SUG
members including a caddy

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and valueadded to our members  Last year the SUG  disk
contained plugandplay XR MB of additional essential binaries
almost MB of Sun patches fullyindexed archives of Sunrelated net
postings priced at only 

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively but to continue to supply as much valueadded
as possible  To accomplish this we will be putting out a two disk
set the first containing what's ready and needed now the second
available later in ' containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks

The SUG  disk which was assembled by Robert A Bruce contains
a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member for  per
disk including one of those hardtofind caddies  If you are not a
SUG member you can become one for an additional  if you live
within the US or  outside

The SUG  CDROM is an ISO  disk which means it can be used
by PC Macintosh and other workstations as well and contains a
total of MB of material including

XR SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES for SPARC as of several weeks after
the initial distribution thus four fixes and the the MIT contrib
distribution are included MB of material  Binaries for X Xsun

 What has this got to do with compwindowsx
 

I agree that this is a side track but it is funny that I skip so many
other articles threads but I couldn't resist reading this one

My beliefs opinions and expressions are strictly my own and do not
represent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes
of any other person or organization
 
but  I have heard that Ford Motor Company has had a recruiting bias
toward engineers and away from computer science graduates  The reasoning
is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements  This is
evidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts
and are not brought on board except in special circumstances  This is
a generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true but there are
statistics  Furthermore most software engineering at Ford gets done
by electrical engineers  I know of  univerities that have merged the
computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you
can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming

But since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted
imagination I suppose I should keep it to myself

What I want to be able to do is to set the cursor
color to the same as the forground color that is set
for that xterm

From the man page

cr color
 This option specifies the color to use for text cur
 sor   The  default  is  to  use the same foreground  
 color that is used for text  

However this doesnt seem to be the case it appears to default to black
or to whatever XTermcursorColor is set to

Feel free to point me at the relevant FM or whatever

Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function XmuCvtStringToWidget I
want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect
two widgets together on an XmForm ie

MyProggyMyListSWtopWidget               MainTextSW

However when I run the program I get the message

Warning No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion

Just like the manual sez

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs  
        
            XtWidgetBaseOffset
            XtPointerXtOffsetOf CoreRec coreparent

However I haven't got a clue where to put it The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widget's classintialize function HOW What's
one of those 

If anybody has any code to do this please let me know the trick  I'm sure
this is a FAQ

  Don't know how to avoid the XOpenDisplay hang but perhaps you could
use something else such as zephyr perhaps

Subject Problem with MITSHM

I am trying to write an image display program that uses
the MIT shared memory extension  The shared memory segment
gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem
But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage
with the following message

X Error of failed request  BadShmSeg invalid shared segment parameter
  Major opcode of failed request   MITSHM
  Minor opcode of failed request   XShmPutImage
  Segment id in failed request x
  Serial number of failed request  
  Current serial number in output stream  

Like I said I did error checking on all the calls to shmget
and shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory
segment as well as checking XShmAttach  There are no
problems

If anybody has had the same problem or has used MITSHM without
having the same problem please let me know

By the way I am running OpenWindows  on a Sun Sparc

Thanks in advance

I'm writing 'xwall' a simple X version of 'wall' and I want it to
put a message up on each of a default list of displays  The problem
is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently
controlled by xdm login screen 

xdm does XGrabServer when it's running in secure mode so do some
screenlocks  There's really no simple way to tell this is the case

You can take xdm out of secure mode  probably not too cool

You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts
a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal
handler  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources

Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory
leak  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit 
regularly

  I'm doing a study on what the following type of users would like to
  have on a Unix Manager  Basically I'm looking for the Unix commands
  and features on Motif window interface which will help the different
  type of users make use of Unix
 


 Personally I can't stand Motif  I also can't stand GUI      Command Line
 interfaces for things like access to the commands I know      Command Line
 and love  I think you'll find that experience sic users    Command Line
 
 					der Mouse
 


A year and a half ago I felt the same way  The I started using
gooyies  Give me the command line when something out of the ordinary
needs done and the gooy when I am doing normal or repative work 
Note that most operations are repetative  Hackers love CLs because
  

What I like about GUI's

	 The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects files
	  text directories etc and and manipulate them in some way
	  such as delete copy paste rename 

	 The ability to have several applications  screens visible
	  and accessable at the same time

	 Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system I am familiar with
	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally
	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use
	  If it has a GUI I can usually accomplish what I want to do
	  fairly easily the command line on the other hand often is
	  a long and painful experience


What I hate about GUI's

	 Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard I guess
	  I have a strong onehanded preference I like to use a
	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something
	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea I have configured my
	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be
	  done with one hand such as navigating cutting pasting
	  searching opening and saving files etc The main thing I
	  need to use both hands for is entering text

	I guess I need to get one of those mice with like  buttons
	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds

	I am in the process of making the decision whether I should
write c wrappers for motif myself or use Motif or Interviews
Though I have downloaded the tar files I fail to see any

	 If you have used these or similar csy toolkits what has been
your experience

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on interclient communications
BESIDES ICCM

I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody SHOWS you how  O'Reilly has no examples ICCM has no examples
Asente  Swick give no examples  in fact most of the books I've looked at
if they discuss ICC at all simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and
then refer you to the ICCM  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and 
Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had
my applications talking to each other

I am not sure however if thats the best way  I'd like to stay independent 
of Unix so pipes andor sockets probably aren't the way to go  But within X
one can also use messages the clipboard and perhaps window groups

I need a text that discusses the various methods discusses which method is best
for which purpose and gives examples  Without examples it's all just words

Thanks in advance

Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask but let me try anyway
I am running xterm and like all UNIX users I run man something Recently
I switched to Solaris  and their man pages are littered with I directives
that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm
The resulting output admittedly a personal taste is very ANNOYING to look at
Back when I was using SunOS  I remember their man pages have some keywords
displayed with underlining

So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under I directives 
for nroff man pages to perhaps underlining or at least disabling it B 
directives are fine I like them And of course I don't want to go in and edit
the man pages inputs Somehow xterm allows one to specify both a normal font
and a bold font but not an italic font

Any pointers suggestions are greatly appreciated
Thanks  John

PS Running xterm rv won't work I tried

You are right to be going Motif rather than OpenLook  Sun has just recently
seen the light and dumped their commitment to OpenLook  In the announcement

This is incorrect  Sun has made no such claim regarding Devguide and as 
manager of the Devguide engineering group I can state with authority that
work on Devguide is continuing apace  We had quite a strong show of interest
from the Devguide user community at last week's Solaris Developer's Conference
Devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool but
as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current

 I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I
 noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets perhaps
 even  faster  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
 were no longer any benefit to performance and that it's just as well
 to use widgets everywhere 

Interesting I'd like to know why

But try it again on a single ethernet with  X terminals on it
and I think you'll find it much slower

	    Compiled by Art Mulder artcsualbertaca

  More RAM Faster CPU's More disk space Faster Ethernet  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation

  Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity

  This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE

  Performance is a highly subjective issue  The individual user must
  balance speed' versus features' in order to come to a personal
  decision  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts

  This document is specifically concerned with X  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation
  However they are outside the scope of this document

     People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides  I'm about  of the
    way through reading it and it looks like a wellwritten
    comprehensive treatment of system performance  I'm unaware of any
    other similar books  ed

  David B Lewis faqcraftuunetuunet maintains the informative and
  well written compwindowsx Frequently Asked Questions document
  Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance

  The compwindowsx FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with
  regards to the X server  The gist of that topic seems to be
	Use XR it is faster than R
  Please see the X FAQ for complete details


Window Managers


  There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different
  features and abilities  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features  At this
  point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger
  is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move
  Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows                           Joe English joetrysteroartcom

  I've found that a good font for tiling is x aka
  miscfixedmediumrnormalciso  It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun x screen
  and still get two  column terminal windows sidebyside on the
  display with no overlap  Other font suggestions will be accepted


The X Server


Which Server
      
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware
  If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X server

  On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun colour server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging  
          thanks to Jonny Farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk
                        Michael Salmon MichaelSalmoneosericssonse 

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference  Jeff Law
  lawschirfcsutahedu advises us that on a Sun system X should be
  compiled with gcc version  or with the unbundled Sun compiler
  You can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other highquality commercial
  compilers on the market

Locking the Server into RAM
              
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged  eg via a call to plock  Does this help
  performance at all  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few
  pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone

Starting your Server
          
  Joe English joetrysteroartcom 
    If you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one  After I changed my
    xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core though

  This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works  

  Warner Losh impSolbourneCOM provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works which I have summarized here

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts  This process touches a large number of
    pages  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory  If you
    put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up

    Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources
    being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so
    forth  All this activity is typically memory intensive  Once this
    initialization is done The process has reached a steady state
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there
  are so many variables to be considered available RAM local swap
  space load average number of users on your system which clients
  you are starting etc

  Currently in my xinitrc I have a situation like
	sleep  exec xclock  
	sleep  exec xbiff  
	sleep  exec xterm  
	sleep  exec xterm  

  I've experimented with
	sleep  exec xclock  
	sleep  exec xbiff  
	sleep  exec xterm  
	sleep  exec xterm  

  I've even tried
	sleep  exec startXclientsscript  
  and then in startXclientsscript I had
	sleep  exec xclock  
	sleep  exec xbiff  
	sleep  exec xterm  
	sleep  exec xterm  

     The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down
    into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched 

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with
  my current setup for its simplicity  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you

Fonts
  
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use you'll get speed increases in loadup time

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one
  large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients  or
  at least all your heavily used clients  to use only those few fonts
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server  This will also conserve server resources since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server
			       Farrell McKay fbmptcburpptcbuozau
			        Joe English joetrysteroartcom 

  eg My main xterm font is x so I also have twm set up to use x
  in all it's menus and icons etc  Twm's default font is x  Since
  I don't normally use x I've eliminated one font from my server

  Oliver Jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom
    Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs
    If you will make extensive use of R scalable fonts use a font server

About the Resources File
            

    Keep your Xresources  Xdefaults file small  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time          Joe English joetrysteroartcom

  One suggestion

    In your Xdefaults Xresources file try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications  For example  reverseVideo true

    Then separate your resources into individual clientspecific
    resource files  For example HOMElibappdefaults  In your
    login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH HOMElibappdefaultsN

     The compwindowsx Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work
    ed

    So when xterm launches it loads its resources from
    appdefaultsXTerm  Xdvi finds them in appdefaultsXDvi
    and so on and so forth  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resourcefile naming pattern  You can check in your system
    appdefaults directory often usrXRlibXappdefaults to
    find the proper name and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification pg

	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits

     Easier to maintain  more usable

     Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCEMANAGER
      property  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker since it doesnt have to load all your resources

     Applications only process their own resources never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them

  It also has drawbacks

     the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database you just need to rerun the
      application without having to xrdb again

     xrdb will by default run your Xdefaults file through cpp  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs they will not
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS

      I had C style comments in my Xdefaults file which cpp stripped
      out  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources  Xt did NOT
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted
      processing the resource file

      The loss of preprocessing which can be very handy eg ifdef
      COLOR''  is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management

     You may also run into some clients which break the rules  For
      example neither Emacs  nor Xvt  will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in Xdefaults

     when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored your client
      will not find its resources  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources            Casey Leedom caseygaussllnlgov

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have and am planning on trying
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my
  Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for
  clients that I seldom use

Define Your Display Properly
              

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server  In
  that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  hostname where hostname is the name of your workstation you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to unix or   By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests
			thanks to Patrick J Horgan pjhrasamdahlcom

  See the DISPLAY NAMES section of the X man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name

  I don't think it's stock MIT but at least Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially
			      Rob Sartin opensisartinuunetUUNET

  Jody Goldberg jodyalgorithmicscom sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  nonMIT patches and so have elected not to include it here  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor  lines patch themselves  In the meantime if
  you want to try it yourself email Jody  ed


Clients


  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running  Think also
  about the kind of programs you are running  For example  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock

  Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word

   Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  eg Xclock Xterm Xbiff are welcome  ed

  I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject
  of X client programs  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries  In
  this case using a nonXt for example client program may actually
  increase the amount of RAM consumed

  The upshot of all this seems to be Don't mix toolkits  That is try
  and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients or just Motif
  clients etc  If you use more than one then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library

  Know your environment and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment

A Better Clock for X
          

 xcuckoo
   suggested by Duncan Sinclair sinclairdcsglaacuk

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of another program
   Saves screen real estate

 mclock
   suggested by der Mouse mouseLightningMcRCIMMcGillEDU
   available larrymcrcimmcgilledu  in Xmclockshar

   Non Xtbased  Extensively configurable  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources

  Of course the ultimate clock  one that consumes no resources and 
  takes up no screen real estate  is the one that hangs on your wall
   

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
                

  From the README file distributed with xterm

  
  		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here
  
   This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution
   
  

  Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites
  Laziness  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available  See below

  If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage   Oliver Jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom
		   Jonny Farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk 

 Xvt
   suggested by Richard Hesketh rlhukcacuk 
   available exportlcsmitedu in contribxvttarZ

   if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get
   hold of xvt   it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog 

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm  You don't have to
   rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm  In it's current
   version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any
   yet

   UPDATE March   I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin brianwarkentineengsuncom regarding xvt  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm  For
   instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling
   speed try this quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap
   bs and see which program can scroll faster  Also while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements We don't have any hard
   numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major

   As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it
   made little difference since if you never use it it never gets
   brought into memory

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm  In summary  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary
   If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it
   Specifically How much RAM each occupies how much swap each needs
   relative speed of each

 mterm
   suggested by der Mouse mouseLightningMcRCIMMcGillEDU
   available larrymcrcimmcgilledu  in
     Xmtermsrcmtermballowax

   I also have my own terminal emulator  Its major lack is
   scrollback but some people like it anyway


Tuning your client
         

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster

  From Scott Barman scottasdcom comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes
    particularly the initial one in the field  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is nonzero and the focus is on a text field widget
    or even just a text widget the Ibeam cursor will blink
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the
    widget code is making a request to the server CopyArea  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to   It is not
    noticeable on a MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference
    on a slower system

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests


Miscellaneous Suggestions


Pretty Pictures
       
  Don't use large bitmaps GIF's etc as root window backgrounds

   The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc

   These take up RAM and CPU power  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a mb Sun  running xphoon as their root window

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation

   If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway

A Quicker Mouse
       
  Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse  I use xset m   in my xinitrc file
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist  See the xset man page for further ideas and information

  Hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for
  fine work  To cover my options I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager  

  eg for twm 
      menu mouse settings 
        Mouse Settings			ftitle
	  Very Fast				 xset m   
	  Normal Fast			 xset m   
	  System Default UnAccelerated	 xset m default 
	  Glacial				 xset m   
      

Programming Thoughts
          
  Joe English joetrysteroartcom 
    To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of
    things you can do  Some that stick out

     For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons labels lists et al use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highestlevel manager
      widget  Again stick to as few fonts as possible

     Better yet don't use Motif at all  It's an absolute pig

     Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly  Try to reuse them
      This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too

     Use a line width of  in GCs  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference

     Compress and collapse multiple Expose events  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one

  Francois Staes franskiwiuiaacbe 
    Just a small remark I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable  somewhat  times faster

   Any confirmation on this from anyone  ed

  Andre' Beck AndreBeckIRSInfTUDresdende 

   Unnecessary NoExpose Events

    Most people use XCopyAreaXCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but
    they forget to reset graphicsexposures in the GC used for the
    blits This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most
    cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's eventloop again and again

   Thousands of XChangeGC requests

    This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded XApps
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection by moving it toward the client startup phase

Say What
      
  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first

  David B Lewis by day dblosforg by night davidcraftuunetuunet 
    How about this swap displays with someone else Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display Goal reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received
  the following confirmation

  Michael Salmon MichaelSalmoneosericssonse
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS with only  MB it was
    essential when I only had  MB

  Casey Leedom caseygaussllnlgov 
    The X Server and the client are competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine  Not really a
    major problem except that the X client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing

  Timothy H Panton thpwesthawkuucp 
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's
    cpu usage is bursty  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpuintensive at the same time is small If they
    are not then you get twice the cpumemory available for your
    action

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 
    cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network typically k vs k for a pipe allowing
    even fewer context switches

Hello

   When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying
cannot load appdefaults file check your XAPPLRESDIR
environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory 
 this is the appdefaults file for BX  in the directory
specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable

   If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable
then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the
BuilderXcessory file is You can do this using the setenv
command under csh Note that the name ends in ad so you will
have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to BXNad to get the
appdefaults to load correctly

   To make sure the the appdefaults file can be read by all
the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the appdefaults
file exists in usrlibXappdefaults or 
usropenwinlibappdefaults depending on how your system is
set up

   Once you have taken care of this set the systemDirectory
resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX 
For example let's say I've installed BX in t then my system
directory resource should be set like this 

systemDirectory tbuilderXcessory

    Thanks

 I am trying to use XCopyPlane to copy a single plane 
 from a depth pixmap to a depth pixmap  Everytime I
 try this I see absolutely nothing displayed  I know there
 is data in the depth pixmap becuase I have checked by doing
 an XCopyArea to the screen
 
 I have been successful getting XCopyPlane to work if I use
 two pixmaps of depth  Is there a problem with what I am
 trying to do
 
 Could someone please scan my code segment and let me know
 where I am going wrong
 
 I have created a XmDrawingArea widget called canvas 
  
     wid  XtWindowcanvas
     display  XtDisplaycanvas
     screen  DefaultScreen display
     pixmap  XCreatePixmap display RootWindow display screen

     wgc  XCreateGC display wid  NULL
     wgc  XCreateGC display pixmap  NULL
 
  Code to read xwd image into pixmap is omitted 
 

Have you set the foreground and background colors in wgc to 
something other than  and   The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros
on your server may not return values suitable for depth  drawables


      Copy one plane into the depth pixmap 
     XCopyPlane display pixmap pixmap
                 wgc   wwidth wheight   
 

Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same  You could
have different pixel values in the image but the fifth plane x  
might all be the same value


      Using the depth pixmap as the clipmask copy it to the screen 
     valuesforeground  fgcolor
     valuesclipxorigin

     valuesclipmask  pixmap
     mask  GCForeground  GCClipMask
     XChangeGC display wgc mask values
 
     XFillRectangle display wid wgc   wwidth wheight
 


If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance
don't use ClipMasks just use pixmap as the stipple in a stippled
rectangle fill  Many servers are very stupid about handling complex
clip lists and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
little clipping rectangles and clips every drawing primitive against every
one of these little triangles


Actually I must also ask the FAQ's  most popular reason why graphics
don't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle

     If you
     look closely at Motif you will see that it is just MSWindows
     with more eyepleasing color and texture  The only real difference
     is that an MS application window can contain other toplevel children 
     while a Motif application window launches its children out onto the
     desktop
 
   aab To those of you familiar with both GUIs is this correct My experience
   aab with X makes me think that this MSW behavior is easily duplicated
   aab with X But I don't know MSW
 
 Another important difference is that MSW doesn't have any window that
 handle sophisticated geometry management like XmForm Also I believe
 that in Windows x you're limited to K of resources windows menus
 icons etc

IMHO this whole discussion named Motif looks like MSWindogs is totally
stupid The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window
Manager that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat
similiar to this of the MSW windowmanaging agent however its name is
But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif in fact MWM and Motif can work
without each other and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason
he switches to another windowmanager All this doesn't influence Motif
which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications and this toolkit
is IMHO uncomparable to MSW because it is much more wellorganized and
features alot of goodies more than the MSW interface

You cannot say A Porsche looks like a VW Kfer ONLY because they have the
wheel and the gear at the same position Motif and MSW are complete
different worlds only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel
at the same position as MSW

   let me point out that both GUIbased wordprocessors and textbased
   formatters both have a language one happens to be mouse and
   actionbased and the other symbolbased

True but that's beside the point This is a fact about an abstract model
of what the GUI users are doing not about what they actually are doing
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer
of the system NB some users may see it too but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer

I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted After
all that's what I do too I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the userprogrammer conceptual models and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system 


   I don't recall the actual stats but something like  in  people can be
   categorized as a symbol manipulator

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim At any rate I don't think this is evidence that  of users think
like programmers Bankers financial analysts structural engineers 
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation But what they do is not programming and programming is not
required to do what they do 

To restate my previous point yes users want to build their own solutions
no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this

What is the directory Xunix for in tmp When I start
x it is created by the system This directory wasn't created 
by root and it contains an empty file X that is owned by me 

						

 I have just finished building XR on a  running Interactive Unix SysVR
and I am having a problem with xterm  On any font larger that x it messes up
characters that are types the cursor seems to be too large or splits into
a  reverse video  outline block which changes when the pointer is moved
into the window  I am trying to use monospaced fonts not p fonts  Is
there any way of changing the appearence of the block cursor is an Xterm

 Thanks
    


I am trying to run xwd on a Sun SPARCstation IPX
with SunOS  and Openwindows  I am using
the Motif window manager I have been unsuccessful
in using xwd under Motif I get the following when
doing xwd out xwddmp

X Error of failed request  BadDrawable invalid Pixmap or Window parameter
  Major opcode of failed request   XGetImage
  Resource id in failed request  x
  Serial number of failed request  
  Current serial number in output stream  

Does anyone have any insight to this 

I currently use a window manager called ctwm which
is very similar to hp's vuewm ie 
it has multiple workspaces  Is there a 
motif based window manager that has this 
same feature and is not a memory pig like vue

I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets I use
Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display
and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject and XtDisplayOfObject
The object was one of the sub widgets  
  The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected
the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one I tried moving the allocation
of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing
changed I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling 
XtAppMainLoop

Thank you for any help

I am trying to figure out the current C toolkit directions
More simply I'd like to know which C toolkit to bet on 
for use in a new long term project

I have the same problem  I have looked at Motif WWL InterViews GINA
and a few variations on the above  I've also done a cursory examination
of Rogue Wave's Viewh  I like Viewh's abstractions best of all of the
toolkits I mentioned but the resulting code looks little like Motif and I
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code  GINA allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance
but the resulting code is almost too Motiflike and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent C code  InterViews looks
promising but I haven't found a free version with Motif support and I'm
not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted
and what if any specific Motif support will be available over time  The
other libraries produce code which is less Motiflike but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of C to simplify my coding task

At this point my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in
C and invoke those routines from my C code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task  Later if OSF or some credible standardssetting body
comes up with a C interface to Motif I will change to that  It does me
no goo to write in C if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now  Viewsh is the only
library I'd consider right now but in our environment we'd end up spending
nearly  to use it and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause
shortterm productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently longlived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the J curve

I've been hearing rumblings about Fresco and it sounds like it may be
what I'm looking for but how far is it from release or at least some kind
of availability  How similar is it to InterViews  If I code to InterViews
will my code work with Fresco  How about Motif  I've heard some mention
of versions of InterViews which support Motif  Will it be feasible to use
Motif with Fresco

Any information would be much appreciated

it doesnt matter what window mgr you running under you can use the X

	XIconfiyWindowdisplay w screennumber
		Display display
		Window w
		int screennumber

as in

	XiconifyWindow XtDisplayw XtWindoww 

does that perform what you want

I'm trying to set up an IPX for another group I copied all the
X stuff that I compiled on my  which runs SunOS  using
gcc  and most things run just fine however I did find a
couple of bugs and when I try to recompile those clients on the IPX
which runs  I get

ld Undefined symbol
   XShapeQueryExtension
   XShapeCombineMask

I know that I can include libXext and get rid of those messages
but I can't figure out why I get them on the IPX and not on the
 any ideas

 
Ned Danieley nddsunbarmcdukeedu
Basic Arrhythmia Laboratory
Box  Duke University Medical Center
Durham NC       or 

My impression is that most people use Motif because their OS vendor
supplies it with X SunOS users excluded and because it is similar in
look and feel to MSWindows and OS PM  Personally I also prefer
the look and feel of Motif no flames please  just an opinion

Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun IBM HP  can't remeber the
other members in the recent announcement I'm sure you'll see it on
virtually every workstation ie Sun IBM HP and DEC must make up the
VAST majority of all hardware


I am also concerned by this prevalence of Motif particularly from the
point of view of writing and obtaining free software  As the Linux and
BSD communities grow however I think that Motif will lose some of
its grip at least in the noncommercial marketplace  


Ports of Motif to both BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups
pertaining to Motif has been high


I just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial
and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using
Athena or OpenLook widget sets and only get commercial software using
the Motif widget sets  


I can't see why  If just about every workstation will come with Motif
by default and you can buy it for under  for the free UNIX
platforms I can't see this causing major problems


Side Note 

All the X based code I am writing and will distribute freely when
completed is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also look
and feel point of view I like it the best no flames on this one
please





No doubt this is an old question but I didn't find the answer in the
FAQs I could find so  here goes

I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X OpenLook
Motiv whatever I remember hearing quite some time ago that there
are tools to accomplish this task

	a is that so
	b are they public domain
	c any good ie
	d advantages over reimplementing the interface myself

Hello Motif World

a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif I got
several requests to send the bindings per email and I know of several people
who have been using Motif and there are probably a number of people I am
not aware of who are also using Motif

My question is

How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailinglist where
people can ask questions about Motif swap stories and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings This would benefit the
usercommunity as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to Motif Motif is still very much a voluntary project and this
way I can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or
changed

If you're interested in joining such a mailinglist please take the time to
reply to this message and tell me so When there is sufficient interest say
about  people or more a mailinglist will be set up at my site and I will
post the announcement of the newlycreated list to this and other newsgroups

I am using an X server that provides  visuals
PseudoColor  bit Truecolor  bit and DirectColor  bit

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent which uses the default visual which is TC

In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the
section about XCteateWindow something like
In the current implementation of X When using a visual other than the
parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used 
in the window attributes when creating or else a BadMatch occurs

This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions
of the XR guides

However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a BadMatch
when I create a window with a nondefault visual
The code looks like this

 cut here and you'll destroy your CRT

Hello Everybody

I have a little question

Due to more features PEX DragDrop many applications when linked with for
example Motif  instead Motif  need more memory in the Xserver
Xterminals only have limited memory normally no swapping possible So my
question

Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free
memory available to the Xserver

So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the
CSS on client side or on server side when there is enough memory

Please reply via email I'll summarize

Sincerly

Issue  of the X Resource the published proceedings of the th Annual X
Technical Conference has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price
titled Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco

The summary describes Fresco formerly known as XC as an X consortium effort
Without doing a complete review of the paper I'll just mention the goals
as stated in one section of the article  the effort has the goal of providing
the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib
Features they want in FRESCO include

lightweight Objects such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C programming interface
editinplace embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

This by no means captures the complete content of the paper The Conclusions
sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
early  with no schedule paper presented in Jan  for a complete sample
implementation

I am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above

If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC You may 
use Xlib to draw over multiple windows 
I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding

 cursmove  XCreateFontCursor dispdata XCcrosshair

 geomvalsplanemask      AllPlanes
 geomvalslinewidth

 geomgcon XCreateGC dispdata rootiden evntmask geomvals



later I can move the rubber band or bands using the following logic


 void Tselectmovebands int deltxloc int deltyloc          
stuff deleted 
            XDrawRectangle dispdata   rootiden  geomgcon

  Otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix
  An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always
  available this is probably similar in the BSD community however I'm not
  really involved there Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting
  bleeding edge ie when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come
  out people like to rebuild their entire systems The prime requirement for
  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license
  Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView
  Individuals may write software requiring Motif but I doubt it is widely
  adopted

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was
able to help me

The problem is that mainwinwin is doing fine but when I create
detailwinwin it does not receive it's initial expose events until
mainwinwin receives an event Here are the relevent calls

mainwinwin  XCreateSimpleWindow mydisplay DefaultRootWindowmydisplay
                myhintx myhinty myhintwidth myhintheight
                mainwinlinethick fg bg
XSetStandardPropertiesmydisplay mainwinwin mainwintext
                mainwintext None argv argc myhint
mainwingc  XCreateGC mydisplay mainwinwin  
XMapRaised mydisplay detailwinwin
XMapSubwindows mydisplay mainwinwin
The event mask for mainwin is
        PPosition  PSize  StructureNotifyMask  ExposureMask KeyPressMask 
        EnterWindowMask  LeaveWindowMask
The flags are
        PPosition  PSize

I then create detailwinwin with the following calls hints has new values
detailwinwin  XCreateSimpleWindow mydisplay DefaultRootWindowmydisplay
                myhintx myhinty myhintwidth myhintheight
                detailwinlinethick fg bg

 Apologies for those who have read this before but noone has solved this 
 one yet so I'm posting again Sorry                                   

I'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than x I'm using Motif 
XR running HPUX   all the functions return valid results but no
cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size I tried

using the following code

unsigned int wh
XQueryBestCursorXtDisplayprogramArea XtWindowprogramArea   w
h

to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns  and  as
the width and height respectively What am I doing wrong and if not how can I
get round the problem

Thanks in advance

 From the README file of version c

 This is the PLPLOT distribution  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for
 many systems small micro and large super alike  Despite its small size
 and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including standard
 xy plots semilog plots loglog plots contour plots D plots mesh plots
 bar charts and pie charts  Multiple graphs of the same or different sizes
 may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph  Different
 line styles widths and colors are supported  A virtually infinite number of
 distinct area fill patterns may be used  There are almost  characters in
 the extended character set  This includes four different fonts the Greek
 alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols  The fonts
 can be scaled to any size for various effects  Many different output device
 drivers are available system dependent including a portable metafile
 format and renderer

 The PLPLOT package is freely distributable but NOT in the public domain
 The PLPLOT source code except header files and those files explicitly
 granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without
 consent of the authors  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT
 object library and header files in a commercial package provided that  it

 We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of
 usercontributed enhancements or bug fixes  If PLPLOT is used in any
 published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work
 which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT  Also please remember that
 as PLPLOT is not a commercial product we cannot be expected to offer the
 kind of support that a commercial product may  There is great interest
 in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only
 afford to work on it part time  Improvements will necessarily focus on
 those which help us get our work done

 PLPLOT is written in C enabling it to run on many platforms practically
 without modification  Fortran programs may use it transparently stub
 routines are provided to handle the CFortran interface without any
 modification of the user program  C programs are required to include the
 header file plploth see the documentation for more details

 The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc directory in the form of
 several TeX files please consult this for additional information 'latex
 plotdoc'  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
 the code so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
 there  Consult 'Changeslog' to see a list of recent changes  

 At present PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems

	 Unix	SunOS
		 AIX 
		 HPUX
		 Unicos
		 DGUX
		 Ultrix
		 SysV
		 Linux

	 AmigaExec

I have a peculiar color problem with MacX Apple's Macintosh X server
I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem It's happened
with the current version  and with version 
When some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows
are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server
to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors It doesn't happen
for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some
Motif clients

I want to create a singleline Text widget for entering a small amount of text

I want it to be of fixed width but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls
automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point
visible

In trying to do this I have two problems

  The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget
   taller but instead it seems to cover part of the text

  The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text
   in order to keep the insertion point visible

Any help is appreciated

Mike

 I am using a DECstation  running ULTRIX V Rev  System

 pixels
 
 
 On other hardware HP SGI I am able to allocate much larger pixmaps
 
 Did anyone have similar problems before or does onyone know how I can
 configre my system to allow for larger pixmaps
 
 Any suggestins are welcome Please send mail to  haaseigdfhgde 
 

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers known as D accelerators
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to
handle thus they set this limit

Didn't your operating system come with X  SysV usually does as far

Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support  Or does
the server generate a software cursor  You can generally tell the difference
just by using it  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity
it's probably a software cursor  If it has a hardware cursor I think you're
probably battling a bug in HP's X server  I'm not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than x  It's quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just 
that

In reality you're probably stuck with a x maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns

   Where can I get xman source  I would rather get 
xman for an HP  but source will do


I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 
a wonderful interactive conferencing program by the way  I'm 
running OpenWindows  on a SPARC  under OS   I have
the following defaults in my Xdefaults file among many others
  wscrawltelePointerName	Kevin
  wscrawlsyncScrollbars		True
  wscrawlcontinuousTelePointer	True
  wscrawlshowPointerCoordinates	False
  wscrawlbackground		LightBlue
  wscrawlswindowforeground	yellow
  wscrawldrawareaframeforeground	Blue
  wscrawlkeyboardFocusPolicy	pointer

Naturally I exited the server and restarted it after adding
those lines to Xdefaults 

If I run the following from a cmdtool pwd  my home dir
  xrdb m Xdefaults
and then start up wscrawl then all those defaults are used
properly  Wonderful yes  Except that I can't get them to be
operative except by manually invoking the aforementioned
xrdb command  If I try
  xrdb Xdefaults
the defaults won't take

So I tried to change the xrdb call in my xinitrc file from
  xrdb  HOMEXdefaults
to
  xrdb m HOMEXdefaults

No go  So I tried adding in
  xrdb m homekbwXdefaults
at the beginning or end of my openwininit file  Still no go

Any notions what gives  Thanks for the help


Hi

I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better
When I set up stuff in my emacs with a keymap and definekeys
I can only access certain of the keys on my XTerminal's
keyboard I can't get eg F Home End PgUp PgDn they all
seem to have either the same or no keycode I have a feeling
this can't be fixed in emacs itself but that I need to do some
xmodmap stuff Can someone help me

By the way I've checked the XFAQ and posted a similar message
to gnuemacshelp to no response

Currently I have the following in my emacs file inside a 'cond'

 stringmatch xterm getenv TERM

 It always seems to return the same number regardless of the window

returnplace is probably incorrect  It should be a pointer not an
integer  XGetWindowProperty allocates memory copies the data there
and returns a pointer to the memory  You should free the memory when
you're done

No doubt this is an old question but I didn't find the answer in the
FAQs I could find so  here goes

I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X OpenLook
Motiv whatever I remember hearing quite some time ago that there
are tools to accomplish this task

	a is that so
	b are they public domain
	c any good ie
	d advantages over reimplementing the interface myself


The simple answer is for you to obtain use XView to do this  XView is a
one to one replacement for Sunview  It should already be provided with
you Sun running OpenWindows   It is also free available as part of the
contrib side of the MIT XR release

 Ports of Motif to both BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
   This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to

 pertaining to Motif has been high
 
 
 I just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial
 and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using
 Athena or OpenLook widget sets and only get commercial software using
 the Motif widget sets  
 
 
 I can't see why  If just about every workstation will come with Motif
 by default and you can buy it for under  for the free UNIX
 platforms I can't see this causing major problems

  Let me add another of my concerns Yes I can buy a port of Motif for cheap
but I cannot get the source for cheap hence I am limited to using whatever X
libraries the Motif port was compiled against at least with older versions of
Motif I have been told that Motif  can be used with any X but I have not
seen it myself

  Currently I have XR running on eight different unix platforms of which
only three came with Motif On those three I am unable to use the XR
libraries to build Motif clients because I get link errors between the
vendorsupplied port of Motif and my XR I anticipate having this same
problem when XR becomes available

  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on XR since I do
not have Motif compiled under XR True I could buy another port of Motif
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesn't it

Dear Xperts

   Here's my problem  I am designing several related X 
applications each one is a separate executable and  I'd like 
to build a single control window that would allow the user to 
access each application instead of having to locate the correct
icon The Control Window would contain a button for each 
application and by pressing it the application's main window
would appear  I would also like to use the application's button
as a color status indicator  Has anyone done this or have any
good ideas  Because these are all separate executables this
seems like a communications nightmare to me but maybe I'm
wrong  I'd appreciate any ideas I'm using XR and Motif 

Thanks

I can think of two different methods that you could try  use fork and 
execv  use the system called in your program  I'm assuming that you're

We are currently evaluating GUI builders initially for Motif but with
a wish to be flexible  portable  We have been through the popular
names UIMX TeleUSE XVT etc and have been very impressed with what
we have seen of Galaxy from Visix  I have spoken to current users
from a list supplied by Visix happy users as you would expect and
seen favourable comments on the net  However since it is fairly
expensive to get an evaluation license from Visix I would like to
query the net for any negative experiences with Galaxy  Did anybody
evaluate them and prefer another tool or use Galaxy and regret it or

keyboard and the other with the mouse I set the keyboard focus on the first
widget but as soon as I click the mouse on the second one I lose the
keyboard focus on the first one 

Could some kind soul show me how to do this

Thanks

I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better
When I set up stuff in my emacs with a keymap and definekeys
I can only access certain of the keys on my XTerminal's
keyboard I can't get eg F Home End PgUp PgDn they all
seem to have either the same or no keycode I have a feeling
this can't be fixed in emacs itself but that I need to do some
xmodmap stuff Can someone help me

It is actually worse than you think  I have the same problem and have
given up  Emacs has an internal table somewhere which defines what
keys it will accept and this table is systemdependent  I use a Sun
from my HP and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work  xmodmap is not
sufficient or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work
However I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work
and I do some customised things with them

Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem and I am using exactly
the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration

Is it possible to run an MIT R based Xserver on a Sun with a Rasterops TC
Colorboard bit board  I have the Xsun patches for supporting sun's
bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
something else  I know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
buying one to put in an IPX

 You seem to be a little confused  The socialistic hackers who yell
 about proprietary software are hardly enamored of Motif which is just

 If I might wear my socialistic hacker hat for a moment I tar NeWS and
 Motif with the same brush and that brush is not technical 

Begging everyone's pardon I was not slamming Motif nor was I necessarily 
pluggingflaming the two  I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in
 rickdigibd from rickdigibddigibdcom Rick Richardson

rick This is one area where Microsoft NT has a big advantage  Since
rick they control the whole show there are no issues like this where
rick licensees create incompatible defacto standards

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when
they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will
also be happy to use it  I remember when SunView was hot stuff and am not
by that statement endorsing Sun and its products this is just my experience
and when OpenWindows became hot stuff that was when I started hearing as
mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying 
anything that was deemed proprietary including OpenWindows  I mentioned
Motif in the same breath because that is what Sun has decided to turn its
attention to not because I hate it  Mr Richardson's position I believe is
a healthy one and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to
flame and destroy NT if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be
free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are 
no de facto standards

It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds

I am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system  In keeping with more classic command and
control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor  
I have a number of X level questions regarding this

We are devloping on Unix systems using XMotif Platform will be 
predominantly Sun's probably with ports to RS as well

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens
and not multiple X displays   Given this

	 Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other  There's
	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
	screens

	 Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate
	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there
	What are they who sells them

	 Is a multiscreen window manager the only way I can grab a
	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next

	 Is there any way for the application to transparently see
	multiple screens as one logical xy plane or does the hardware
	only provide for each screen to start at 

	 Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
	screen perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
	multiple screens instead  
	I am assuming that this is not a major issue  that I can rely
	on providing config files which will specify for each
	configuration the screen placement of each window in the
	application  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
	are more than welcome

G'Day

Windows NT is a step forward but not by much I guess for DOS users who
think multitasking is really neat add puke here and are overjoyed to 
be able to use more than K of memory its a major improvement For Windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for 
granted Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 
rdparty applications anyway so the operating system features are not even 
a real issue My ideal operating system

	Binary compatible across all plaforms It should recognize
	binaries and configure on the fly so I don't have to have
	binMac binDOS binDec binSun binHP etc

	MultiCPU So I can use the CPUs on my PC and WS and Mac 
	and Transputers and DSPs I don't know a single site which 
	has gone for a single vendor I am not going to tradein 
	Mflops per H transputer or ultrafast FFT on DSP chips
	Note NT runs on Symmetric multiCPU systems

	Builtin portable GUIGraphics tools You can call DrawButton 
	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform 
	or display It should also translate graphics commands onthefly
	so I can use PC graphics SW on my workstation and X software on 
 	my PC I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential

	Configurable frontend So you can make it look like Unix or DOS
	or NT or OS and run shell scripts or commandBAT files

	Object oriented So I can program easily under it and not have
	to reinvent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
	or my application needs to access sourceobject code on the fly

In other words it should have some AI capability That and a tight clean
kernel so you can actually understand it Anyone know of something like this

As to how many clients may be display on a server I believe the limit
would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
server

 Given a program running on a workstation with an X based window
 system how can one pop the window in which it is running to the top
 By window I mean the terminal window from which it was invoked

One can't  The application may not have been started from a terminal
emulator if it was the terminal emulator may not still exist and if
it does it may be in no condition to be popped to the top eg it
may be iconified  And even if you can it may not do what you want 
consider a virtualroot window manager like tvtwm with the relevant
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real
desktop

Some but not all X terminal emulators provide environment variables
giving a window ID  Even if such a thing is present in the
environment it may not be what you want it may correspond to a window
on a different server for example

As applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms  multiheaded
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor eg
a Sun with a cg display  multiscreen and multidisplay would
if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning
of multidisplay would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
multiscreen would a system that provides multiple Screens

zaphod is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen

 Is there a limit how many screensdisplays a single server can handle
 in an articel a read something about an upper limit of  

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most  Screens  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R server can
be looked upon as such on a TCPbased system there is necessarily a
limit of  Displays per machine but this is not a limitation

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation probably the MIT one  If it claimed there was a limit
of  inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing
about X

 I am using an X server that provides  visuals PseudoColor  bit
 Truecolor  bit and DirectColor  bit

Lucky dog 

 A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is
 different from the visual of the parent which uses the default
 visual which is TC

 In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the
 section about XCteateWindow something like
     In the current implementation of X When using a visual other
     than the parent's be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap
     which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or
     else a BadMatch occurs

 This warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer
 editions of the XR guides

It applies with equal force to earlier versions  Presumably only
recently did the authors decide it was important enough to mention
The necessity it refers to has always been there but it's been
implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of
the new window

 However even if I pass along a suitable colourmap I still get a
 BadMatch when I create a window with a nondefault visual

   attrcolormap  cmap
   win  XCreateWindow

           CopyFromParent        border width 
                                depth 
           InputOutput           class 
           vinfovisual          visual 
           CWColormap
           attr
         

This is because the warning you read is incomplete  You have to
provide not only a colormap but also a border  The default border is
CopyFromParent which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't
match its parent's  Specify a borderpixmap of the correct depth or a
borderpixel and the problem should go away

There is another problem I can't find anything to indicate that
CopyFromParent makes any sense as the borderwidth parameter to
XCreateWindow  Your Xlib implementation probably defines
CopyFromParent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so
you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the Xlib
implementation not providing stricter typechecking  To be fair I'm
not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this

No  Even if you could the answer could be out of date even before you
get it even if you grab the server it could be taken up by buffering
user actions  You should just try to do whatever you want a BadAlloc
error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available

 When some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows
 are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server
 to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors It doesn't happen

I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design
System MDS from an HP  unix box and running MacX  Sys 
Normally MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally
it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become
washed out nearly invisible I thought that it was just something
brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT

By slightly moving the window and forcing a redraw the colors get corrected

 I am reposting this because I am not sure my first post ever made it out
 I have built and installed XR on my SPARCstation   My aim is to run
 the MIT X server but retain the OpenLook Window Manager  I am sure this
 is not uncommon but I just want to make sure that I change andor delete
 everything that I need to  For instance I can start xdm in rclocal but
 how do I get rid of Xnews
 

  The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes
  or from  exportlcsmitedu  I would suggest building this too rather than
  using the version from OpenWindows It is  olwm  v


I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead This version of the
olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even
on large monitors 

This version is also available at exportlcsmiteducontribolvwmtarZ
The README file also suggest getting the files in contribxview

In my case I built the X Server first Xview second then olvwm All of these
were installed into usrX Once I verified the server worked correctly
I happily issued rm rf usropenwin

Using gcc  to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that 
is for all intents and purposes identical to OpenWindows  and that is     
incredibly faster There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
things to work exactly like OpenWindows but not much

 which added regular expressions in the tvtwmrc file multiple icon
regions squeezable icons and fdeleteordestroy function I still

Almost all window managers twm mwm olwm and their derivates support
escape sequences for it For your purpose put following into your

if  term  xterm  then
	echo LOGNAMEHOSTGHOSTG
endif

Note  stands for Esc in vi you can enter it by pressing
CtrlV and the Esc Same for G it means CtrlG In vi
press CtrlV and then CtrlG
The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon

BTW you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd

alias cd 'cd   echo LOGNAMEHOST cwdG'

I want to implement a pointer feature 

I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able

I've seen a lot of different terms which seem to mean the same thing
Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean

	 multiscreen
	 multiheaded
	 multidisplay
	 XServer zaphod mode

Is there a limit how many screensdisplays a single server can handle
in an articel a read something about an upper limit of  

How is the capability called if I want to move the cursor from one
screendisplay to another
 
 As to how many clients may be display on a server I believe the limit
 would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
 server
 

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this

Background first Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun and other vendor's VME systems

That said Megatek products support multiscreen andor multidisplay
on a sigle workstation Most of our cards have a keyboardmouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays For example say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis You could
put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system
You could then attach from  to  keyboardmice allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays You could
have  screen display  screen displays  screen displays
or  screen display and  screen display Basically any
combination

Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multiscreen and multidisplay They are quite different
in meaning and at least in X have exact definitions

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 
screens in a display As it so happens there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported serverincludemisch
MAXSCREENS As released my MIT this is  As released by Megatek
this is 

As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display ie
X server is  If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry but clearly as pointed out so well by Mr Neto this is
not the case

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more Of
course I could say Buy all you want we'll support more

The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well  Please read
on

I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget
displays the widget for a while then destroys everything and returns  The
problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems
including depending on which calls I make to get rid of things

 Core Dump
 BadPixmap X Error
 Widget not unmapped


Here is a simple C program I wrote to show the problem

include XXlibh
include XmXmh
include XmPushBh

void bla

        XtAppContext app
        Display dis  XOpenDisplay
        int junk  

        Widget topXtAppInitialize app test NULL  junk NULL
                NULL NULL 

        Widget box  XtVaCreateManagedWidgetblaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass
                        top
                        XmNheight 
                        XmNwidth 
                        NULL

        XtRealizeWidgettop
        Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only  XEvents
        for int iii
        
                XEvent event
                XtAppNextEventapp event
                XtDispatchEventevent
        

 WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE
        XtUnrealizeWidgettop
        XtDestroyWidgettop
        XtDestroyApplicationContextapp
        XCloseDisplaydis
 


main

        for int iii
                bla


Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time in this example
after  XEvents the function will exit and return to the main program
With this example I get the following error on about this is NOT consistent
the th call to bla

X Error of failed request  BadPixmap invalid Pixmap parameter
  Major opcode of failed request   XCreateGC
  Resource id in failed request  xed
  Serial number of failed request  
  Current serial number in output stream  

If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidgettop line it just dumps core on the
seconds call

Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize other than the st time I
get

Warning Initializing Resource Lists twice
Warning Initializing Translation manager twice


So finally my question is this

What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates
an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times

Any help would be greatly appreciated

PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group

Thanks very much

I'd like to compile Xr on a Sony NWS running NEWS c  The
X distribution has support for this config and the release notes say
it has been tested on the machine  BUT also in the release notes
nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers  What am I
supposed to use for my r X server then  How can the OS be supported
but not the hardware Is there something in the r binaries that can
be used as the r server These may seem like silly questions but
I'm really confused

Here's what I think have figured out  All I need to do is install
the R disitribution without the Xserver like the sonycf file defines
and all the new libraries utils etc will be installed and my old
server from r will still work  This will allow me to run Xview 
and have Xr up and running  Does the server interface remain the
same with all changes made only to the libs

Another question Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support
that the desktop utils like the file manager will be made public
It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the
benefit of those of us with smaller budgets

Forgive me if this is a FAQ I have checked the list but I cant find it

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO not grayscale monitors
The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input
fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the
input field

The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather
than a block but how do you do this I can't find any means although
various sources seem to indicate it can be done

When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block
This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the
default either

Configuration is   Motorola K XR

Please reply by email if poss

Thank you

Summary                                  

xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window previous versions were limited to vertical text Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages but the notion of rotating a whole font
first has been dropped

What's new

I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings  thus
speeding up redraws

Where can I get it

Hello world

I want to write my Xtapplication code like this


    dosomework
     now I need some user input 
    XmCreateDialog
    waitforuserinputinput
    if input  OK 
       morework
     else 
       otherwork
    


So morework and otherwork are not in callback functions but the
application simply waits for the user to answer the question

How can I code this in my XtMotifapplication

Thanks very much in advance

I use DESQviewX and I think it is great Where it really shines IMHO is
to let unix users log into a pc and run dos and windows applications with

You'll need to get

DESQviewX v                             suggested retail
DESQviewX to Other X Systems v          suggested retail

You also must be running a supported network FTP softwares PCTCP
Novell Lan workplace for dos Sun Microsystems PCNFS Beame and WHiteside
Wollongong pathway TCPIp or HP Microsoft Lan Manager

if you don't have any of this network stuff Quarterdeck will give you a
copy of Novell TCPIP transprot for dos with the Network manager

You can get more info by sending email to appropriately infoqdeckcom

In my opinion if you want to have other people logging in and running
applications at your pc you'll want to have a   with  Megs of RAM
Also the Xwindows software in DESQviewX really seems to like an ET 
TSENG Labs chipset based graphics card Personally I found that things
ran better with a SCSI drive in the pc than with ESDI drives but that is
my experience only

What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas

A couple of weeks ago I was asking for a public domain schematic editor
which is compatible with SPICE and runs under X

I got several emails and therefore I wrote this summary

It seems that there are two public domain tools available

The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at  
hobiecatcaltechedu or
in europe at ifiuiono In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool 
schematic editor layout editor LVS DRC The schematic editor  
itself is
called LOG

The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS' It is also a complete VLSI
package The fully uncompressed release takes about Mb of disk space  
It
should be available at Berkley

That's all I got so far

Does USL SVR support LDRUNPATH a la Solaris

If so you can put the library in a package specific lib directory
compile the app with LDRUNPATH defined and all should work

Besides I'd say name it libPACKAGExcla if possible

Hi Folks

As part of my selfintroduction to X I've been trying to do some simple
icon animation sort of like icondoit from mswindows  Changing your
own applications icon is fairly simple  If you have a widget ID you can
just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap or whatever and you're done Alternately
you can set window manager hints  These methods don't seem to work with
icons which your application doesn't specifically own

In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in 
my icon box so my question is  Given a windowid how do you change the
icon pixure   A working example would be very much appreciated  If it makes
any difference I'm using motif  on VMS TKE

Thanks

ContentsProblems with table widgets in R

	The following part of a program an user interface for a simulation
	system did work in R but refused to in R Of cause the Rversion
	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass we used tableWidgetClass 			instead  caught from the net in times of R and XpTableChildPosition 			formerly XtTblPosition
	Since compiling with R the program causes a zero width or height error
	on sparcstations The troubleshooter is the recomputation of the
	modelinittable  table widget though its childs label and asciiText 
	widgets exist XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero 
	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage Child create zero width or height errors dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not
	
	Question Does anyone know why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered
			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what
			to do about

	I'll be happy if someone is able to help me

   Actually I must also ask the FAQ's  most popular reason why graphics
   don't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
   rectangle

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea 
or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
Window is mapped

The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped  Do you know the best way to tickle a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item

 I wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of
 its childs If it is not then how could it be possible to implement a 
 rubberband across multiple xwindows to select the objects that are
 displayed one in each window

Use a GC with the subwindowmode attribute set to IncludeInferiors The
default is ClipByChildren However beware if any of the children are of
a different depth to the parent the semantics of this are undefined by the
protocol

I want to do the equivalent of an xwininfo name via a call or set of calls

It's probably easy but I've only been programming in X for a little while
I've looked in the O'reilly books and didn't find it and I also checked the

In plain Motify using a dialog 'inline' like this simply isn't done You need

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box which can

If you're willing to do a little work you can make DrawnButtons do what you
want moreorless One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that
in our internal LYMB system

We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of
dial positions from a single set of vectors Each set of vectors is then
drawn into a pixmap Clicking the button advances the knob's state and
changes to the next pixmap in the sequence

Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular
portion of the parent widget but that's normally not a big shortcoming You
can make things look circular enough

 A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different
 from the visual of the parent which uses the default visual which is TC
 

You've got to set borderpixel in your window attributes The default
is CopyFromParent which gives the BadMatch Do this

   
   unsigned long valuemask
   
   
     if borderwidth is nonzero you'd better alloc a colour from cmap
     rather than use any old pixel value Also use valuemask it makes
     the code more obvious
    
   attrcolormap  cmap
   attrborderpixel  
   valuemask  CWColormap  CWBorderPixel
   win  XCreateWindow
           dpy
           DefaultRootWindowdpy
           
           widthheight
           		          border width see comment below 
                                depth 
           InputOutput           class 
           vinfovisual          visual 
           valuemask
           attr
         

A note on borderwidth your code looked like this

   win  XCreateWindow
           dpy
           DefaultRootWindowdpy
           
           widthheight
           CopyFromParent        border width 
                                depth 
           InputOutput           class 
           vinfovisual          visual 
           CWColormap
           attr
         

borderwidth set to CopyFromParent works but doesn't make sense
borderwidth should be an unsigned int You get away with it because
CopyFromParent is define'ed to be zero in Xh If it happened to be
defined as  you'd get a very interesting looking window

The short answer seems to be I don't
The particular package wscrawl seems to reset all its defaults
if any of them are missing from the Xdefaults file  Once I added
the missing ones to the Xdefaults file the problem goes away

I've trawled through the cc and ld man pages for an explanation on apparentlly

the criptic information I found largely overestimates my brain potential and up

if you don't have any of this network stuff Quarterdeck will give you a

Actually infoqdeckcom is our customer service department If you have

In my opinion if you want to have other people logging in and running
applications at your pc you'll want to have a   with  Megs of RAM
Also the Xwindows software in DESQviewX really seems to like an ET 
TSENG Labs chipset based graphics card Personally I found that things
ran better with a SCSI drive in the pc than with ESDI drives but that is
my experience only

What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas   

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself To give you a realworld example here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly  people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other It's not too much of a load on our
Ethernet with maybe  concentrators so you have  people on each
segment If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself Say you have a 
 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card If you have
 people running programs off it you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on effectively a  MHz  Of course DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have  working programs running you'll know it

Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run  people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth
It all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you're going
to see a slowdown from Xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also

Hi netters

I'm using sliders in my XView apps usually with editable numeric
field But I seem to have no control over the length of this field
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters
in some  it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANELMAXVALUE 

As I understand PANELVALUEDISPLAYLENGTH which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items doesn't
work in the case of slider despite the fact that panelh
contains the following bit

	 Panelmultilinetextitem Panelnumerictextitem
	  Panelslideritem and Paneltextitem attributes
	 
	PANELNOTIFYLEVEL	 PANELATTRATTRENUM			 
	PANELVALUEDISPLAYLENGTH	 PANELATTRATTRINT		 

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders
But  setting this attribute gives nothing and  xvget'ting
this attribute gives warning Bad attribute and return value 

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me
and clear this problem

Any help is very much appreciated

Yuri

For some reason the following code causes my X application to beep whenever I
intercept a keystroke and change it's meaning  The intent of this code it to
allow date fields the following special keys

	Tt	Insert today's date
		Bump day up by one
		Bump day down by one

I hardcoded some dates for this example  Perhaps I shouldn't be using an
XmText field for this

 
 
 For some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys
 of Tt are hit  Why  The idea of this code is to interpret these
 keys having the special meaning implied by the code  I would like to get
 rid of the beeping but as far as I can tell I'm not doing the beep and 
 am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring

Another important difference is that MSW doesn't have any window that

Is this an advantage to MS Windows or to Xt  I used to think it
was a big advantage for Xt but I am not at all sure anymore

Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh 
something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes
menu selections and mouse actions  directing them towards another
application

If so could someone send me information on its availability  and if not
how hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and
hopefully deal with their responses appropriately  If an application is
going to take a few seconds to process I probably have to wait  for it to
complete before sending another command

thanks

david

nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea 
or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care
of rendering the new image  Using an expose event handler is a proper way
to do this because at the time the handler is called the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped

The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped  What we need to do is somehow tickle the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item

What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior

Dear Xperts

I've trawled through the cc and ld man pages for an explanation on apparentlly
frequently used compiler options with X programs Ultrix VDEC  However
   
the criptic information I found largely overestimates my brain potential and up
till now I haven't got the slightest idea what the following options are standin
   g
for and when to use them I gathered them from different X programs

         WcNd WcNs WcNt  WfXNg

         NfXNh Olimit 

         Also has anybody the foggiest idea what the following link error mea
   ns
           and what corrective action should be taken I know of bss as the area
    in
           UNIX for uninitialized data but I'm completely unaware of the gp are
   a

colormapInds a large common placed in gp area because of a small undefined
 reference possible gp relocation errors may result
 pixelMap a large common placed in gp area because of a small undefined
 reference possible gp relocation errors may result
 ld
 gp relocation outofrange errors have occured and bad object file produced
 corrective action must be taken
 gp relocation outofrange for small data or bss by
         in the positive direction
         in the negative direction
 Best G num value to compile all count'ed objects creating nmr with is 
 Best G num value calculation reliable only if all count'ed objects were
 compiled with G num greater or equal to maximum size of a literal pool
 item 
  Error code 

         Finally is the options syntax consistent across different vendor's
compilers If not does imake offers a standard machine independent approach to
it

I do realize that an explanation will involve some compiler and OS knowledge but
I pretty know some basics and help of any nature will be greatly appreciated

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubberband
boxes in MotifX  I'm running on an bit display for which I've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget  a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed

Currently to draw interactively I begin with

    drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground 
    mydefaultbgcolor is the color index for the background of my image 
   palettecolorsdrawIndexred    palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorred
   palettecolorsdrawIndexgreen  palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorgreen
   palettecolorsdrawIndexblue   palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorblue
   XStoreColors myDisplay mycmap palettecolorsDrawIndex 
   XFlush myDisplay

   XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXxor
   XSetForeground myDisplay gc drawIndex

Then to draw I do

   XDrawLine myDisplay XtWindow drawingArea gc x y x y
   XFlush myDisplay

And when I'm all done to return things to normal I do

   XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXcopy


What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever I'm drawing over  Instead what happens is I get white lines  If
the lines are over a white background  nothing shows up  If the lines are
over a black area  nothing shows up  It's very strange  But the GXxor
function seems right  since if I do a rubberbanding box it erases and
redraws itself correctly ie not disturbing the underlying image

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
rectangle information then you can use XClearArea to generate an
Expose event assuming that your background pixel is not None for the
enclosing rectangle of your new item

This is still not great since any other items contained within that
rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn

If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything you'll be
doing much more work than just drawing the new item on top of the
existing scene

I am developing an X XtXm application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library GL available on our IBM RS SGI's GL i believe

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow

I have never used GL before but the doc on GL winopen says that the first
time winopen is called it opens a connection to the server   Also most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC unlike most X calls  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily   Is this
true

Does PEX graPHIGS have the same functionality of GL


Environment
     AIXwindows XR
     Motif 
     GL is available
     AIX Sys V

 or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the
 new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler
 that handles regular expose events eg window managerdriven
 exposures take care of rendering the new image 

Hmmm Clearly  Depends on your programming model  It is not at all
forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event  Certainly any
internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual
appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens
to be generated  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after
updating the datastructures though

Running output

     Try to allocate the color  as 
     After  allocate the color  is 

After XStoreColor XQueryColor just returned the original value 
No failureerror displayed but the contents of colormap are obvious
unchanged I also tried to draw a line using the colors but it 
turned out to be the unmodified colors

So what is my problem How to modify the contents of the colormap

to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors It doesn't happen
for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some
Motif clients

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap
It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors  This makes it look
ugly until it's window gets priority  Then Macx changes the colormap so that
the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications
are having to make do with it's colormap

This is a problem with all color X servers or at least all color Xservers I have
seen when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap
My solution is usually to  avoid colormapgreedy apps and  display
applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather
than in color if this is an option for the application

	Hi I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager
place the window where the create window command tells it
regardless of what it may think is right my application has
reason to know better

	I don't want to set the overrideredirect because I do
want all the embellishments that the window manager gives I just
want the wm to accept my choice of location

	I've tried twm tvtwm and mwm and they are all
uncooperative

	Thanks
	 Ethan

 For some reason the following code causes my X application to beep whenever I
 intercept a keystroke and change it's meaning  The intent of this code it to
 allow date fields the following special keys
 
 	Tt	Insert today's date
 		Bump day up by one
 		Bump day down by one
 
 I hardcoded some dates for this example  Perhaps I shouldn't be using an
 XmText field for this
 
  
  
  For some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys
  of Tt are hit  Why  The idea of this code is to interpret these
  keys having the special meaning implied by the code  I would like to get
  rid of the beeping but as far as I can tell I'm not doing the beep and 
  am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring
  
  

code deleted

From the XmTextField man page during discussion of resources

   XmNverifyBell

      Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
      during a verification callback

You are setting doit to false in the callback and TextField is beeping
as it should  To turn off this behavior set this boolean resource to false

 nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered
 
 Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
 Xlib graphics  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item
 to be drawn in the Window  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea 
 or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new
 item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
 regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care
 of rendering the new image  Using an expose event handler is a proper way
 to do this because at the time the handler is called the Xlib Window is
 guaranteed to be mapped
 
 The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
 is already visible and mapped  What we need to do is somehow tickle the
 Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
 it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item
 
 What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior

If I understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send
exposures to your manager widget when your appspecific code draws xlib
graphics on the window

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using
XSendEvent and specifying a region If you know the region you need to
send the exposure generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects
you can use XCreateRegion to create a region XUnionRectWithRegion to add the
new object polygons to the region and then either use the region
to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your
other objects need to be redrawn Keeping in mind that the stacking order
of overlapping objects affects how they look

Hope it helps

What does this have to do with my original question  I previously

a problem with expose events it has to do with XCopyPlane not
working

Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
XCopyPlane works  This would be very helpful

 I want to do the equivalent of an xwininfo name via a call or set of calls
 in Xlib  I need to map a windows name to its id
 It's probably easy but I've only been programming in X for a little while

Do you have the X source code  Simply look in mitclientsxwininfoxwininfoc and you

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
came from a simple opendrawquit client  

As per your question why not have the button handler add the object and
then call the windowredraw or whatever directly  Although depending
on how the overall application is structured there may be no problem with
rendering the object directly in response to the button press

I bring up X server using 'startx' and usrbinXXsun The following sequence

to X server lost

    xinit  Xsun
    start mwm
    start a client with a dpidpi font
    move the window by dragging the title bar

The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE One of the two messages is printed

I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself

Next I ran xdm in debug level   After the same set of actions xdm reports

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubberband
boxes in MotifX  I'm running on an bit display for which I've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget  a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed

Currently to draw interactively I begin with

    drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground 
    mydefaultbgcolor is the color index for the background of my image 
   palettecolorsdrawIndexred    palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorred
   palettecolorsdrawIndexgreen  palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorgreen
   palettecolorsdrawIndexblue   palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorblue
   XStoreColors myDisplay mycmap palettecolorsDrawIndex 
   XFlush myDisplay

   XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXxor
   XSetForeground myDisplay gc drawIndex

Then to draw I do

   XDrawLine myDisplay XtWindow drawingArea gc x y x y
   XFlush myDisplay

And when I'm all done to return things to normal I do

   XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXcopy


What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever I'm drawing over  Instead what happens is I get white lines  If
the lines are over a white background  nothing shows up  If the lines are
over a black area  nothing shows up  It's very strange  But the GXxor
function seems right  since if I do a rubberbanding box it erases and
redraws itself correctly ie not disturbing the underlying image

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong


I believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground of
the GC to be foregroundbackground

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's

not using XtAppMainLoop but am dealing with events via sockets  ya ya

Anyway I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widgets will
call their get value callback  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this or any way for that matter let me know  I cannot or I don't think
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc XtPointer calldata  

In other words I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself

Any ideas anyone

 	Hi I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager
 place the window where the create window command tells it
 regardless of what it may think is right my application has
 reason to know better
 
 	I don't want to set the overrideredirect because I do
 want all the embellishments that the window manager gives I just
 want the wm to accept my choice of location

	window  XCreateWindow
	XSetTransientForHintdisplay window window
	XMapWindow

This is probably cheating and some window managers might STILL refuse to 
give it a border and all that other stuff but it usually works

 We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to 
be a very useful tool I've been impressed with the level of integration it
affords using the connection editor I love the general ease of use
 
 I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide  Motif She was very
helpful We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next
version of DevGuide Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments I mentioned
I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional
comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into 
 
 Send your commentswishlist raving et al about DevGuide to

 Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want More of this
and computers may have a future

 Frankly I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability
to DOEDOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability pointed out in March's 
SunExpert magazine 

 Technology works we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide Price is 
outstanding

Any ideas Is it a Motif problemare the DEC and Apollo versions of Motif
incompatible Or something to do with XKeysymDB

xterms run fine on DEC displaying on Apolloarggh

I need to run dxterm because the package we are using on the DEC's Oracle Case
uses dxterm by default and we have a lab of Apollo workstations we would like
to run Oracle from

posted for a friend

Okay I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this but I know its
come up before

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order
    Try to find an exact match readonly color cell within hardware limits
    Try to allocate a readonly colorcell and set it to match
	and when all else fails 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the readonly colors 
    already allocated in the colormap

This sounds good in theory  It doesn't seem to work this way
though  If there is no exact match already in the colormap and 
no unallocated cells then XAllocColor fails even when it has 
already allocated several other cells already and there are dozens 
of readonly cells already in the colormap

Is this a bug  A feature  A misunderstanding on my part

Any help appreciated

Does XDM work with DECnet I have an Ultrix machine running both TCPIP
and DECnet I have a number of Xterminals hanging off the Ultrix host also
running TCPIP and DECnet Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure
on the Xterminals using TCPIP Since XDM is basically just an Xwindows
client shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well

My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client It is making
TCPIP specific socket calls In this case the answer would be no you can
not run XDM over DECnet Is this right or not Any feedback is appreciated

CALL FOR VOTES creation of compwindowssuit

A Request For Discussion was posted on  Mar  and both charter
and group name have been accepted

Charter


What is SUIT


SUIT provides a standard library of screen components buttons menus
sliders etc and allows interactive layout and specification of user
interfaces  The user interface to a SUIT program is editable even while
the application runs  Programs using SUIT are written in ANSIC  SUIT
runs on UNIXX Color Macintosh DOS and Windows  a single application
source file may be recompiled to run on all platforms

SUIT was designed to be easy to learn  we view it as the Pascal of UI
toolkits  Learning from a page written tutorial our undergraduates
have been able to use SUIT productively after  hours  This is possible
because we rely more heavily on interactive tools than previous toolkits
and because the entire system as been designed to be easy to learn

SUIT's biggest advantages are
	 it runs across a very wide variety of hardware platforms
	 it has a documented  hour learning curve for beginners
	 it's very lightweight relatively small amount of code

SUIT has now been distributed to thousands of sites and has reached
all continents but Antarctica It has also been used in graduate
courses at some universities including Stanford

The suitusers mailing list now has nearly  participants and has
message traffic of  per day Some users have unsubcribed already
citing the volume of mail as the main reason We feel that this
justifies a newsgroup

Details of the newsgroup


compwindowssuit will be an unmoderated forum that will handle all
aspects of SUIT including

	 questions about SUIT
	 bug reports
	 distribution of contributory code
	 announcement of new releases

Voting


Voting will begin when this CFV is posted and will end on May  
at  EST In order for the group to be created there must be a 
majority of yes votes to no votes and there must be  more yes votes
than no votes

initially will be rejected No anonymous votes will be accepted
If you wish to change your vote mail a new vote only the most recent
vote by a user will be counted

If you have problems questions or comments please mail them to

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux SLS Release with kernel  and am running into some
problems  Actually it seems that this is more of a GCC question
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS
	Basically there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in let's say CompositePh for instance the composite
widget's insertchild procedure is set up with the type 

	typedef void XtWidgetProc Widget

but in several places in the HP source code they reference the
insertchild procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one as the prototype suggests  For example

	superclasscompositeclassinsertchildw args pnumargs

Now GCC chokes on this giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function  So does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing usrincludeXCompositePh
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions
	Many thanks in advance for any help

I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR  an SVR  box
running XFree  to my NCD XDisplay  It's pretty much working but
I'm encountering a weird error  I'm attempting to start an xterm from
my xsession file but nothing happens  Redirecting stderr to a file
using 'exec HOMExerrors' in xsession reveals the error message

  xterm Error  errno  Not owner

Now if I start xterm from the window manager or from the command line
it works fine  And starting other clients like the window manager mwm
and a clock from my xsession also works

Anyone encountered this  Suggestions

I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being 
clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif I have reprogrammed
the F key to transmit a ff be character sequence by using the
following line in Xdefaults

Ctrl Shift Alt Key F  stringxff stringxbe n

I merge in this line with xrdb merge and then create the new xterm
which has the remapped F key The problem that arises is that the 
application which is recieving input at the time only sees a f e
sequence which is ff be with the high order bit of each
character being filtered or ignored

When I run xev and press the F key I get the correct value showing 
up in the following two key events

  KeyPress event serial  synthetic NO window x
  root x subw x time   root
  state x keycode  keysym xffbe F samescreen YES
  XLookupString gives  characters  

  KeyRelease event serial  synthetic NO window x
  root x subw x time   root
  state x keycode  keysym xffbe F samescreen YES
  XLookupString gives  characters  

Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct xffbe
But when I use the F key while in vi or in a program I wrote to 
spit back the hex values of keyboard input I only get f e

Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
I can do to make sure that the entire bits make it through to
the final application Any help is greatly appreciated

Please email any responses

  Yes it's possible in fact there's some gl widget code in
usrlppGL somewhere it's named Glibc my IBM's down right now
though so I can't find the exact location 

  WARNING this code feels quite bogus It does things like calling
noport before winopen and then extracting an X window id from it
anyway It worked just fine under aix  I spent last weekend trying
to port it to  gl under  doesn't seem to like it and it's
turning into a Hard Job

  Check out your info pages it has some pretty good documentation on
whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X and how to go about
doing so

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order
    Try to find an exact match readonly color cell within hardware limits
    Try to allocate a readonly colorcell and set it to match
	and when all else fails 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the readonly colors 
    already allocated in the colormap

Where did you hear this  If it is printed in a book somewhere
throw away the book  According to the MIT specs only the first

 I am developing an X XtXm application that will include a graphics window
 of some sort with moving symbols among other things  A pure X application
 could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an 
 XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib  But I would like to take advantage of
 the Graphics Library GL available on our IBM RS SGI's GL i believe
 
 Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program
 Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
 with XOpenWindow

There is a widget already defined for GL  It is the GlxMDraw motif or
GlxDraw athena widget  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window  Look at glxlink
glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man pages

 I have never used GL before but the doc on GL winopen says that the first
 time winopen is called it opens a connection to the server   Also most of
 the GL calls do not require a Display or GC unlike most X calls  From this
 initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily   Is this
 true

The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well  OpenGL will be an improvement

 Does PEX graPHIGS have the same functionality of GL

I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful but
that's just an opinion  Mileage may vary

 nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered
 
 Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that
 contains
 Xlib graphics  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item
 to be drawn in the Window  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea
  or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the
 new
 item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that
 handles
 regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care
 of rendering the new image  Using an expose event handler is a proper
 way
 to do this because at the time the handler is called the Xlib Window is
 guaranteed to be mapped
 
 The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
 is already visible and mapped  What we need to do is somehow tickle the
 Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
 it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item
 
 What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior

To incrementally update the contents of windows I use the following trick

	 Set the window background to None
	 Call XClearAreadisplay window     True
	 Restore the window background to its correct value

The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background but still
generates exposure events for visible parts of the window

In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled
incrementally something is already displayed on the screen and may need to
be erased I encapsulate the  operations with  self addressed client
messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server

XGrabServerdisplay
client message startincremental
 	background None
	XClearArea
	Restore background 
client message endincremental
XUngrabServerdisplay

The GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the
critical section

    Actually I must also ask the FAQ's  most popular reason why graphics
    don't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
    rectangle
 
 Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
 Xlib graphics  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item
 to be drawn in the Window  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea 
 or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new
 item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
 of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
 Window is mapped
 
 The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
 is visible and mapped  Do you know the best way to tickle a window so
 that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item
 
 
 What does this have to do with my original question  I previously
 stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth pixmap to the screen
 just to make sure that my image had data and it did  This is NOT
 a problem with expose events it has to do with XCopyPlane not
 working
 
 Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
 XCopyPlane works  This would be very helpful
 
 Thanks

What it has to do with your original question is this many times 
beginning X users heck experienced X users too write small test
programs  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's
graphics show up and sometimes they don't  We're just trying to
eliminate all the easy explanations  for why you're not seeing your
graphics 

That being said why don't you try copying different planes to your
window other than       Try     
to see it you get any output  Since you're dipslaying only a single 
plane of your data it's possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane

Hi

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list

  I am new to X so please excuse my lax read probably incorrect
terminology

  Environment Sun Sparc  SunOs   XR path level   My X process
is started by xdm

  i I want to setup the backgroud root window of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc grey is a very boring colour to work on

     The setup is as follows

        libXxdmXsetup       xsetroot bitmap  etc
        userxsession            xsetroot  etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also tvtwmrc and Xdefaults files in the user home
     directory

     The xsetroot in Xsetup displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected  very nice

     Unfortunately when the users session is started the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey  If I manually type xsetroot in an
     xterm window when the session has started the background is changed as
     expected

     The question is How do I retain the background from the login window
     andor specify a new background on a peruser basis as part of the
     the users session startup

 ii When I open an Xterm on the Sparc  not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters

     ie real key       key shown on screen
            
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying  Is X at fault here or the machine setup  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with XR in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm  as
     expected

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated

  Thanks

Dave

Hi
  Environment Sun Sparc  SunOs   XR path level   My X process

Okay that's good  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup
USUNIX layout keyboard  I did install the sunkbd patch though

  i I want to setup the backgroud root window of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc grey is a very boring colour to work on

Make sure you're using ssetroot which comes with tvtwm  When tvtwm
starts up it nukes the existing root window  Use an ssetroot after
tvtwm starts up   You could spawn off a sleep  ssetroot 
You can also use VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey

 ii When I open an Xterm on the Sparc  not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters

Did you install the sunkbd patch  It's in the contrib directory on export
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly except the following
The End PageUp PageDown on the key cluster aren't recognized
Even the compose key works  Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed

Anyone have a fix for the last two

Dear SGI and netter GLX MixedModel experts
I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different
color maps for different windows and I've been having trouble getting
the window manager to reliably honor my requests  In some environments
entry level R Indigo w  all windows are getting properly
connected to their designated color maps but on others an IRIS D GTX
also a different entry level Indigo the color mapping is unreliable
and changes behavior when I compile at different times  The most common
problem is that all nontoplevel windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap  My application starts out by creating three toplevel
windows in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap  This is spectacularly aggravating

I would dearly appreciate
   an explanation of the standard RIGHT CORRECT way to give a window
  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it

   any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my
  desired colormaps

By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this having tried everything
reasonable or imaginable

Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been TRYING
to do this  Please please please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing

Hello Netlanders

       I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod

       My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows

       DXRAM  running Esix  
       Wangtek ATstyle interface  M tape drive
       I have loaded the Basic OS which includes nsu and
       inet utilities tcpip
       I ftped the XFree XR binaries and installed properly
 
 I can execute startx and run Xwindows with no problems
 However if I try to access the tape drive while in X the
 machine locks up instantly  If I am out of X and access the
 tape the tape drive works fine  Soon as I try to
 startx again the screen changes modes but the grey background
 pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked  I have to login
 from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system

 I've contacted Esix about this problem  They claim THEIR Xwindow XR
 server which I have works with the Wangtek tape drive  They also 
 claim I only need the nsu network system utilities to run X I don't
 need inet tcpip  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get
 XFree to work  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet
 packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem

 I would like to get both X and my tape drive to coexist on the same
 system  If you can shed any light on the problem it would be appreciated
 
 One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict  If this is true
 what direction should I look to resolve the conflict 

 Thanks

According to the OSFMotif Style Guide one should use cursor shapes to give
the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him So
a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy or a
caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in
another Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level
So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain
subpart of it is a rather complicated matter When cursors have been defined
for some windows eg a crosswire cursor for a DrawingArea things get even
more complicated My intuition says that things should be easier but is this
so If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me
know The topics on busy cursors in the several FAQ's are not helpful since
they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window
attribute set to 'None'

but can I tell from the string

If the client is executing on host foo then  unix foo

local is also a valid display name a shared memory connection
maybe  Are there other strings that I should check for  Is there a

Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to
run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office

Many thanks for all replies the majority of people  recommended
PCXremote from NCD I received it yesterday  and installed it on
my Sparc and PC with only one hitch 
The UNIX install consists of copying  files into some local bin directory 
On the PC side I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows
installation


The only problem I had was that  my xinitrc  in my home directory
had the line
DISPLAYhostname export DISPLAY

st the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console
By removing this line from the xinitrc everything worked as planned
and the clients connected to the server at

hostname

Some comments on performance I was connected to a Sparc  thru
a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a  baud line
My PC is a DX ATI Ultra  MB

Bitmap Stuff Sucked
Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable
Xmail was very usable

At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was
a very noticable delay I put this down to brain damaged WINDOWS
should not be called a SCHEDULER besides that this will become
my remote work environment for a while

Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product the sales
person said they performed about the same given the over head of
WINDOWS I question this

many thanks for help to all who responded

The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common
GUI But what does this mean exactly 

 Do they mean that all COSEcomplient apps will have the Motif
  look and feel

 Do they mean that all COSEcomplient apps will use the Motif
  toolkit API

 Do they mean both of the above

 Is it possible that there will be a MotifAPI complient toolkit with
  an OpenLook Look  Feel

 How about an OLITXViewOIInterviews API toolkit with a Motif L  F
  I know OI already does this but will this be considered COSEcomplient

 Will there be more than one standard toolkit API or L  F supported

 How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif

This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much 
knowledge about these questions off the net Feel free to email
or followup

The situation running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronicsmode Xterm for displaying some graphics  Typing a RET while
the Tektronicsmode Xterm future reference to this will be Tekterm is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tekterm stays the highlighted color and that the Tekterm stays on top of
Xterm  If what I'm describing isn't input focus let me know  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics but does not move 
the Tekterm to the top  If the Tekterm has been iconized to conserve 
screen space it stays an icon


The desired behavior one of two options  

     Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one

     Whenever the Tekterm is inactivated it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm

What I think I need a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tekterm will
be at the highest level and a way to iconifyexpand a Xterm and Tekterm
These commands would I'd guess need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tekterm

Other information All this is taking place on a VT a DEC dumb 
Xwindows terminal connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif

Thanks for your time  If you've got any words of wisdom other than 
give up  please send email to

  XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib  But I would like to take advantage of

  Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program
  Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me

You can't make GL calls in an XmDrawingArea widget for sure  
 
 There is a widget already defined for GL  It is the GlxMDraw motif or
 GlxDraw athena widget  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea except that it
 allows you to use GL calls to render into the window  Look at glxlink
 glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man pages
 
 
 The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well  OpenGL will be an improvement

I can vouch for that The GL Widget works pretty well I have been using it
for sometime now I'm not sure though whether you can use Xlib calls to draw
into the GL widget I haven't tried it yet nor have I read the accompanying
documentation completely Try posting to compsyssgi for more information
Better stillyou will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals  there
is a little transition guide which explains the mixedmodel programming
paradigmMixing X and GL

  Does PEX graPHIGS have the same functionality of GL
 
 I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful but
 that's just an opinion  Mileage may vary

Well PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but 
then it is buggy to start with  opinions again

  Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me
  
  Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
  of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've
  finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
  I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage
  is considerably slower factor of  on average than the
  Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
  pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
   the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
   XPutImage is inefficientor both
 
 Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the
 destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead
 of transporting through whatever clientserver communications
 mechanism you are using
 
 Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps
 These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is
 much cheaper
 
 Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running
 in XSynchonize mode

  If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server MITSHM
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS
  A word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory And another word of warning OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server
  I have written an imaging tool using XView for the GUI by the way which
  yields over  frames per second for  bit images running on a Sparc
  IPC half the cpu grunt of an IPX This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations

 Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
 I can do to make sure that the entire bits make it through to
 the final application Any help is greatly appreciated
 

 You need these resources

Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see
if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could but the
server did not create cursors of that size Investigation showed that some X
servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while
others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size The interesting thing
to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware 
a Sun with a cg will claim cursors up to root window size are OK while a
Sun with a cg will stop at x So far I've also seen this behavior on
NCD and PhaseX X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs 
Actually the NCD is even more liberal  sizes much larger then the root
winodw are gladly returned as OK Is XQueryBestCursor semibroken or is this
behavior correct I'd really like to see a x cursor

Does XDM work with DECnet I have an Ultrix machine running both TCPIP
and DECnet I have a number of Xterminals hanging off the Ultrix host also
running TCPIP and DECnet Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure
on the Xterminals using TCPIP Since XDM is basically just an Xwindows
client shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well


XDM is not just an X Window client  XDM has its own protocol XDMCP that
operates of UCP on port   It does provide a Login window which is an
X Window Client  As to using DECnet protocol  Looking through the source
for XDM from XR that I have here it seems that the bare bones code is
there but not completely there


My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client It is making
TCPIP specific socket calls In this case the answer would be no you can
not run XDM over DECnet Is this right or not Any feedback is appreciated
Thanks


From my look at the source it seems you cannot run it over DECnet as shipped
with XR

Dear Xperts

I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select
an image file out of a directory Now I would like to display the
name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale
button ie with the MB pressed As XmNshowValue only displays
the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding
image file name I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do
the mapping between the scale value and the file name

XtAddEventHandlerscaleImageButtonMotionMask  FALSE SliderMoved NULL


and in the eventhandler do a

  while XCheckTypedWindowEvent display eventwindow MotionNotify Return
   
  XmScaleGetValuescaleImagevalue
  map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open


However when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks with of co
   urse
a null effect as my MB is not pressed to move the scale button So what is goin
   g wrong
Or is the a wrong approach to this problem
Any hints are highly appreciated

 Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of
 free memory available to the Xserver

No  Even if you could the answer could be out of date even before you
get it even if you grab the server it could be taken up by buffering
user actions  You should just try to do whatever you want a BadAlloc
error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available

I am trying to build and use imake XR on an IBM RS running AIX V
I am having the following  problems

 Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
                This is a makefile
        at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
        preprocessor and into the Makefile  Most of the C preprocessors that
        I have used will not treat such a  as appearing at the start of the
        line  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
        start of a directive 

        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
        as the start of a directive  The cpp fails when it determines
        that This is not a known directive  I have temporarily hacked my
        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
        fix

 Several Imakefiles use  as a parameter to a macro when a particular
        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter  The AIX cpp
        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate
information about on your solutions  Perhaps this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed  Also do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly

Since I do not have easy access to News a response to
'whitebillypogisprccom' would be appreciated

The new ftp address will be clrnmsuedu the current IP address
is  but may change so use clrnmsuedu whenever
possible

Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crlnmsuedu and

not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research

The Arabic Chinese French Italian Indian Japanese Korean
Tibetan and Vietnamese archives will all be moved

We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved

Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crlnmsuedu or clrnmsuedu  It will take a few days to move
everything

If you are not familiar with our multilingual archives we have been
slowly collecting various software fonts and text for different
languages over the past  years  Most of the software is currently
Unix oriented  We would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
quantity of multilingual tools

  I have a Sun  that has a mono framebuffer bwtwo  built on the
  motherboard  The same system also has a cgfour cgfour and bwtwo 
  daughterboard  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a
  color front screen from the cgfour and a mono back screen from the
  bwtwo both on the same tube  I recentley picked up a  x  Sun mono
  monitor and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour and
  the bwtwo  I do not care if I loose the back screen on the color tube
  from the bwtwo  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if
  this is possible  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before

If it's any consolation I have two headed Sun systems though the
color and mono monitors for each are rated x   Their configuration
is the same as yours so it should be a Plug'N'Play situation EXCEPT

I don't know if your hires mono monitor will function this way  However
you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HIRES jumper
located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAMSIMM selects
and Ethernet connection and be happily on your way  When you pull the
motherboard the jumpers are in the leftrear eg northwest quadrant
of the motherboard to the left of the SIMM sockets

 Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me
 
 Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
 I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage
 is considerably slower factor of  on average than the
 Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
  the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
  XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what
 is the fastest way in XR to dump  plane image data to
 a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
 running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
 XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now
 
 All help appreciatedthanks

Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
server resident Pixmaps using XPutImage  Once this is done the original XImages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable

Hope this is helpfull

A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set
up an X app multiple times  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize should
never be called more than once  This helped  However I am still having
some problems  Below is a new little test program that more closely models
my real program  In the actual program I am writing a library callable
from any other program  This means that the first time the lib function is
called it must initialize things and after that it should just use the
old stuff still around because of static variables  In the demo below
main represents the main program calling my library and doit represents
the interface to the library function

The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created
It is still on the screen  unusuable  during the sleep in the main prog
despite the XtDestroyWidget call

Anyone see something I'm missing

I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply and now we
have another bug report on the same subject Can anybody help me out

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case  What I want is CtrlO and Ctrlo to both be accelerators on one
menu entry

In ORA Vol  in the section on accelerators it says For information
on how to specify translation tables see Vol  this is so you
know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource  If you go to
Vol  it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well For
example the translation

	ShiftKeyq	quit

will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key and the q key

This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to CtrlKeyo should do
what I want but it doesn't it doesn't work if the user presses the
control key the shift key and the o key

Is it possible to supply   accelerator for a menu entry Keep in
mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use
XtInstallAccelerators

I am using Motif  on a DECstation  but I have also tried it
on an HP using Motif  and

ftp'ed them to a system I have access to  I then used kermit to transmit
them via modem to my host computer a PCbased file system  I access
internet through modem access to a university mainframe  From the PC
file server I pull the files to a disk and then pull them from disk
to a SGI Indigo the SGI is not networked yet  When I try to uncompress
and untar the files they either come out as garbage or I get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid
What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files compressed
binaryascii about multiple platforms  My guess is that it is the copy
to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up  Any help is appreciated

left and right boundary lines have many pixels on a given scanline What 
are the rules concerning abutting polygonsAre they the same as the 
joinstyle in the GC 

I've read the X pixelization rule but how does the X server determine the 
center point of a pixel Is there any support for shadingcolor interpolation

Can someone point me to a definitive book that discusses these issues

 I am developing an X XtXm application that will include a graphics window
 of some sort with moving symbols among other things  A pure X application
 could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an 
 XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib  But I would like to take advantage of
 the Graphics Library GL available on our IBM RS SGI's GL i believe

 Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program
 Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
 with XOpenWindow

In SGI's distribution with their Indigo line others as well possibly
they include source code for a GL widget that fits on top of Motif and
one that's Xt based as well  You may wish to ask IBM whether they
support this

I have two questions well probably more about how Expose  Configure
events are handled

I have an appl which uses  window to draw in  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized I made a translation table for the Expose  Configure events
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose
event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate Expose struct
to draw the data

Quest 
When the appl is compiledlinked w R running in either R or R env
I get multiple  redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed  I assume I'm getting cascading events  Is that right
Any suggestions as to how to handletrap events in a better way

Quest 
When the appl is compiledlinked w R I get no Expose events
whatsoever  Do events andor translation tables act differently in R

Thanks in advance

Subject finding out state of state keys eg CapsLock and NumLock

Hi  I've looked in the FAQ and the OReilly books and was unable to
find an easy means of finding out the state of state keys such as
CapsLock and NumLock  I can certainly track the events inside of my
window and set a boolean there but what if CapsLock is pressed in
another window  I looked at XGrabKey and decided it was definitely
NOT what I wanted to do  I could find no convenience function to tell
me that information

My question is this  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock andor NumLock is

An even more pointed question Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard  ie CapsLock is active and the user
presses shifta I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'

Any input is greatly appreciated Please respond via email  I will
repost a summary of my findings

			Thanks Ralph

store and reply of mouse and keyboard events


To produce regression tests or automatic demo's
we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events
produced by a user It should be possible to filter
the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue
an to store them in a file
This sequence of events stored in a file should be given 
to the server's queue as if a user is working


 Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all
   mouse and keyboard events where

 Where one can catch these events to store them 
   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal HP
   Where can we catch all events coming from a given
   server
   If this is not possible can we catch all events given
   to a certain client and how 
   
 Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user 
   Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages
   all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it 


Thanks in advance

Ron

Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage
is considerably slower factor of  on average than the
Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
 XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what
is the fastest way in XR to dump  plane image data to
a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now

All help appreciatedthanks

Derek

      Try change the GXxor to GXequiv  I have to do this for programs that

There is a small section in the O'Reilly Xlib books that describes

GC to the OR of the foreground and background pixel values

Hello

This is my first net letter so forgive mistakes

I have been plagued by problems or lack of info with
authorization in Open Windows  for a long while and
would like some help please  I generally use strait
MIT X and so don't use OW much but when I share 
X software with others  bad news

PROBLEM

My friend who logs into his SSII trys to run my 
program that runs fine on my machine however 
my friend gets client not authorized to connect 
to server or something close  If OW is started
with the noauth option all is well but surely this
is not required in general

Also xhost  does not work becoming root does not 
work etc 

Any help will be greatly appreciated

Thanx

I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments
such as the geometry option Since this is a standard X option 
I'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there
is some predefined function that will do this for me


If you are using the Intrinsics it is parsed for you  If you are working
at the Xlib level you can parse it yourself or you can use the following
bit of code

static XrmOptionDescRec options  
	geometry	geometry	XrmoptionSepArg XPointerNULL


define Numberx	sizeofxsizeofx
XrmParseCommanddb options Numberoptions MyApplication argc argv

Then use XrmGetResource to retrieve the value and parse it using
XParseGeometry

It is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv however I much prefer
using the X resource management routines to do this

Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the
destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead
of transporting through whatever clientserver communications
mechanism you are using

Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps
These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is
much cheaper

Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running
in XSynchonize mode

What it may think is right may be exactly what the user wants
Assuming that your application has reason to know better is IMHO
antisocial  If I start your application with a geometry option are
you going to ignore that as well

There's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything
if it's managing your window  You can ask you can hint but there's
no guarantee that you're going to get what you want

Some window managers do very different things besides positioning the window

Hi there netters

I require a window to appear at a coordinates  top left corner of my
screen root window Could some windows guru out there help me on how to
go about doing this I write the whole program which creates the window with
the image it displays  I require the image to appear at the topleft corner
so that I can grab it for recording on to video using a MIniVas controller
which expects the window at the same spot every time

Thanks in advance

sincerely

Sanjeev Sharma

I just had an idea I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just
remembering it unconsiously but I thought that in dialog
boxes and whatever in windowing systems there should be a
way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or
filled in a certain way My idea tape You know like putting
a piece of tape over a light switch
Just an idea if you like it use it

again poseted for a friend

Okay I got such great response from my last question thanks everyone 
lets try again

How can I tell if a colorcell is readonly

I want to use any readonly cells that are already in my colormap
once I start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary
nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to
a requested color

Once I determine if a cell is readonly I assume I can then just request
an XAllocColor with the exact same color specifications and it will 
then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get
freed by someone else and allocated again as readwrite to another
application

So far the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own
error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my
colormap is all full up  It should error out if the cell is nonshareable
But life would be much easier if I could just detect the
readonlyshareable stuff directly

Any ideas

Hello

I wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question
I am a total X novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have

I am trying to create a simple drawing tool

       
               
            
         
             	   
	     

Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvassee above 
one intersecting the other
Now I would like to delete one of the rectangles
The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the
GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly
created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes
A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel 
locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is 
something that should be avoided

Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other
rectangle too
I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area
as this degrades performance very badly


Thank you
Gopal

 If anyone has any information about the existence or location of a
 dedicated X server kernel for the Sun please send email  I am
 trying to put some neglected Suns to good use but they don't have
 enough memory for SunOS   Thanks in advance for any help

	There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that
It is by Seth Robertson sethctrcolumbiaedu  It takes a sun  and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X  We converted 
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
 I find them faster than an NCD inch blackwhite XTerminal that we
are playing with and a bigger screen to boot  As a matter of fact
the department just bought some old suns at an auction to convert

 Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftpctrcolumbiaedu
  in XkernelXkernelshar Xkernel is a symlink to the
 latest version of Xkernel

	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun  but compiling to work for a sun xx should be quite easy

	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user   I may be able to answer questions feel free
to email me

Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage
is considerably slower factor of  on average than the
Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
 XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what
is the fastest way in XR to dump  plane image data to
a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now

All help appreciatedthanks

 Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
 server resident Pixmaps using XPutImage  Once this is done the original XImages
 can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable
 
 Hope this is helpfull

I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display
rates  xx frames  sec on IPX that I get with Sunview though
it's a bit choppy at times Also loading the data making an XImage
then XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome so the animation is
slower to load than with Sunview Is there a better way to load in the
data

rgoochrpCSIROAU Richard Gooch writes
  If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server MITSHM
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS
  A word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory And another word of warning OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server
  I have written an imaging tool using XView for the GUI by the way which
  yields over  frames per second for  bit images running on a Sparc
  IPC half the cpu grunt of an IPX This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations

				Regards

					Richard Gooch

Shared memory PutImage also mentioned by nkissebedelphibeckmanuiucedu
Nick Kisseberth looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some
documentation Is this method likely to give better results than server
resident pixmaps I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code
mentioned above

Thanks for the help so far If I get something decent put together I'll
definitely post it to the Net

 try this after XCreateWindow
 
 

   xsizehintsflags  USPosition  USSize	 or  PPosition  PSize 
   
   XSetWMNormalHints display window xsizehints
   

 These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
 are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
 values If you use xsizehintsflags  PPosition  PSize this tells the window
 manager that the values are prefered values of the program not the user
 I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer
 if you specify the position and size like above

Sorry but olwm and tvtwm don't do it They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later

Currently my solution is

	XCreateWindow
	XSetWMProperties
	XMapWindow
	XFlush
	XMoveWindow


It works with olwm but is less than elegant All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious

Usually when I start up an application I first get the window outline
on my display I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen Yet when I specify the geometry 
option the window appears right away the properties specified by
the geometry argument The question now is

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick I've tried explicitly setting window

Thanks for any hints

 Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
 I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage
 is considerably slower factor of  on average than the
 Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
  the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
  XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what

The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server
memory this is the hog The conversions in the XPutImage are
fast

 is the fastest way in XR to dump  plane image data to
 a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
 running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with

Yes by utilizing the MITSHM extension that provides an XPutImage
derivate that uses shared memory Fine fast

 XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now
 

No You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps thus moving
them to server memory and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea
BUT be aware this is a major server memory bummer

   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation
When he first logs on via xdm he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running  In this configuration X windows
applications particularly xdvi work fine  However if he opens up a
second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window
giving the error Unable to load ISO  font

   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the Xsession file with prettier
colours and other slight changes  Further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant ALL
X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window  If I start the xterm with a different
font using the fn option no problems  It would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts  Note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font
directorieshashtables

   Other than rewriting the XTerm appdefaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas

More info  This is the most recent MIPS workstation R I believe
       with the most current operating system and running XR
       It is not mwm's fault as the same problems occur under twm etc

Hello

I am testing a port of XR to Coherent a unix clone OS for Intel architecture
machines  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt a simple
terminal emulator program

The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the
server for display one at a time  The characters appear to be too closely
spaced with the result being that the nd character echoed destroys the 
rightmost edge of the first character then the rd character destroys the 
rightmost edge of the second character and so on  It looks like there is an
invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
character  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns
a complete line of text only when the output is a series of individual
characters

If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where I should look to
find it it would be much appreciated

Regards and thanks Jon Dhuse

In sdennisaacadslbcom sdennisosforg writes

I posted this a while ago and didn't receive one reply and now we
have another bug report on the same subject Can anybody help me out

The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply  Unfortunately
the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined
with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case
Ctrl AnyKeyq

In ORA Vol  in the section on accelerators it says For information
on how to specify translation tables see Vol  this is so you
know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource  If you go to
Vol  it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well For
example the translation
	ShiftKeyq	quit
will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key and the q key

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs it's not true for menu accelerators  If
you're a Motif implementor I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
changed to support the feature I described above  Otherwise change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's
expectations because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
translations

Is it possible to supply   accelerator for a menu entry

If you mean menu accelerator no it's not possible  That's according to
the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page

Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you
can't use XtInstallAccelerators

I can't think of a reason why not

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case  What I want is CtrlO and Ctrlo to both be accelerators on one
menu entry

There is a workaround for Motif users  In addition to the normal menu
accelerator you install on the XmPushButtonGadget set an XtNaccelerators
resource on the shell TopLevel or Application  Install the shell's
accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with
XtInstallAllAccelerators shell shell

For example

  applicationShell  mainWindow  menuBar  fileCascade
					   filePulldown  openPushbutton
							   exitPushbutton

  openPushbuttonaccelerator  CtrlKeyO
  openPushbuttonacceleratorText  CtrlO
  exitPushbuttonaccelerator  CtrlKeyQ
  exitPushbuttonacceleratorText  CtrlQ

  applicationShellaccelerators  overriden
    CtrlKeyO PerformActionopenPushbutton ArmAndActivaten
    CtrlKeyQ PerformActionexitPushbutton ArmAndActivate

You have to write and add the application action PerformAction which you
can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then
XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments

I tested out something similar to this  To shorten development time I
used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators
on the shell and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead
of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me but the more general approach I
described above should work

   If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server
   you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server MITSHM
   xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension This is certainly
   available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS
   A word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared

   I have written an imaging tool using XView for the GUI by the way which

Thanks for docs info It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between
frames and use tvtwm my tests with  xx frames on an IPX using the
serverresident pixmap method give an astonishing  frames per second And
VERY smooth I think I've found the best solution thanks to the generous help
on this group However I may have colormap questions later

 documentation Is this method likely to give better results than server
 resident pixmaps I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code

  There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
XR distribution

  Actually I just finished writing a motif animation program
takelotsofimagedataanddisplayitprettydarnfast When using
onserver pixmaps or shared memory I had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly  Testing both methods side by side they
were just about equal

  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous
sizes but pixmaps can work over a network and are removed if your
application dies one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging SHM apps

  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems eg
Ultrix seem to allow only a small number of segments  to be
attached to a process at once consequently a redraw becomes
XShmAttachXShmPutImageXShmDetach on Dec systems And Dec's 
bit displays like the ones I tend to use most often don't seem to
support the extension maybe someone compiled them wrong and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash failed mallocs so one has to
use the local unix domain socket which really isn't that bad one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one

  In short allowing all three forms of display within the program is a
Good Thing minus SHM if running over a network and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest

  I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it

I consider TWMstyle Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window
manager I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same
time with no overlap and since two windows aren't enough I have
other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning

In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles here's a crude
picture

  Figure  
 
                                  
      title A                     title B            title C 
         
        this is the               window B hides window C but 
          body of the             you can still see C's title  
           window window A       which is squeezed right     
         
 
  Figure  

Squeezed titles allow me to have about  such windows in each stack
with easy access and  per stack is usually more than I really
need since I also insist on having a virtual WM

The only problem is that the title location is static that is  it
is configured in twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit
that file and restart the window manager Doing so is cumbersome and
timeconsuming

Therefore I have implemented fsqueeze left center right 
functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click
of a button you can change this

    
     title A 
    
       this is the          
         body of the        
          window window A  
    

to this

                   
                    title A 
    
       this is the          
         body of the        
          window window A  
    

 

Okay So far so good Now how the heck do I get them to put this
into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm
and the next ctwm And the next xyztwm that I never heard of

One way would be to post in compwindowsx a description of this
enhancement together with an explanation of why I think it is a
Very Good Thing and hope that someone reads it 

In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing
look back up at Figure  and picture window A moved over on top of
windows B and C now window A's title hides Window B's title
but when you hit fsqueezecenter the result is

              
         title B     title A     title C 
        
           this is the body of the window   
           window A which is on top        
        

 

The rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my
XR copy of vtvwmshar it's just a sketch because posting the
full diffs would be too long

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the
ExecuteFunction routine in menusc

ifdef SHAPE
	case FSQUEEZELEFT
		static SqueezeInfo leftsqueeze   JLEFT   
		if DeferExecution context func ScrSelectCursor
		  return TRUE

		tmpwinsqueezeinfo  leftsqueeze
		SetFrameShape tmpwin 
		break
	
	 and similarly for squeezeright  JRIGHT  and
	squeezecenter  JCENTER  
endif

 Of course you also have to define FSQUEEZELEFT in parseh
  and add
     fsqueezeleft FKEYWORD FSQUEEZELEFT 
      and so forth 
to parsec

In order to use these functions add something like the
following to your twmrc file

Button  m  s  wvdritdoor  fsqueezecenter

 

About a year ago I posted this but our news was broken and I
think it didn't get out

Since then blast has appeared in compsourcesx Volume 
Issue  you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by
chiseling away at an mwmstyle wide title Better to have a
twmstyle window manager I think

 Nick Kisseberth looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some
 documentation Is this method likely to give better results than server
 resident pixmaps I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code

There is no easy answer to this question it depends on whether the display
device can hold pixmaps in offscreen memory and if so how efficiently
the server manages these resources having to deal with limited offscreen
memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence  

I have worked with graphics devices where the offscreen memory to 
main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy
rate and with those where the main memory to display is faster than
offscreen to display requires only a write to the framebuffer rather
than a read of the FB followed by a write

If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into
pixmaps in CPU main memory the rates you can get through MITSHM are
likely to be equal maybe a tad slower depending on your OS's implementation
of shared memory to CopyArea from pixmap to window which is also then
just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device

One advanage of MITSHM is that if your images are large you don't end up
growing the size of the server process to hold them

One disadvantage of the MITSHM is that in its sample implementation
there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
if the client dies a sudden violent death eg kill  You have to 
be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments

 Hi Xperts
   I have a Sparc with very limited disk space on usr partition
   previously i was able to run all xwindows applications  and then 
   i upgraded my system to sun os  and realized that  the hard
disk did not have enough space to load openwindows My immediate alternative
was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system This resulted in
not loading openwindows As a result of which none of the Xlibraries got loaded

   I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and binX files 
required for running Xwindows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw
In a desperate effort to regain xwindows i retrieved usrliblibX files from
the tape  usrbinX  and usrincludeX  Is this enough for running Xwindows
 
 BUt i did not get usrlibXfonts  sub directories  these are mainly dpi dpi
 and misc 

when i run xinit the error message says usrlibXfontsdpi etc are not in the
default path But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no
disk space 
Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a  GB disk and load openwindows  to
just have my xwindows running 

Thanks

Pramod

Can anyone give me some information please 

I need probably to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HPUX
platform Do I need the Motif private header files and source
or can I make do with the public headers that are provided
Motif includes Xt in this context

One widget is a multicolumn list which lots of people have
already written I am sure and would therefore be probably be
a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class
Is this more difficult in principle not lines of code

Alternatively if anyone has a multicolumn list widget they
could sell me this might save me from having to write one
Does it by any chance exist in Motif  already I do not
yet have the spec

Answers appreciated

  These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window

  I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer
  if you specify the position and size like above
 
 Sorry but olwm and tvtwm don't do it They place the title at that position
 and the window at a position below it

The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested
is because that's what the ICCCM says they should do

 This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
 configuration and restore is later
 
 Currently my solution is
 
 	XCreateWindow
 	XSetWMProperties
 	XMapWindow
 	XFlush
 	XMoveWindow

This code will almost certainly break  Calling XMapWindow and then
XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager  Even if this did work there isn't a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window so you don't know how far to move it  And what if the window
manager refuses to move your window

 I have a problem when I'm using PostScript When I am working local 
 on a SUN SPARCstation IPC the PostScript works good but when I connect
 to the SUN from a Xterminal I just get error messages that the
 PostScript cannot connect to the newsdisplay
  Why doesn't PostScript work on an Xterminal

	Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server  xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality once you add NeWS and
everything else you have a workstation  There are workarounds I've
heard one involving a perl script  What we are trying to do is
replace programs that need NeWS like pageview with programs that
don't like ghostview
	Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround I
have no personal experience with it

I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with

display  When I move the cursor over the window I get the Technicolor

My problemquestion is When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
XmDIALOGPRIMARYAPPLICATIONMODAL  The result is that if my cursor is
over the dialogShell I get my colormap but if the cursor is over the
applicationShell or any window other than the dialogShell I get the
default colormap  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over any
window of my application I get my colormap

Any suggestions  Thanks

 I posted this a while ago and didn't receive one reply and now we
 have another bug report on the same subject Can anybody help me out
 
 The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators
 and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply  Unfortunately
 the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined
 with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case
 Ctrl AnyKeyq
 
 In ORA Vol  in the section on accelerators it says For information
 on how to specify translation tables see Vol  this is so you
 know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource  If you go to
 Vol  it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is
 nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well For
 example the translation
 	ShiftKeyq	quit
 will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
 the Shift key and the q key
 
 This is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using
 event handlers instead of grabs it's not true for menu accelerators  If
 you're a Motif implementor I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
 changed to support the feature I described above  Otherwise change the
 documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's
 expectations because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
 translations
 
 Is it possible to supply   accelerator for a menu entry
 
 If you mean menu accelerator no it's not possible  That's according to
 the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page
 
 Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you
 can't use XtInstallAccelerators
 
 I can't think of a reason why not
 
 How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
 case  What I want is CtrlO and Ctrlo to both be accelerators on one
 menu entry

I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing  If I were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators I would have one
resource called accelerators that took a translation table period
I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed  As soon as the enduser specified
one it would be active and automatically installed

To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like

	menuItemaccelerators override n
		CtrlKeyM	fire n
		ShiftKeyL	fire n

The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a Ctrl M show up in your menuItem object

Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with  There
has to be some reason

Sorry for the political tone of this message

  attach the X server and then remove  the segment If you read the man
  pages on removing of shared memory segments you will see that the segment
  only dies after all attachments are gone
  Now if the client dies that's one attachment gone the OS cleans up for you
  and since the X server notices the client has dies frees up it's resources
  including detaching from the segment there goes the last attachment No more
  shared memory segment
  Terrible but it works

 Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvassee above 
 one intersecting the other
 Now I would like to delete one of the rectangles
 The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the
 GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the
newly
 created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes
 A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection
the pixel 
 locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which
is 
 something that should be avoided

You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it  Clear the
bitmap draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor  Draw the one
that is to stay with GXclear  Then GXxor the entire pixmap with
the screen  

Note that this is a pretty effective way of animation if you ever
need to do that replace the GXclear with a GXxor

   I need probably to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HPUX
   platform Do I need the Motif private header files and source
   or can I make do with the public headers that are provided
   Motif includes Xt in this context

Yes  You'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal

   One widget is a multicolumn list which lots of people have
   already written I am sure and would therefore be probably be
   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class
   Is this more difficult in principle not lines of code

I'm not sure what you're asking  You could create something
which is very much like a true multicolumn list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window  This wouldn't
be good for very large lists  but you might consider this
as an alternative

   Alternatively if anyone has a multicolumn list widget they
   could sell me this might save me from having to write one
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif  already I do not
   yet have the spec

Motif  does not have a multicolumn list in it  Have you
looked at commercial sets  There are also some PD 
widget sets  one of these might have a multicolumn list
you could port

 My question is this  Is there a means of determining what the state
 of CapsLock andor NumLock is

Alright  Ignore this  I have delved a bit deeper XKeyEvent and
found what I was looking for

evstate   has a bunch of masks to check against LockMask is the one
for CapsLock  Unfortunately it appears that the NumLock mask varies
from server to server  How does one tell what mask is numlock and
which are for Meta ModMask ModMask ModMask ModMask ModMask
eg SGI's vendor server has ModMask being NumLock whereas Solaris
 OpenWindows  has ModMask for NumLock  Is there an
unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any
given server  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance

I have the MarchApril version of the X Journal open in front of me

I'll be working on programming xclients this summer and since I don't have
much experience with programming X I thought this issue might be helpful
as it has a section on debugging and a section on the  most common errors
in programming X

At the end of the errors section there are the following references for
tutorials on X programming style  They are

Rosenthal David    A simple X client program
  Proceedings of the Winter  Usenix Conference 

Lemke D and Rosenthal D   Visualizing X clients

Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or preferably

Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to
programming X I'll be looking at the bookstore for books so I am really
only asking about what I can find on the net

Thanks to those who responded

We were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods

 running twm rather than olwm
 keeping olwm but putting wmTimeout  in the resources

It has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the
window manager positioning the popup window Any guru who can analyse
what is going on from this information please post and let us know

Hi folks

Say I'm new to R and have one quick question

In using xon  xon  machinename    I notice that it
always comes up with a very small window   I'm pretty
sure its the default font  My xterms all work normally
Is xon supposed to read your Xresources for a font size 

xrdb q appears to show the right stuff

I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm fn x    etc
and everything is correct  Of course you could always do a 
simple script to do this  but I have a feeling I'm missing
something simple here

Comments  suggestions appreciated

Thanks in advance

Cutsie little Macintrashlike icons that are an instant recipe for
mousitis IMHO System  is undoubtedly the worst GUI I have used out of
that RISCOS MSWombles and X simply because it does not provide enough
keyboard shortcuts Windows I must confess I quite like cover your ears
  because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the
mouse
stuff delete
the user rather than making things easier  and there should always be
the option to do it your way if you want to which is why I like the
UNIXX combination so much  it's so customizable 

Hear Hear I agree completely One thing I can't stand about
the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use
the mousewhat if your mouse breaksyour whole system is
down  I like the mouseit is handy on some occassions such
as cut and past and moving icons around etc  But for most
work the keyboard and hot keys are  times faster than
using the mouse Sure it is a plus to be able to do something
simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it
before your are experienced A month Two Speaking of PCs at
the moment
	I don't think it is too much to ask that window
programmers provide not only a menumouse interface but also
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in
less time IF you are experienced
	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
UNIX especially since Unix is at least  more powerful than
DOS

I am in the process of installing XR on my Sun Sparcstation  and
have run into a problem  I imagine it has something to do with a missing
screen driver or something along those lines but figured someone out there
in Internet land might be able to help

I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed and would
like to have both installed concurrently  Thus I set it up to compile to my
usrXR directory  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled with
gcc so that it compiles without any warnings  I need it installed for PEXSI
so I set all those appropriate flags  When I run it however I get a message
along the lines of

Getting interface configuration  Operation not supported on socket

sunOpenFrameBuffer  Inappropriate ioctl for device

Fatal server error  no screens found 


Any ideas on how I can fix it  Please respond by email at the below

Thanks in advance

I am trying to build and use imake XR on an IBM RS running AIX V
I am having the following  problems

 Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
		This is a makefile
	at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
	preprocessor and into the Makefile  Most of the C preprocessors that
	I have used will not treat such a  as appearing at the start of the
	line  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
	start of a directive 

	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
	as the start of a directive  The cpp fails when it determines
	that This is not a known directive  I have temporarily hacked my
	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
	fix

 Several Imakefiles use  as a parameter to a macro when a particular
	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter  The AIX cpp
	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions I would appreciate
information about on your solutions  Perhaps this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed  Also do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly

   Sorry but olwm and tvtwm don't do it They place the title at that position
   and the window at a position below it

   This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
   configuration and restore is later

   Currently my solution is

	   XCreateWindow
	   XSetWMProperties
	   XMapWindow
	   XFlush
	   XMoveWindow


   It works with olwm but is less than elegant All this leaves me wondering
   if I'm overlooking something obvious

   Richard


I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the user window Maybe other window managers
have similar options
Another way to figure out the difference between the user window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window Unfortunately you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way

 unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any
 given server  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance

You'll have to check the keysyms on each of the keys for each
modifier The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier
you want A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only
way to do this and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock
modifier

I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either ie what if NumLock is mapped for more then
one modifier I suppose first found is as good as any

X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well 

Hope that helps

i am in need of a motifbased graphing package to integrate into a large
software package under development for distribution to universities  it
can be either public domain or commercial although a commercial package
can't have royalties required for binary only distribution  we need d
graphing capabilities at a minimum but d  would be nice  any info would
be appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest

thanks

Hi there

In article hisUUCP you write
From sphenhjedit Henrik Balthazar Hjort
Subject PostScript on Xterminal


 I have a problem when I'm using PostScript When I am working local
on a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good but when I connect
to the SUN from a Xterminal I just get error messages that the
PostScript cannot connect to the newsdisplay

 Why doesn't PostScript work on an Xterminal

 Is there any way to make it work


It might be that the X terminal doesn't support the Postscript
Extensions to X product  I use the 'dxpsview' program on a 
DECstation  to view postscript files but when I moved to an
NCD X terminal I couldn't use it any more  So I ftp'd and
compiled GhostScript GNU software  Now we can view postscript
files on our X terminals

Hope this helps

I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the user window Maybe other window managers
have similar options
Another way to figure out the difference between the user window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window Unfortunately you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way

	Another way would be to use GetGeometry to find out where
you are relative to the frame and TranslateCoordinates to find
out where your window's upperleft corner really is

   Hi
   
   I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better
   When I set up stuff in my emacs with a keymap and definekeys
   I can only access certain of the keys on my XTerminal's
   keyboard I can't get eg F Home End PgUp PgDn they all
   seem to have either the same or no keycode I have a feeling
   this can't be fixed in emacs itself but that I need to do some
   xmodmap stuff Can someone help me

Unfortunately the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs  I ran into this problem a while back my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences  for example the sequence ESC   B  
would indicate that the HOME key was pressed with the shift key
down  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers such
as shiftReturn

If anybody wants these changes they're welcome to them but you'll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file xtermc  Maybe if someone at OSF is 
interested I can send them the tweaks but I imagine they've got
bigger fish to fry hopefully including the much talked about 
emacs V  If there's sufficient interest I'll post the mods 
somewhere although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it

Notes 

  This special code will only apply if you let emacs create
   its own X window  If you run it in plain old tty mode which 
   includes Xterm windows then it's business as usual

  The patches I made were to version  under Sun OS 
   I also did this a while back under HPUX  The patches are
   in a chunk of code between 'if sun  endif' but could 
   easily be adapted for anything else

   Hey guys
   I work on many stations and would like this name and current logname
   to be in a title of Xterm when it's open and a machine name only
   when it's closed In other words I want HOST and LOGNAME to appear
   as a title of opened XTerm and HOST when XTerm is closed
   How can I do it

Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ
Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately  so I haven't
seen the FAQ lately to check


Two ways
 
  When you start the xterm you can use command line options
         n ICONNAME           To set the icon label
         T WINDOWTITLE        To set the window title
         title WINDOWTITLE    Equivalent to T WINDOWTITLE

  You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly

    The basic escape sequence is
	ESC  P  SOMEARBITARYTEXT BEL

    where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters
    P is an ASCII decimal digit  '' '' or '' depending
    on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title
    or both and SOMEARBITARYTEXT is your desired label string

    Hence this command will set the window  icon title
         echo YOURTITLEGOESHEREc 

    To set just the icon title
         echo YOURTITLEGOESHEREc 

    To set just the window title
         echo YOURTITLEGOESHEREc 

    Of course you may have to fiddle with exact syntax
    depending on how the echo command works on your system
    and what shell you are using I've shown SystemV semantics
    under Bourne or Korn shells

    Hint for Sun OS users  use usrbinecho instead of
    binecho or Csh's builtin echo  Otherwise you'll have
    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string
    instead of using convenient octal sequences

    If you want your titlebar updated continously say to show
    your current directory hostname or somesuch then you'll
    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands
    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
    in the prompt string itself sometimes not

 Do anyone know about any shading program based on Xlib in the public domain
 I need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program
 
 Appreciate the help
 
 
 I don't know if this might help but I've just started playing with a program
 called POVRay Persistance of Vision Raytracer that also displays its output
 via X Windows  It does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my
 PsuedoColor plane display  I got the source from from a site in Canda
 The person I retrieved them from was David Buck dbuckccscarletonca
 

I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
fi Gouroudshading of triangles This is fairly complex to do with plain
X Simpler shading models are implemented already fi in xd ask archie
where to get the latest version
For Gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only either MITSHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it or PEXOpenGL which should be able to shade themselves The portable
'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage
what would be good enough to do static things as fi fractal landscapes
or such stuff

To speak about POVRay the X previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good especially in speed protocolfriendlyness and
ICCCM compliance Have a look on xq my own preview code It is on

pubgfxraymiscxq

The README states the points where it is better than xwindowc from
POVRay

Thanks for this clue and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the

One solution due to Derek Ho when the popup is popped up we SetValue
its location  which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
previous popup The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue
first and only using SetValue if the required location is different
The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
location of the popup so that the SetValue really does change the
location of the popup We tried this just for a double check on the
source of the problem

The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows

 Use twm or mwm rather than olwm
 Use olwm with resource wmTimeout 
 Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed

This is obviously working around some bug somewhere

Keywords Window Manager Focus Motif

     I am working on an XWindow based application that needs to 
override some of the window manager focus processing  I am 
using XR and Motif  currently although I will also be 
working with Open Look in the future

     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
user from switching from one window of the application to 
another window  Let's say for example that Window A is on top 
of Window B in the window hierarchy  Normally if the user clicks 
the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the 
window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A  Under certain 
circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to 
beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window 
A

      From the research and testing I've done so far it appears that 
this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this 
case Motif  I haven't found any way to override this default 
processing through standard X Window functions  I can tell 
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
notify events but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the 
switch

      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very 
kludgy but it partially works  When I detect such a window switch 
in those cases when the switch is not allowed I manually force 
the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call 
and beep with the XBell function  This provides the necessary 
functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places 
twice

      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif or preferably any 
window manager when I don't want the window order switch to 
actually take place  Respond either by email or posting to this 
newsgroup

  it is much slower
  
  Has anyone any experience with these sample programs or why I get
  this behaviour  fast response time for the first time but slow response
  time from nd time onwards 
  Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time
  they popup in reasonable fast response time 
  
  Thankyou  Shirley
 
 Thanks to those who responded
 
 We were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods
 
  running twm rather than olwm
  keeping olwm but putting wmTimeout  in the resources
 
 It has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the
 window manager positioning the popup window Any guru who can analyse
 what is going on from this information please post and let us know
 
 Thanks  Shirley

I ran in to this problem I while ago and from what I remember you should use
XtTranslateCoordinates etc after realizing the main widget to calculate
the location of the popup then use something like XtVaSetValues on the
popup widgets before ever using them  Calling SetValues repeatedly eg
every time something pops up seems to be what slows you down  I never
delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though

Keywords Frequency data X Server architecture

Hello  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
X  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr Fred Brooks at
UNCChapel Hill  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design
currently we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
XWindows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget  

Unfortunately I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various X FAQs or X manuals that I've seen  Does anyone have some type of
frequency data like how many Copyrectangle operations vs drawlines and
things of that sort  Or barring that a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself

Any and all help would be very appreciated

Many thanks
    Mark

 I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with
 XCreateColormap and uses all of the colors available for my bit
 displayWhen I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
 some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
 XmDIALOGPRIMARYAPPLICATIONMODAL  The result is that if my cursor is
 over the dialogShell I get my colormap but if the cursor is over the
 applicationShell or any window other than the dialogShell I get the
 default colormap  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over any
 window of my application I get my colormap

I think this is correct behavior  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus  Since the dialog is modal mwm won't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell and so it won't allow cmap focus either

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicypointer I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicypointer also  That way the cmap
focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat its own path

if you have keyboardFocusPolicy explicit you can set cmap focus
explicit also but you then need a binding to ffocuscolor probably on

I am considering making a reasonably large application for free
distribution probably copylefted  I am going to use X  Now I'm
bewildered by the huge number of standards that open systems has
created  

I've lived in a fairly tookitsheltered environment  Most of the tools
here were produced with the Athena Widget set or X Intrinsics or Xw
  

In my humble opinion they look like crap  I don't know however if
this is a characteristic of the tookits or just poor aestetic taste
in the programmers

I would like my app to look a little more sculptured like mwm  I
understand however that mwm isn't free like the other tookits

I am getting Linux so I will have InterViews but I don't know how it
will look  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF but I don't
know what it looks like either

If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me I would be much
obliged  Which are free  Which are the best  Which are portable  Which
looks nice  Which is not a resource hog

Also if you happen to know which are available on Linux andor Sun
that would be a big help too

Thanks in advance

       Hint for Sun OS users  use usrbinecho instead of

Bad idea using usrbinecho is slower than the builtin echo
This is what I do It does execute hostname once per shell window
and does read in one extra file But manipluating the titles does not
require executing extra programs

Oh yes it does execute some programs once per each system 
But it stores them in a file for the next time


if   HOSTNAME  then
	setenv  HOSTNAME hostname

 figure how how to generate escape bell

 I may have done this before If so the variable E is set

Has anyone found a fix for the following problem

Client Software	SunOs  XR
Server Hardware	Sun IPC
Server Software	SunOs  Open Windows  w patch 

A Motif  application will periodically hang when run against the
OpenWindows  server xnews The pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect Sometimes pressing Return will
unstick the application but not usually It looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go Other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging If I log in from
another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
back to normal The same application when run against other X servers
including MIT XR Xsun DecWindows Tektronix X terminal has no
problems This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
workaround since most of our customers are OpenWindows users

I have tried the following things

     Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch
       

     Using mwm version  instead of olwm

     Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ question 
       This had the effect of disabling the pointandclick method of
       menu interaction as opposed to the clickanddrag method and
       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys It did seem to help but I
       was still able to get the application to hang

Repeat By

This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times

Click and release on a menu heading pulldown menu will pop up

Click and release on a menu item

Repeat until application hangs


Any help would be appreciated Thanks in advance

   because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the
 mouse
 stuff delete

 the option to do it your way if you want to which is why I like the
 UNIXX combination so much  it's so customizable

 the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use
 the mousewhat if your mouse breaksyour whole system is
 down  I like the mouseit is handy on some occassions such
 as cut and past and moving icons around etc  But for most
 work the keyboard and hot keys are  times faster than
 using the mouse Sure it is a plus to be able to do something
 simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it
 before your are experienced A month Two Speaking of PCs at
 the moment
 	I don't think it is too much to ask that window
 programmers provide not only a menumouse interface but also
 look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
 command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in
 less time IF you are experienced
 	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
 UNIX especially since Unix is at least  more powerful than
 DOS
 
And at least  more user unfriendly as well

Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination this is
driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do

I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy  allowing me an
additional resource name level

To illustrate I have an application with the following widget
heirarchy

	    Shell Widget
	         
	Application Widghet

I want the following

	    Shell Widget
	         
	Intermediate Widget
	         
	 Application Widget

where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
properties and propagates down new values from the shell widget

I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example
and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing
composite widgets

Please respond via email  Any help will be very much appreciated

text does not redraw itself

I am guessing that I have to force it to redraw with an
XExposeEvent sent to it via XSendEvent  Is this the best
way to get the text up again  I can't seeem to get
XSEndEvent to work right if this is a good approach
might anyone have an example lying around to show me how to
do this  I've RTFM all evening and did not find a decent

The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and
present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users

If you can use bsd
	there is xview OpenLook

	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif

	there is gopath a very nice C toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif
	         which is simpler
                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                 technical support from Bull via email
		 It has a nice draw program it uses motif which can be used
		 to create graphical frontend to programs
		 The data format is called streams which you can feed
		 to your programs I ported gopath on an internet machine
		 which is gone but if you use gcc with minimal effort
		 gopath can be ported to bsd
		 Last but not least gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
		 module They have an MSWindows driver module for instance

	Also many have written extensions to tktcl thus allowing powerful
	applications For instance tclnm  has snmp extensions for tktcl
	With ease I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs
	photowidget graphical interface file operations database 
	operationsetc The author of tclnm mail me a simple network 
	management application which was about  lines long  it displayed
	various environmental parameters from a router I wrote  a simple

While I cannot answer questions about running XDM over a DECnet I can
say that the following defines must be added to the sitedef before
building R before any X clients will work over a DECnet

From sitedef

define ConnectionFlags DTCPCONN DUNIXCONN DDNETCONN
define ExtraLibraries ldnet

Hoping this helps

xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window previous versions were limited to vertical text Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages but the notion of rotating a whole font

What's new

I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings  thus
speeding up redraws

Is there a PD version of cfb or other PD server stuff which has a colour frame
buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode ie where the screen
memory is grouped so that bit  of every pixel is here bit  is there etc

The only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the

but I suspect they did

I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system
that has a color hardcopy unit

	xwd  xwud display hostname

I had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager
and it worked fine but when I tried it with a more complex larger image
the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault  I tried it without the pipe
by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud
and got the same error from xwud  If I had to guess it seems like it's
running out of memory but this happened on a SPARC  with  megs  meg
swap space and only one user with minimal activity  The file was about  MB

This verion of xwdxwud was supplied with the Sun OpenWindows  distribution
which I believe corresponds to X R

Any ideas  Thanks in advance

MessageID AAexpolcsmitedu
Keywords protocol analyzer TCPIP
To xannounceexpolcsmitedu


Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW  We have several
Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on
several hundred subnets These are good tools but they are  heavy 
 hard to find when you need one  limited in their software expandibility
 difficult to use to upload data for analysis  cannot be remotely
operated and  cannot resolve names with DNS requiring much manual 
manipulation of the name table  We also sometimes use tcpdump but we found 
it  too difficult for most people  did not have enough information for
many protocols  could not be used interactively  could not handle
TCP streams and  could not read Sniffer files  However tcpdump did do
a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily
modified  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems
by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features

Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation  and Sun  under Ultrix  and
SunOS  respectively  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump
It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun  To build tcpview you will
need Motif  or better

The following files are available for anonymous ftp from 
ftpcacwashingtonedu in pubnetworking

tcpviewtarZ	tcpview and tcpdump source code
tcpviewsuntarZ	Sun binaries
tcpviewdectarZ	DEC Mips Ultrix  binaries

What tcpview adds to tcpdump
 easier interface
 enhanced protocol decoding
 hex display of frame
 capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt
 can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name
 ethernet address host table
 can easily follow a stream highlighting outoforder frames
 can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional
	processing


CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 

New features

Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files  When used with 'r' the 
file type will be automatically detected

Can now read in and use an SNMP MIB file

The hex format has been changed

New time options have been added

Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets

Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers S flag

New flags
R	read Sniffer file  Not usually needed except for reading from stdin
ttt	prints delta times
tttt	prints times relative to the first frame
W	write a Sniffer save file use with w
x	print frame minus linklevel header in hexdump format  
	Sample output

We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System
The toolkit copes with any languages based on XR's in
facility As you know there are  kinds of in implementation from MIT's 
XR release  Xsi and Ximp Our original implementation of the toolkit
uses Xsi

Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system
In order to do that the 'wchart' typed character strings must be decomposed
to character sets This means that if one wchart type compound string with 
ASCII and Kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchart
array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout
and application environment's locale In this case if the locale is 'japanese'
each wchart character will be classified either to iso jisx or so

We need a function to do this The function must check how many characters
from the top are the same character set and what the character set is

We could not find any public XR function to do that and inevitably used
Xsi's internal functions to construct that function The following is the
source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet'


INh
 This may look like C code but it is really  C 
 Id INhv    iima Exp iima 

ifndef INH
define INH

include XXlibh

extern int decomposeCharacterSetconst wchart wcstr	 IN 
				 int wclen		 IN 
				 char buf		 OUT 
				 int buflen		 INOUT 
				 int scannedlen	 OUT 
				 char charset	 OUT 
extern XmString wcharToXmStringconst wchart wcstr
extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWcharconst wchart wc

endif  INH 

INcc
 Id INccv    iima Exp  

include stdlibh

    extern int XwcDecomposeGlyphCharsetXLocale const wchart int
					 char int int int
    extern Charset XmbfscsXLocale CSID
    extern CSID XmbctidtocsidXLocale CSID


int decomposeCharacterSetconst wchart wcstr IN 
			  int wclen		 IN 
			  char buf		 OUT 
			  int buflen		 INOUT 
			  int scannedlen	 OUT 
			  char charset	 OUT 

    XLocale xlocale  XFallBackConvert
    int ctid
    int status
    Charset xcharset
    
    status  XwcDecomposeGlyphCharsetxlocale wcstr wclen buf
				       buflen scannedlen ctid
    if status  Success 
	xcharset  Xmbfscsxlocale Xmbctidtocsidxlocale ctid
	charset  xcharset  xcharsetcsname  NULL
    
    else
	charset  NULL
    return status



An included file above Xlocaleinth is also Xsi internal and we copied
the file to the toolkit directory and compiled

A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on
our HP machine with its OS version of HPUX

When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit
link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing
    Xmbctidtocsid code
    Xmbfscs code
    XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset code
    XFallBackConvert code

We had used MIT release version of XR and its Xsi implementation until
HPUP and ran applications successfully One of the reasons to use Xsi was that
because HP did not release HP's XR until the OS  and we had no way to 
know how HP's R would be implemented We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used 
its internal functions 

The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented
We observe from HP's libXa they used some Ximp implementation but we are
not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and
therefore finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not
seem to lead us a solution

My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like
'decomposeCharacterset' listed above Is there any function to check
character set of each element of wchart type strings depending on locales
If it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we
want to use any internal functions in HP's XR as we did for MIT's R

In order to render a 'wchart' type string there must be some machinery
to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for
the string We have no way to find out that without any HP's XR source 
files We want to know how we can use that for our goal 
Any help or comments would be highly appreciated

I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area
even if it is not HP's implementation

Thank you

I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the user window Maybe other window managers
have similar options
Another way to figure out the difference between the user window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window Unfortunately you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way

	Another way would be to use GetGeometry to find out where
you are relative to the frame and TranslateCoordinates to find
out where your window's upperleft corner really is


As I've said before there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration  If your window has been reparented you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration  There may be several
layers of windows  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display tvtwm

There is no such thing as X Windows or X Window despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags  This probably tells you something
about how much to trust the trade rags  if they can't even get the NAME

to say

With regard to dialup X implementations there are several  You can
buy serial X terminals from a couple of companies including both 
GraphOn and NCD  In fact I'm composing this from an NCD running X
over serial lines across  kbaud connection  

NCD also sells a softwareonly package that provides XRemote which is
NCD's implementation of serial X for PC's  There may be other such 
software packages available

XR is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running
X over lowspeed connections  It's called Low Bandwidth X LBX and 
is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote 

It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard there
will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various 
sorts of hardware

Did you install the sunkbd patch  It's in the contrib directory on export
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly except the following

Even the compose key works  Though I can't seem to get the composed

Anyone have a fix for the last two

fix the table in XRmitserverddxsun or
use xmodmap

put

in your login the first prevents the stripping of bit 
the second sets the locale the third makes less show the character

Hi 

I am using Xview  on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use  bit color I am having some problems
utilizing the  bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video My video input is  bit color

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame  Frame xvcreateNULLFRAMENULL
seems to have a depth of  which is propagated to my canvas

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be  bits
I tried using the following Xlib code 

XVisualInfo visualinfo
int depth  
Colormap colormap
XSetWindowAttributes attribs
unsigned long valuemask  
Window win
Xvopaque frame

win  xvgetframeXVXID
XMatchVisualInfodisplayscreendepthTrueColorvisualinfo

 So far so good 

colormap  XCreateColormapdisplaywinvisualinfoAllocNone

 It dies here with a BadMatch error  

attribscolormap  colormap
valuemask  CWColormap
XChangeWindowAttributesdisplaywvaluemaskattribs
XSetWindowColormapdisplaywincolormap


Am I using a completely wrong approach here  Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview  What am I doing wrong 

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay

Thanks again

Hi netlanders

Does anybody know if there is something like Macintosh Hypercard for any UNIX 
platform

There are several products you might investigate  If you've got
 per seat and highend hardware Gain Momentum might be a good
choice  It isn't compatible with HyperCard but has a similar
architecture and way more functionality  I don't have contact
information but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't
be too hard to find

If you're running News on SPARC check out HyperLook
hyperlookturingcom  It uses Postscript as a scripting language
which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting
but not so good for nonprogrammers  It was  last I heard

You might also look at our product MetaCard  We're alphatesting
direct importing of HyperCard stacks we've even made the test release
available for anonymous FTP so we're obviously the closest in
functionality  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs
  Email to infometacardcom for more details
  Scott

Thanks in advance

 I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
 fi Gouroudshading of triangles This is fairly complex to do with plain
 X Simpler shading models are implemented already fi in xd ask archie
 where to get the latest version
 For Gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
 only either MITSHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
 with it or PEXOpenGL which should be able to shade themselves The portable
 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage
 what would be good enough to do static things as fi fractal landscapes
 or such stuff
 
 To speak about POVRay the X previewer that comes with the original source
 package is not that good especially in speed protocolfriendlyness and
 ICCCM compliance Have a look on xq my own preview code It is on
 
 pubgfxraymiscxq
 
 The README states the points where it is better than xwindowc from
 POVRay 
 

The version I have is using the xq code instead of the default X Windows
code  I have it currently running on a DEC Alpha running OpenVMS AXP and
so far have been pretty impressed  The only sideeffect of xq is that
it requires xstdcmap best be run before it will work annoyning but not a
show stopper

eg   colormap  DefaultColormapmydisplay myscreen

The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCellsmydisplay

much less than this depending on the color requirements of the windows
currently in place I'd like a way to determine this number Thanks in

but I would like to be able to have two types of actions one to occur

However I don't know how to make my leftButtonPressMask  There didn't seem
to be one in the event mask lists I had on hand although ButtonMotionMask
looked promising  My references also mentioned using  to or two
mask events  Can you  use  to and two masks  Would I want to in this

Hello folks

I'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map

mwm invalid accelerator specfication line x

I've added a line in the start up file before the line
that starts mwm It looks like the following

xmodmap keymapfile
mwm

I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between
function keys F through F which already have assigned
functions eg Move Minimize etc

The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run

xmodmap keymapfile

from an xterm

Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map specifically
F through F AND not have mwm Motif Window Manager complain

I realize this is a bit stupid but we only have time to
implement not time to learn how to implement

Hi Xperts

this is a repost no one responded to my desperate yell 
I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 

I'm using sliders in my XView apps usually with editable numeric
field But I seem to have no control over the length of this field
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters
in some  it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANELMAXVALUE 

As I understand PANELVALUEDISPLAYLENGTH which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items doesn't
work in the case of slider despite the fact that panelh
contains the following bit

	 Panelmultilinetextitem Panelnumerictextitem
	  Panelslideritem and Paneltextitem attributes
	 
	PANELNOTIFYLEVEL	 PANELATTRATTRENUM			 
	PANELVALUEDISPLAYLENGTH	 PANELATTRATTRINT		 

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders
But  setting this attribute gives nothing and  xvget'ting
this attribute gives warning Bad attribute and returns value 

Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space
in a text fields but not Sun's Xview

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me
and clear this problem 

Any help is very much appreciated

I'm writing an X server for some videogeneration equipment  The
hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a bit
static color visual  I would really like to have the server just
present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be 
acceptable to most X clients  The three problems I see are

   The colormap though huge is static
   All pixels would be  bytes wide
   Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the
     translation RGBYUV will introduce some rounding error

Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask will these
limitations thwart many X clients  Or will most of the X stuff
floating around blithely accept what they're given  I could write
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of eg  bits 
but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary

I know there are no absolutes but I'd appreciate hearing people's
opinions and suggestions  Thanks

I am looking for a commercialPD graphics editor with fairly limited
abilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets It must
run on HPUX version  either with or without the PEX extension The
sort of things I want are simple drawing resizing and moving of objects
such as lines rectangles and text Bounding rectangle operations are
sufficient for object selection Ideally it should also allow the
creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets eg
text entry fields or labels but this is not mandatory

Does anyone have such an animal If you do please mail me with details
including price especially runtime licensing since it must be
included in a product Alternatively send glossies to me at Logica

Yet again

the escape sequences you are speaking about here are non standard and
dangerous In fact an ANSI compliant sequence parser HANGS on them

Why are there such strange ESC sequences instead of compatible DSC

We recently got an NCD Xterminal to evaluate This is running XRemote over
a serial line
I wanted to get some measurement of response time so I wrote a small Xlib
program which simply creates a window maps it and sends the first Expose 
event to itself The program times the delay from sending the event to 
receiving it  I thought this was the simplest way to test clientXserver 
roundtrip delays It's a similar concept to the pingC program

Is this a valid test to perform  I've also tried the xbench program available
from ftpuunet which bombards the server with graphics operations but I 
just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is acceptable interactive 
response time Has anyone got any ideas on this subject 

Thanks

Excerpts from netnewscompwindowsx Apr X Toolkits Paul
Prescodundergradm 

 I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF but I don't know what it
 looks like either

The Andrew User Interface System is supported maintained enhanced and
distributed by the Andrew Consortium Carnegie Mellon  The distribution
terms are those of the X consortium not the GNU Public License  Thus
anyone can commercially exploit the Andrew code without restriction 
To encourage membership however we defer universal release of the
latest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity to
explore the new capabilities

To se what AUIS looks like you can try a remote demo  You need an X
server R is best on a machine linked to the internet  Give the
command 

	finger helpatkitccmuedu 

for instructions

NOTE  The demo version does not use the Motiflookandfeel scrollbar
but one is available  You can use it on the demo by changing an option
in the preferences file and starting a new editor

The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to build
applications using compound documents  Andrew's major feature is its
architecture for recursive embedding of objects equation in table in
figure in text for example  This architecture extends to areas not
usually found in toolkits including file stream formats cutpaste and
printing

Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications 
word processor spreadsheet drawing editor and font editor the latter
two are in version  which will be generally released on the XR tape
in December

  The shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its

  it thinks the window is already in the right place
  
  Exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
  me all information greatly received

The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child
without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor
The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got
picked up by the child  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if
the timing was 'right'

We have an old Sun here which gets occasional use  When XR is started
on it any console messages during startup are undeletable  After X is fully
started we run an xterm as the console  the problem is that any messages
that arrive before this starts go to the plain console  Refresh window fails
to remove them  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
the screen obscuring anything else below them

At boot time the  lists two framebuffers    devcgfour and devbwtwo
We're running X in color and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are
on the BW framebuffer and thereby not getting deleted

My question is has anyone else seen this and is there an easy way to get rid
of these messages

Please reply by email to hughminmoscouk

 I'm writing an X server for some videogeneration equipment  The
 hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a bit
 static color visual  I would really like to have the server just
 present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be 
 acceptable to most X clients  The three problems I see are
 
    The colormap though huge is static
    All pixels would be  bytes wide
    Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the
      translation RGBYUV will introduce some rounding error
 
 Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask will these
 limitations thwart many X clients  Or will most of the X stuff
 floating around blithely accept what they're given  I could write
 the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of eg  bits 
 but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary
 

Even Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated
 bit PseudoColor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and
thelike to run I strongly suppose you to emulate at least

  Bit TrueColor Should be no problem only some translation Rounding
  should not make big misfits
  bit PseudoColor More of a problem you have to emulate a colormap
  pixel indices conversion stuff Furthermore you should run your default
  screen on this visual

Even Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated
 bit PseudoColor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and
thelike to run I strongly suppose you to emulate at least

  Bit TrueColor Should be no problem only some translation Rounding
  should not make big misfits

Depends on the nature of the rounding  X allows the user to do bit
arithmetic on pixel values ie  XOR foreground and backgroun pixel
values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a
function of GXxor fill change foreground to background and viceversa
If your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then 
clients that use them will break

 I'm writing an X server for some videogeneration equipment  The
 hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a bit
 static color visual  I would really like to have the server just
 present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be 
 acceptable to most X clients  The three problems I see are
 
    The colormap though huge is static
    All pixels would be  bytes wide
    Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the
      translation RGBYUV will introduce some rounding error

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a bit
TrueColor visual The main problems we encountered were

	 Clients written with logic like the following

	    if DefaultDepth  
		 Assume default depth is bit 

	   These clients need an bit deep visual in the root window
	   to run correctly

	 Other clients didn't even bother to do that much and just
	   outright assumed they had a dynamic visual class with a
	   dynamic colormap XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps
	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes but
	   many clients don't bother to check they just start
	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you

Though both are clearly client error this is the case with so many
clients that it's easier for you to expose bit PseudoColor as a
default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client
writers to change their clients to do the right thing

 No it isn't  It is the X Window System or X or X or any of
 a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium  In fact
 doing man X on pretty much any X machine will tell you
 
      The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used
      when referring to this software
 
                                   X
                            X Window System
                              X Version 
                      X Window System Version 
                                  X
 
 There is no such thing as X Windows or X Window despite the repeated
 misuse of the forms by the trade rags  This probably tells you something  about how much to trust the trade rags  if they can't even get the NAME
 of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have 
 to say

I used to think this way and not just about X For example incorrect
English constructs such as its raining or it's window id annoy me
However there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way
things really are in the world Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS
was really down to popular opinion I know we all think it's technically
superior as well

On a related topic who is to say that color is more or less correct
than colour  being Irish and hence using English English as opposed
to American English I always use the latter except of course for API
terms such as XAllocColor and colormap

In a world that uses the term Windows to refer to Microsoft Windows
perhaps the time has come to accept X Windows as a valid term for X
I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than say
the X Window System and let's face it almost everyone uses it
Ultimately we all need product sales to more than just Xliterate
people In this respect product recognition is important and a short
snappy descriptive title X is positively obscure will help
when dealing with the average punter it's sad  I thought I was a
software engineer Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become
popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should
be called Microsoft Windows or the Microsoft Window System or
how about just plain Microsoft

To summarise or should that be summarize the point of this message
I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than
worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system
or should that be windowing system Whatever gets recognised is
fine by me I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what
trade papers say However I would be reluctant to come to this
conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System

Well yes and no  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark
a lengthy debate but I do think it's worth pointing out that popular
usage is not always sufficient excuse  

In this case for example I think an appropriate parallel may be found
in the pronunciation of proper names if people commonly misspelled or 
mispronounced your name would you feel compelled to change it  Probably
not  

The same is true of X  The X Window System X X and related
monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
proper name  In fact some of them are trademarked names  The fact 
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point  

As for the trade publications that promulgate things like X Window or
Xwindows or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees 
consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by 
journalists  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't
be bothered to get the name of hisher source right  Would you trust
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong

Popular usage is as it may be but I for one am all for holding people
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness

Indeed the fact that X won out over NeWS
was really down to popular opinion I know we all think it's technically
superior as well

X technically superior to NeWS  Well in some alternate universe
perhaps

The conference will be held on the last Thursday and Friday in June  A
tutorial will be on Thursday the th and the conference proper on the
th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the
two days  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting
though only Consortium members will be able to vote

This year's theme is 

	Application Construction by NonProgrammers

Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer
construction of applications  There have however been some excellent
UIMS systems built on top of X  Papers addressing the theme will
consider questions such as
	What is needed for application construction by nonprogrammers
	Can we avoid programming altogether or is a simple language needed
	Is it sufficient to create applications or must users be able to
create new widgets
	Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves

Your participation in the conference is welcome  Papers are appropriate
on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System including

	applications
	experience with users
	new objects
	reviews of and proposals for revision of 
		internal Andrew protocols

We expect to have an RS with video projector available if you would
like to do a demonstration  

Paper proposals should be submitted by  May 
Acceptance will be  June with final papers due by  June

Yes

and colormap for a window created by Xview  What am I doing wrong 

Look up XVDEPTH  Also you might want to try using XView colormap segments
instead of Xlib for your colormap stuff  They will probably be easier
for you to use and since you are using a TrueColor visual you won't
be losing anything compared to straight Xlib

announcement for where Motif can be obtained

Enjoy

   


Welcome to the Motif Mailing List

The Motif mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif the PD C
wrapper library for Motif where people can ask questions about Motif 
swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the 
bindings 

All requests of an administrative nature like subscription removal etc
should be directed to motifrequestcvruunl

All email sent to motifcvruunl will be sent to the entire list so
please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to
messages automatically that the address for the mailinglist is excluded 
from autoreplies

Hello Motif World

over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to
the Motif bindings Imake support has been improved a few defaults have
been changed and a lot of other small things have been added

This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status Next release will
incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz and possibly will support
XR and Motif x

Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive please retrieve this
distribution during offpeak hours and delete all previous copies

Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT

HISTORY

The University of Lowell supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation
has developed a wrapperlibrary that encapsulates Motif widgets in C
classes All resources of these Widgets can now be set through
memberfunctions while objects can be used in callbackfunctions The library
was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 
However the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights and only
worked under XR Due to lack of subsequent fundings the bindings are no
longer actively supported by the University of Lowell

I Ronald van Loon at a certain point last year have taken the Lowell 
bindings fixing the bugs I came across adding missing memberfunctions and
enhancing functionality and made the bugfixed library available for the
general public for anonymous ftp made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC

NEW RELEASE

I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif
bindings 

This release offers

 Full Motif and XR support
 Support for Xbae widgetset 
 Two additional widgets written by myself that can be used to indicate
  progress in an application
 Imake support NB this release relies heavily on the existence of imake
		     and its config files on your site I have tried to
		     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile tweakable
		     for those unfortunates without imake I have not severely
		     tested the standard Makefile though Contact me if you
		     have problems The reason for calling this a gamma
		     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude
		     of platforms to test the Imakefiles on
 Lots of testfiles even somewhat useful programs
 An article I wrote on the usage of Motif X and C previously posted
  on Usenet

WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS

Ftp

Anonymous ftp at decuacdeccom  directory pubX

Note

Please be patient as the network link is quite slow Please do not FTP large
files during working hours

Also note that there is also a motifjantarZ file at this site this
is an old version of the bindings

Email

Those who don't have ftp can send me email and I will send the bindings by
email

REQUEST

Those who use the bindings and find bugs or see room for improvement please
contact me and I will try to incorporate them in a future release in case of
bugs a bugfix of course

The XView version  source distribution included in the contrib section 
of XR included the source to the textedit program  I'd like to take 
the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalklike message 
server and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it since the Sunsupplied
textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk

However the sources in the R contrib area seem to be for an older
version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows   For
example the OWN  textedit includes drag and drop support and a 
dropsite in the main control area while the source in contribxview
knows nothing about drag and drop

The texteditc included in the xview sources says it's version 
dated  while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN  binary says

        texteditc   Copyr  Sun Micro
        dragdropc   Copyr  Sun Micro
        tooltalkc   Copyr  Sun Micro
        dsrelnamec      Copyr  Sun Micro

So does anyone know if the  sources to textedit are available
I'd really like to work from the latest source if possible

Please reply by email and I'll post a summary if there's enough 
interest

I have noticed in FrameMaker X on both the SGI and SUN platforms
that certain dialogs such as Column Layout for example respond
to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog
window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is
POINTER

How is this done

I would like to emulate this behavior in my application It seems a
reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard
action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the
user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus

Alternatively I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the right
way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear particularly
when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus
policy is pointer

I'm writing an application running under X using Motif and I need to do
some stuff when the application quits  Now when I shut down my X Windows
session it doesn't seem to send a SIGTERM or whatever signal to my
application I'm trapping various signals like that  Therefore I thought
I could use an X signal to check for my top level window being destroyed

However I seem to get DestroyNotify events whenever I move windows  Is
there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed
some field to check or some combination of events

Replies by email please and I will summarise

Dear Folks

It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program 
Xavier an audio and video  extension to InterViews

XaviereXtension AV class for IntERviews is a C class library
that adds multimedia capability to InterViews It allows composite
multimedia objects to be built from media objects

Specifically it adds audio and video objects to the classes available
in InterViews  and it does so without changing the
source code for the original classes though several configuration
files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file 
 
Currently the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN
workstations with an audio interface such as the SPARCstation

Xavier has been tested in the following environments

SUN
  Machine  SPARCserver SPARCstationIPC
  OS       SUNOS or later
  C      SUN C ver

NECEWS
  Machine  EWS
  OS       EWSUXVRel WSOS ReleaseRelease
  C      C Release

It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from 

         interviewsstanfordedu in pubcontrib
          Xavierlargedemotar and Xaviertar

We are preparing a mailinglist for information regarding Xavier
If you are interested please contact
               
                   xaviertslclneccojp 

I will add your email address to our list

I don't know if there's a corresponding patch for Solaris  but this

Actually I suspect that the OW  problem may be different since the

I'm just guessing here but I'd guess that XR expects the CG to have

I've used XR with classics set for both x and x you
can choose which resolution you want in the PROM monitor before

using the multiscreen version  Here's how our version was built

I'm working on an XR application and have concerns regarding 
standard colormaps

The XR documentation says Usually a window manager creates 
these colormaps  I wonder what window manager the writer had 
in mind  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps

Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps  
However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid 
conflicts with the default colormap  When I use standard 
colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black  
So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very 
problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid  Perhaps 
if every application used standard colormaps things would 
be wonderful  But not many applications seem to use 
standard colormaps

Finally the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation 
XmuStandardColormap and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent 
with the section  of the XR XLIB documentation

    According to the section  of the XR XLIB documentation p 

    For GrayScale colormaps only the colormap redmax redmult and 
    basepixel members are defined  The other members are ignored  
    To compute a GrayScale pixel value use the following expression

            gray  redmult  basepixel xFFFFFFFF

    XmuGetColormapAllocation defined in mitlibXmuCmapAllocc is 
    used by XmuLookupStandardColormap defined in mitlibXmuLookupCmapc
    to select redmax greenmax and bluemax values for the 
    call to XmuStandardColormap  When the RGBGRAYMAP property is 
    specified XmuGetColormapAllocation sets redmax to  of the 
    total number of cells in the gray scale sets greenmax to  
    of the total number and sets bluemax ot  of the total number
    Referring to section  one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation 
    to set redmax to the total number of cells in the gray scale

    When the RGBGRAYMAP property is specified XmuStandardColormap 
    defined in mitlibXmuStdCmapc sets redmult greenmult 
    and bluemult all equal to   Referring to section  
    one would expect greenmult and bluemult to be ignored

    When redmult greenmult and bluemult all equal  
    XmuCreateColormap defined in mitlibXmuCrCmapc constructs 
    a gray map The sum of redmax greenmax and bluemax gives 
    the maximum gray value  Referring to section  on would 
    expect redmax to give the maximum gray value

Hi All

I tried to run SoftPC a PC emulation software program installed on a Silicon 
Graphics workstation from a Human Design System HDS X terminal and 
everything went fine except the fonts could NOT be converted from one type 
of format to the other  HDS uses different font format from SGI worksation
So I have the following questions

 How do you resolve different font formats from different machines

 Is there a program to convert one type of font format to another

If you have similar problemsexperiences and have found a solution please 
let me know  Your help will be greatly appreciated

Thank you in advance for your help and information

 The XR documentation says Usually a window manager creates

Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers
would make them available This doesn't mean that every window manager
author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and
implemented this at top priority

The ESGE server we ship makes the XARGBBESTMAP available at
startup It doesn't wait for window managers to do it

 Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps  
 However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid

 standard colormaps

Does your hardware have only one CLUT Since standard colormaps
typically devour all  entries there is no way it can avoid
displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one
CLUT

I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible
colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap Rather
colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the
same standard colormap An example would be two clients that need a
full color range would both use XARGBBESTMAP or whatever it's
called under XR

If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default
colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into
that colormap If you can't do that then you'll get flashing on a one
hw CLUT framebuffer

Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your
client this flashing could also be avoided Perhaps some window
managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps

I am almost done porting XFree  to a new piece of display
hardware but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat
commonplace so I'm sending a netfeeler

I have a display that is a noninterlaced memory mapped bit
x display  The server's view of the world obtained via xwd 
xwud seems to be exactly what it should be  However the displayed
version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is
using scanlines that are too long  After a bit of experimentation it
seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to
a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer is  bytes which
isn't exactly divisible by four  Changing the following defines in
mitserverincludeservermdh



define BITMAPSCANLINEPAD  
define LOGBITMAPPAD		
define LOGBYTESPERSCANLINEPAD	



to



define BITMAPSCANLINEPAD  
define LOGBITMAPPAD		
define LOGBYTESPERSCANLINEPAD	



Was not exactly the right solution  How do I tell the server either
a don't pad the scan lines at all 'cause this server is only being
built to run on this particular display or to pad only to byte
boundries

I'm using a customized version of XFreev under Mach 

Thanks

These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these
specific questions

  If my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method
My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping for each key press with a 
modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers
in a lookup table  I would like to do it the second way but I can't seem to
get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers  I know that
when an app calls XSetModifierMapping a MappingNotify event is generated
nonmaskable which I can pick up and modify my internal table  But I don't
seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap  If I use Xt all 
O'Reilly has to say is 'is automatically handled by Xt'  If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent I get nothing  This all stems from problems with users of 
the Sun  keyboard and the NumLock plus various AltMetaetc modifier 
requirements

  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right
of my main window  I want it at the same y coord and their rightleft
sides touching  What I need to ask for is the xy coord of the window 
manager's border for the main window  This should ring a bell with anyone
who has called XtMoveWidget immediately checking the xy after the move
and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy
and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border

Any help would be most appreciated

I have the following problem on XR servers

When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has
the Save Under attribute set the subwindows of my window are not restored

Normally the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose
event but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window
that obscured my window no expose event is sent

When ExposureMask is set for the child windows those windows are correctly
updated when the popup window disappears however then the application
gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws

Everything works fine with XR

Is this something that is changed between XR and XR obvious
Is it something I do wrong
Is there something that the popup window should do which is also mine
Is this a bug in X release

I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it Then again
I've had some problems with the mail system Apologies if this appears
for the second time

Usually when I start up an application I first get the window outline
on my display I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen Yet when I specify the geometry 
option the window appears right away the properties specified by
the geometry argument The question now is

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position but that did alter the normal program behaviour

Thanks for any hints
 Robert

Dear sun and windows people

I am running sun workstations with SunOs  and 
vanilla X R I have a bunch of xterminals as well

Today I had my xdm fail At about 
it was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal
The message was the xdm too many retransmissions
In my xdmerrors file I had the following entries


  error pid  Server for display  terminated unexpectedly
  
  error pid  WARNING keyboard on display  could not be
  secured
  error pid  Server for display  terminated unexpectedly
  
  I also had
  
  error pid  WARNING keyboard on display  could not be
  secured
  error pid  Server for display  terminated unexpectedly
  
  error pid  WARNING keyboard on display  could not be
  secured
  error pid  Server for display  terminated unexpectedly
  

Also at the console the login box would come up for
about  seconds and then
it would go away It would do this continuously

I could login from another workstation to the hosts in question
however I could not login on the console

I tried killing xdm and restarting it but that didn't help
I finally rebooted all the hosts Which hurts when done in the
middle of the day

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks

  The CG is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'
What is the significance of this to the X server and how do we install

We have a Sun  and we have just acquired a cg frame buffer card

The cg is supposed to support both a bit color visual and a monochrome visual
The default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome and we are unable to change it to
the bit visual We have tried using XGetVisualInfo to get a visual of depth  but had no
success  xdpyinfo gives no information about a bit deep visual only monochrome 

There are two possible solutions
	If someone has patches for XR Xsun server could they forward them to us

	Otherwise could someone instruct us how to access the bit color in openwindows

We've just recently upgraded our X to R and are now running into problems

w client call  is nil  The client and call pointers are okay in some
instances but bogus in other instances

We are running SunOS  on a Sun   After compiling XR and all 
patches with the MotifBC flag set we recompiled Motif and then we 
recompiled the application

Did we skip a step or leave something out  Is there a flag that we should
have used  Should we have left Motif alone

Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated

What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas   

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself To give you a realworld example here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly  people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other It's not too much of a load on our
Ethernet with maybe  concentrators so you have  people on each
segment If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself Say you have a 
 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card If you have
 people running programs off it you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on effectively a  MHz  Of course DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have  working programs running you'll know it


Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year  The link I want to use 
though ISDN K is costly and the bandwidth limited  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it


Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run  people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth

Hmmm  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  Are you
running any standard MSWindows programs like Word   What sort of 
packets go blazing through What size link do you have Mb or Mb 
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points


It all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you're going
to see a slowdown from Xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also
 

What do you mean by network things  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DVX protocol in transferring these 
images with Xcalls and displaying them on a client's machine

Hi there

I posted this to compwindowsxintrinsics but got no response so I'm posting
here

I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation an HP 
It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices
including digitiser tablets  However this digitiser makes use of the serial
port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver

The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from
devices listed in the usrlibXXdevices file   display number
I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert devrsc as an input
device in this file and expect a digitiser to work  But maybe I'm wrong  Am I

What I would like to know is does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
to their workstation for use as a pointer for X rather than just as input to a
specific X application  If so what were the steps required for installation
Did you need a special device driver  Did the manufacturer supply it  Are
there generic public domain device drivers around  I understand that
digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats

Any help would be greatly appreciated

Cheers
 Vaughan

i read about the code you can put in to most applications so that
the virtual desktop stuff in tvtwm doesn't confuse them or is the
application confusing the virtualness chicken  the egg

but wanted to see if it has been applied to a version of xroach

i never could quite get ssetroot to work either any suggestions
luckily xv root quit does the trick for the most part

also i'ld be quite interested in hearing more about the icon region

I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding reentrancy I
decided to implement an animated cursor using  created cursors by calling
XDefineCursor from a SIGALRM signal handler This is used to indicate we are
waiting for a operator request to complete on a production control system
I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring
the standard cursor when complete I found dumped core  and upon analysis
it was when the SIGALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call XDrawString
was doing a bcopy presumably an internal structure when the XDefineCursor
was called Presumably the internal structure that XDrawString was manipulating
was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been

Has anyone else experienced this Is there any official documentation that
says you should ensure this doesn't happen Or should bcopy be atomic
We are running on SGI Irix  with XR

 As I announced at the X Technical Conference in January I would like

 make ImakeTeX the Imake support for using the TeX typesetting system
 publically available Currently ImakeTeX is in beta test here at the
 computer science department of Dortmund University and I am looking
 for
 some more beta testers preferably with different TeX and Imake
 installations

Judging from the responses so far I have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that ImakeTeX is not for installing TeX but for
using it With ImakeTeX you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs makeindex bibtex Simply
type make and your document's DVI file will be uptodate All you have
to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable
Makefile for you Here is such an Imakefile

	include TeXtmpl
	PaperFormatA
	SimpleLatexTargetdocument

The generated Makefile provides the following commands

    make depend    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like
                    inputsomefile

    make dvi       Generate an uptodate DVI file

    make viewdvi   Display it on your screen

    make ps        Generate a PostScript version of your document

    make viewps    Display it

    make clean     Remove unnecessary things

    make veryclean Remove even the DVI file

    make Makefiles Generate Makefiles in subdirectories


If 

a this seems attractive to you
b you are willing to test ImakeTeX and send me a short test report
c you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation
   however the German version is completed and included

then you are invited as a beta tester I am looking forward to your email

Hi ppl

I am running XFree under Linux SLS and am trying to get the german
keyboard working I have already recompiled my kernel and the german
keyboard in the textmode works just fine
I have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X
called Xmodmapgr in usrlibX so I ran xmodmap usrlibXXmodmapgr
My first impression was very good I was able to get Z and Y straight 
There's still a little problem I can't solve however
I cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly brackets
The ALTGR key doesn't seem to work
I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does
Looking up its keycode  in the Xmodmap I found the entry Modeswitch
which doesn't ring any bell The entries for the keys I cannot use seem
to be correct Example keycode XX  ssharp questn backslash
The first  entries I can even get at The first one is the unmodified
key and the second is the key with shift but what is the rd
My guess is that it should be the key with ALTGR but it isn't
If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them
help would be appreciated

It doesn't respond to users input I button press events are queued and
exected after server finished its task Now I am going to try AppAddInput
call So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe

I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client
which is my X application will read Now I have some doubts which you may
be able to clarify

 When I fork a process It will create to copy of my process Right 
   Now what does this two copies mean Two Shells Where should I fork
   my application What are the responsibilities of this processes How
   should I call this processes

 Can I fork more than one processes So that I can read from more
   than one servers input

Hi netters

I've just built XR pl  under Solaris  I've used the multiscreen 
patch as well as the RSunOS patch and everything builds great except 
for that error message Xsun gives me upon startup It says 
Cannot set default font path 'stuff deleted' and Cannot set default font
'fixed' If I supply the fp option it doesn't complain about the font path
but still complains about the font I have symlinks from usrlib to the 
place where my distribution lives

Try to run Xsun under truss

	The best way to do this is by logging in over the network
	and typing

	truss t open Xsun

openoptXRlibXfontsmiscfontsdir ORDONLY

This will give you and idea of where Xsun things the fonts should be

If you have defined  a project root and done a make install everything
should have gone right by default even without symbolic links

following happens 

PROGRAM

           int x
 

	   printfenter x  
           scanfd x
           printfx  dn x 

        

OUTPUT 

	The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement When I type
in a value like  then all the printf's output comes out at one time


Is there any other way besides using PIPES to do this ie like ioctl or something else 

Thanks

Batten down the hatches hide the women and lock up the cows XV  has
finally escaped  

It really bums me out that xv went shareware

  XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only  You may use XV for your own
                       
                       What does this mean anyway  Can I sit in a company
                       and look at pictures off the net in my spare time

  amusement and if you find it nifty useful generally cool or of
  some value to you your nondeductable donation would be greatly
  appreciated   is the suggested donation though of course
  larger donations are quite welcome  Folks who donate  or more
  can receive a Real Nice bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
  charge
 
  Commercial government and institutional users MUST register their
  copies of XV for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just  per
  workstationX terminal  Site licenses are available for those who
  wish to run XV on a large number of machines  Contact the author
  for more details

Now since universities are institutions right doesn't this mean that
most everyone in the world is affected by this  I don't believe there
are that many running X windows at home yet relatively speaking

Can the author legally sell xv  Xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed
by others  Did the author get permission to sell these works  Did
the author also get permission from all the people who contributed to
xv to sell their work as well

My guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author
maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product
and support for xv will begin to slide downhill

If this is the case then that's a bummer  I really liked xv

    Hello X'ers

I have a problem I am not able to create a window with  bit planes The
following code illustrates the problem

include stdioh
include XXlibh
include XXutilh

main

        Display display
        Window win
        XVisualInfo vinfo
        Colormap colormap

                vinfo
        if status
                fprintfstderrVisual not foundn
                exit
        
        colormapXCreateColormapdisplayDefaultRootWindowdisplay
                vinfovisualAllocNone

        attributescolormapcolormap

        winXCreateWindowdisplayDefaultRootWindowdisplay
                InputOutputvinfovisualCWColormapattributes
        XMapWindowdisplaywin
        for 
                XNextEventdisplayevent
        


I tried this with an SGI with  plane TrueColor server and with an HP
  plane DirectColor server with the obviously neccessary change
both running XR On the client side I have tried with XR Xlib on
HP  and DECstation and with XR Xlib on DECstation All the
combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request

As far as I can tell from the manual the only attribute which may give
a BadMatch is the colormap if it belongs to a wrong visual But the
visual was correctly matched as I did not get the error message What
am I doing wrong For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the
same error

 I'm trying to create a button that has both a label and a bitmap using
 the MenuButton widget  Is this possible  Right now all I get is the
 bitmap  no sign of the label

That's expected The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the
MenuButton section of the Athena Widget Set  C Language Interface
documentation states

      bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label

One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap
resource but remember that you or a user of your application won't be able
to set it from a resource file Also the button won't automatically be the
size of the bitmap The bitmap will be tiled if necessary or you could set the
button's dimensions to match its size

Wasn't the shareware fee a suggestion by John
Is so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to
honour it and part with money  Personally if I was in his position I would
do exactly the same thing John has obviously put in lot of time and effort
into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it

Just my pennies worth

Keep up the good work John

The MOTIF application consists of multiple Transient shells as children 
of a single TopLevel shell

      
 AppShell   TopLevelShell  TransientShell

While a Transient shell is poppedup my application modifies the 
sensitivity of a button in the TopLevel shell which is hidden by the 
Transient shell window  When the Transient shell is poppeddown the 
button sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged 
ie solidshaded  Subsequent selection of the button causes the 
text to revert to the correct visual state

When tracing event messages sent to the application many of the events 
seen under mwm are not present under OpenWindows

If anyone has any suggestions or solutions please post or send me mail
  Thanks

  gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request
 
 As far as I can tell from the manual the only attribute which may give
 a BadMatch is the colormap if it belongs to a wrong visual But the
 visual was correctly matched

I got several answers the most complete was from Errol Crary 
errolctvtvTekcom
I have just looked at the R server listings mitserverdixwindowc 
and there are several ways in which you can get a BadMatch error even
though my O'Reilly book only says BorderWidth is nonzero for InputOnly

 if class  InputOnly  bw    depth  


  Find out if the depth and visual are acceptable for this Screen 


 if vmask  CWBorderPixmap  CWBorderPixel   
    class  InputOnly 
    depth  pParentdrawabledepth


 if vmask  CWColormap   
    class  InputOnly 
    visual  ancwoptvisual  ancwoptcolormap  None


So 
case  is InputOnly which is not your case  it seems to be the
     O'Reilly case
Case  should not be the case since you got the visual for the screen
Case  looks suspicious you are giving no CWBorder in the attribute
     mask and since the visual is not the parent depth I would suspect you
     need to supply a border pixel from the new colormap you are going to use
     for this window
Case  does not seem to be the problem since you do supply the CWColormap
     in the attributes

                             Thanks for your help

 It really bums me out that xv went shareware

xv's been shareware for about a year  hadn't you noticed
I don't have a problem with this  John Bradley has put a hell
of a lot of work into xv and if he feels that it's time to get
some monetary reward from it that's surely his right

 Can the author legally sell xv  Xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed
 by others  Did the author get permission to sell these works

Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG
code which are right there in the xv distribution you would have
observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware
and commercial software  Sam Leffler's libtiff copyright also grants
permission for unrestricted use including resale

 My guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author
 maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product

Commercial  There's a big difference between a polite request
for a voluntary donation and commercial it'sillegaltocopythis
andwe'llsicourlawyersonyou software

I do agree that John's readme file could be a little clearer about
what he means by personal use

I am in the process of modifying an X application that uses Xlib  I'd

You have to do the same sorts of things that Xt does with its main loop
That is you have to rig up a timer queue and you have to put a 
select or poll call in your main loop  You can obtain the 
file descriptor of the X display connection using 
    fd  ConnectionNumber display

The functionality of the main loop dispatcher in Xt is quite useful
The good news is you can get the source and plagiarize

I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MITMAGICCOOKIE on my servers
CPU heads HPRX Xterminals but I'm running into a couple of problems

First at least one of our applications Maple doesn't seem to understand 
how to deliver the magic cookie and won't run on a display with authorization
turned on 

Second we have people with client software on remote machines and I
really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their Xauthority
file to the remote machine assuming that the clients there support
Xauthorization

So what I would like to do is turn on MITMAGICCOOKIE by default with
nonprivileged users able to turn it off  dropping back to hostbased
authorization

Yes I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the
heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals but
nonprivileged users can't do this

I've checked with the HP Support Line and there doesn't appear to be a way
Can anyone confirm this or do you know of a way to accomplish what I
want

BTW I'm running HPUX  and Vue 

Thanks in advance

The O'Reilly Xlib Programming Manual vol  says on page 
   Only one client can select button events on any one window at one time

I am having the problem of ensuring pointtofocus when the mouse
cursor enters a window in my application  I'm using InterViews
but that may not matter this seems to be a generic problem in X
For example I use OpenWindows on a Sparc with pointtofocus
set and that generally works but not always depending on what
was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell
tool window to another  Or so it seems

My question then is what can I do within X to guarantee pointto
focus within my application  Thanks for any response

XNewsreader TIN version  PL


I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux
system

 It must be free
 It must run on standard monochrome X with a small screen size x
  No motifopenlook etc
 It must compile under Linux with gccg Most generic unix software
  works ok
 It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents
  with dvips Or just tell me another free program that converts one
  of the supported formats to ps
 It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size scrollable

I know of several such programs idraw xfig tgif I have
no experience with any of them Features I would like in the programs are

 ability to draw circles arcs straight lines boxes and arrows
 support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects
 support for texts in any size
 ability to movecopyresizerotate any part of the drawing
 ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component
  eg a transistor symbol composed of three lines an arrow and a circle
 any aid numeric coordinates screen grid to align parts of the drawing
 less essential but in fact very handy preservation of connection
  If I move one part of the drawing the lines that connect that part to the
  rest of the drawing stay connected

Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to
draw electronic schematics flow charts logic diagrams data flow diagrams
and block diagrams with it 

I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my
whishlist and are there any other programs How demanding are the programs
with respect to disk space memory and CPU usage Are any of the programs
known to work on Linux with monochrome X

                          The Andrew Consortium
          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon 
                         is pleased to announce

                          AUIS  for AIX
                                 

The Andrew User Interface System version  our CDrom version was
developed for AIX  version  on the IBM RS and many other
platforms  To accomodate AIX version  we have created a patch to
the sources  The patch and accompanying instructions for its
application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymousftp from the
internet host emsworthandrewcmuedu  in the directory
aixpatch  For those without internet access a  diskette can be
ordered for  by sending or faxing a purchase order to the address
below 

The base  system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the
same host

Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows
AUIS to compile under AIX



The Andrew User Interface System AUIS is a comprehensive environment
on top of X windows in which you can create use and mail multimedia
applications and documents   A major advantage of AUIS is the
capability to recursively embed objects  Thus one can edit text that
not only contains multiple fonts indentation and other typography but
also  contains embedded raster images spreadsheets drawing editors
equations simple animations and so on These embedded objects can
themselves contain other objects including text

AUIS has three components

    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set
    of applications beginning with the ez text editor a help
    system a system monitoring tool an editorbased shell
    interface and other editors corresponding to the various
    available types of objects 

    The Andrew Toolkit ATK is a portable objectoriented
    userinterface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein
    objects can be embedded in oneanother  With the toolkit
    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as
    easily as those that come with the system 

    The Andrew Message System AMS provides a multimedia interface
    to mail and bulletinboards  AMS supports several mail
    management strategies and implements many advanced  features
    including authentication return receipts automatic sorting of
    mail vote collection and tabulation enclosures audit trails
    of related messages and subscription management It also
    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
    lowfunction personal computers in addition to highfunction
    workstations 

The current public release of Andrew Version   includes support for
the new Internet MIME Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions standards
for multipart multimedia mail  A newer release  for members of
the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new
editors for drawings images fonts and user preferences


Remote Andrew Demo Service

You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew
Demo Service  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X
window system  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents navigate
through the interactive Andrew Tour and use the Andrew Message System
to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and
newsgroups

To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service simply run the
following command on your machine

	finger helpatkitccmuedu

The service will give you further instructions

REPOST

I have two questions well probably more about how Expose  Configure
events are handled

I have an appl which uses  window to draw in  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized I made a translation table for the Expose  Configure events
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method  The rescale method invokes a fake Expose
event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate Expose struct
to draw the data

Quest 
When the appl is compiledlinked w R running in either R or R env
I get multiple  redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed  I assume I'm getting cascading events  Is that right
Any suggestions as to how to handletrap events in a better way

Quest 
When the appl is compiledlinked w R I get no Expose events
whatsoever  Do events andor translation tables act differently in R

Thanks in advance

Hi

I have an application which draws graphs bar charts etc I need to include

the graphs from within the applictaion by clicking on a print button I am 
not sure if I can invoke xwd  xpr from within my application and specify
the window id to get my window dump and then send this file for printing or 
if there are other ways of doing this I would appreciate any help in this

generically compile XV on iSVRArchitecture  Also rand and srand
don't work very welluse lrand and seed to get better results
Otherwise xv compiles just fine on my Esix System V  box
with XFree and gcc  I just uncommented the gcc definition in

   Wasn't the shareware fee a suggestion by John
   Is so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to
   honour it and part with money  Personally if I was in his position I would
   do exactly the same thing John has obviously put in lot of time and effort
   into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it

It is interesting to look at the changes of mind that John has had

The AUTHOR file for xgif an early incarnation of xv reads in part 
as follows

  Do whatever you want with this program though it would be nice if my name
  remained on it somewhere  Other than that it may be freely modified
  distributed and used to fill up disk space

The README file for xv   reads in part as follows

  NOTE  If you like the program and decide to use it please send me a short
  email message to that effect  Be sure to mention the full name of your
  organization  When our sponsors ask us 'what have you been doing' it would
  be most handy to be able to come up with a nice long list of organizations
  that are using code developed in the GRASP Lab  Brownie points as
  it were

The README file for xv  reads in part as follows

  Also if you find XV to be nifty useful generally 'cool' and of
  some value to you your donation not taxdeductable would be greatly
  appreciated   US is probably a fine amount to donate
  Folks who donate  and up will receive a nice bound copy of the XV Manual
  printed on a spiffo dpi laser printer  It'll look lovely mounted over
  your fireplace

Which looks to me as a suggestion see Julian's comment above

  larger donations are quite welcome  Folks who donate  or more
  can receive a printed bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
  charge  If you want one just ask  BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE VERSION
  OF XV THAT YOU ARE USING

  Commercial government and institutional users MUST register their
  copies of XV for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just  per

  wish to run XV on a large number of machines  Contact the author
  for more details

The second paragraph to me says that universities MUST register and
pay a potentially large sum of money

One way to mask the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the
XAddEventHandler send to your eventhandling function in your case it is the
showmouseposition function 

If the XEvent arrive in this function as 

XEvent pevent

then the value of peventxbuttonbutton is the button that was pressed So 
you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them In case
it was not clear peventxeventbutton is an int 

By the way you mentioned the ButtonMotionMask and if anyone can help me with 
these MotionMasks I would be grateful I can not figure out how do distinguish
between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring In 
essence I would like an seperate eventhandler for motion with each button 
Unfortunately the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the 
value of the pressed button

Any ideas

Summary Go ahead swamp me  EEP

I'm not familiar at all with the format of these XFace thingies but
after seeing them in some folks' headers I've got to see them and
maybe make one of my own

I've got dpgview on my Linux box which displays uncompressed XFaces
and I've managed to compile uncompface too but now that I'm looking
for them I can't seem to find any XFace's in anyones news headers  

Could you would you please send me your XFace header

I know I'll probably get a little swamped but I can handle it

	I hope

I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif but I'm hoping
is really just a mistake on my part  Does anyone know anything about
this problem

 I am using an XmTextField and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded
  text string ascii or Kanji either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString
  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed the text is getting
  truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables
  LANG more specifically LCALL  When they are set to japanese
  the text gets truncated  When they are set to english everything
  works fine  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns
  Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual
   application just in my sample code to make things easier
	
 I am running Motif  XR via HPUX  My test program is set up
  to handle  bit Kanji characters  I have remembered to do   
  XtSetLanguageProc prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources
  are set to japanese fonts

 Don't know if this matters but my dialog box and TextField is initially
  created with UIL 


The problem does NOT happen with XmText  Unfortunately substituting
XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable
alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta

I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone
wants it  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not
properly allocating memory for japanese but since I don't have the
source to look at it is just a guess

Please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion
or if you want the sample program

THANKS

In article Apralexcom bryanalexcom Bryan Boreham writes
 
 The shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its
 positioning request  The windowmanager is not responding because
 it thinks the window is already in the right place
 
 Exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
 me all information greatly received

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows a misfeature of the X protocol and a bug in the Xt intrinsics  

The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the xy position given in
ReparentNotify events  Olwm is structured in such a way that when a window
is popped down the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event 
At this point the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date

If a SetValues is done using the same xy position the Intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it
there  However a misfeature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow
request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event  The
Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after
wmTimeout has expired  Actually things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the
same

The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the xy positioning information
in ReparentNotify events  This has been implemented and is available in XR
public fix   This is XBUG  for those of you who are interested in
gorier details

I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through
the XView xvget function

   x  int xvgetmyframe XVX
   y  int xvgetmyframe XVY

For example if I set XVX  XVY to  the frame comes up
in the correct position with the top left corner the size
handle at  xvget returns  as well But later on
xvget returns  without any intervening xvsetmyframe
XV My frame is fitted around a canvas and it turns out
by measuring on the screen that  is the position of the
first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin What
gives Any help most appreciated

PS On a related subject is there any way of querying the
window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around
frames etc

 Message Part  Text 
The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common
GUI But what does this mean exactly
 
 Do they mean that all COSEcomplient apps will have the Motif
  look and feel
 
 Do they mean that all COSEcomplient apps will use the Motif
  toolkit API
 
 Do they mean both of the above
 
 Is it possible that there will be a MotifAPI complient toolkit with
  an OpenLook Look  Feel
 
 How about an OLITXViewOIInterviews API toolkit with a Motif L  F
  I know OI already does this but will this be considered COSEcomplient
 
 Will there be more than one standard toolkit API or L  F supported
 
 How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif

Hi

Personally I like NeXTSTEP very much Even more when I realise how much a  
burden ordinary X or Windows programming is I also like ObjectiveC better  
than I like C

But sometimes the restrictions are there For instance it sometimes has to be  
MSWindows or X Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  
that come close to NeXTSTEP the appkit etc Also environs that support rapid  
prototyping like with IB without producing spaghetticode as soon as you want  
to do real work

Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects Interviews  
what it is exactly I don't know I kind of lost touch with that world when I  
started with NeXTSTEP

Thanks

I want to install an XR or XR server on my Sun and use xdm yes
we have xdm already running for other XTerminals to log in and start

Is there a ready to go binairy of the X server for my configuration
I have read something about Xsun or must I compile the X stuff by
myself

Hello

	I am admin for an RS running AIX  XR Motif and xdt
	I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTLALTBKSPC to exit X
	
	I've tried invoking X with 'xinit T' but that doesn't work
	xinit appends the T to the call to xinitrc and not to the
	call to X  

	The man page to xinit is no help  In fact it tells
	me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file  

	So far the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is
	to add the T to the call to X in usrlppXdefaultsxserverrc
	I would rather not do it this way  Does anyone have any other ideas

 It is interesting to look at the changes of mind that John has had

Very interested indeed This is against this kind of changes that the GNU
COPYLEFT is protecting us

Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv We were using it mostly for slide
shows because of its loop feature that display does not have display
from the wonderful ImageMagick package D but I think I will implement
it myself even a shellscript should do the job and forget xv

the server on the other machine is using a different colormap

I tried saving the colormap pixel and rgb values and on the redisplay
performed a table lookup against the new colormap  This didn't work
because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap

Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values or
is there a simpler way to solve this problem  I tried using xinitcolormap

 I posted this a few weeks back but all I got back was an error

   had a mode of   Arrghhh  

With renewed interest in setting the DISPLAY variable etc I
thought I would post my contribution

This Perl script is my solution  It trys to be intelligent about
what it's doing so that you should be able to type rx hostdomainetc
and get a xterm running on hostdomainetc with all the difficult
stuff taken care of

In theory this program can do everything you ever wanted to do
when you wanted to run a remote command in the background  it
doesn't even need to be an X program  Try a rx bigmachine make
for instance for a backgrounded make on the remote bigmachine

For more details and a full list of features read the README file

XSH SYNOPSIS
XB rx

XI username
X
XI host
X
XI command
X
Xbr
XB rxterm
X
XB l
XI username
X
XI host
X
XIR args

XSH DESCRIPTION
XThe 
XB rx
Xprogram connect to the specified
XI host
Xand executes the specified
XI command
Xin the background returning immediately  To allow the execution
Xof X programs it copies a number of environmental variables to
Xthe remote session  If you omit
XIR command 
Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host  The
XB rxterm
Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host and also passes
XI args
Xto the remote xterm as arguments
XPP
XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local
Xmachine while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote
Xmachine
XPP
XIf the name of the file from which
XB rx
Xis executed is anything other than rx''
XB rx
Xtakes this name stripped on a leading r'' as the command
Xto run on the remote host using any
XI command
Xparameters as arguments for the remote command
XPP
XIf
XB rx
Xthinks you are using
XB xauth
Xbased X authorisation and you are calling to a offsite host or
Xto a different username it will attempt to copy an authorization
Xkey to the remote account  Otherwise it will try to use
XB xhost
Xto grant access to the remote host
XSH OPTIONS
XTP
XBI l  username
XUse
XI username
Xas the remote username instead of your local username  In the absence
Xof this option the remote username is the same as your local username
X
XSH ENVIRONMENT
XIf set the values of PATH DISPLAY XENVIRONMENT XAPPLRESDIR
XXFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH OPENWINHOME LDLIBRARYPATH
Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program unless the
Xremote username is different or the remote host is offsite in which
Xcase only DISPLAY is exported with in all cases any variables named in the
Xvariable RXENV
XPP
XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate to contain as qualified
Xa hostname as is needed
XSH DIAGNOSTICS
XTP
XIB command  don't recognise my name
XB rx
Xcannot decode the name it has been called under  In this case
Xit prints a warning message and continues as normal
XTP
XB rx usage rx l username hostname args
XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it
XSH AUTHOR

XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the
XB gwm
Xdistribution  To distinguish this rx from other programs
Xwith similar names you should refer to this program as the
XB Glasgow
XBR rx 
XSH SEE ALSO
XX rsh xterm xauth xhost gwm
XSH BUGS
XB Rx
Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the
Xlocal user and the remote one depending on whether the remote
Xhost is onsite or not and whether an alternative username was used
Xor not
XPP
XIn particular if either the locally used shell or the remotely
Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell
XB sh
Xthen strange things are more likely to happen  Especially when 
Xit's only one of them
XPP
XSometimes quoting can get messed up
XPP
XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in
XB rx
Xto make it believe something that is not true and fail because of it
XPP
XWhen
XB rx
Xuses
XB xhost
Xto grant access the
XB xhost
Xcommand may fail silently
XPP
XIf
XB rx
Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine it will
Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh  If this happens you
Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment

X
X remote execution of X programs  Based on a script in an old version of gwm
X
X To install put rx in your bin and make rxterm a link to it
X  Some configuration will be necessary see CONFIG comments
X
X More and more this is less and less like the original
X
X Major hacked to work for ourmy set up and also partly
X  rewritten to work with sh rather than ksh
X
X Maybe I'll turn this into our first zsh script
X
X Looks like it turned into a perl script at some point  big improvement
X
X This code tries to be intelligent in the way it works  This means there
X  are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in
X  These assumptions are all valid on the machines I use and in my
X  environment  At the same time I try to make as few assumptions as possible
X  about the remote machine  Here's a list of all the more tricky ones
X  That the remote machine has csh  Linux
X  That RSHELL  binksh  remote shell  binksh  Make same
X  If remote shell  sh that PATH is compatible  Use csh etc
X  I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be but does it
X    know what to do with a cookie eat it
X  There must be others
X
X Why am I using csh to run the remote commands  Simply because it doesn't
X  interact badly with rsh and hang waiting for a file descriptor to
X  be closed  I'd rather use zsh or bash or even perl but they are not
X  as universal as csh

X   Fortunately all my X programs are in an arch independant place and
X    so it shouldn't cos a problem locally
X   We check against RSHELL because they might be running another shell
X    differant from their login shell  I know sounds weird but it's too
X    common round here
X   I've also included ksh in the braindamage cos I can't see an easy way
X    to pass throught ENVENV without it being too late We only have
X    one person who has ksh as a login shell anyway
X   Oh yeah we are assuming that if it's bourne shell here then it's

We are planning on buying  X Terminals  I have the article from Jim
Morton regarding prices etc and am looking for any other information
that will help me decide which to buy

The terminals will be connected to a DEC  AXP with Mb RAM
running OSF  From what I have found out so far it would be best to run
as much as possible in the terminal itself X window manager xterm
etc and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal
where n ranges from  to  depending on who I talk to

What should I be looking for  What sort of questions should I be asking
the salespeople

Thanks

   We have a requirement for dynamically closing and opening
different display servers within an X application in a manner such
that at any time there is only one display associated with the client

   Assumming a proper cleanup is done during the transition should

 I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif but I'm hoping
 is really just a mistake on my part  Does anyone know anything about
 this problem
 
  I am using an XmTextField and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded
   text string ascii or Kanji either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString
   The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed the text is getting
   truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables
   LANG more specifically LCALL  When they are set to japanese
   the text gets truncated  When they are set to english everything
   works fine  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns
   Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual
    application just in my sample code to make things easier
 	
  I am running Motif  XR via HPUX  My test program is set up
   to handle  bit Kanji characters  I have remembered to do   
   XtSetLanguageProc prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources
   are set to japanese fonts
 
  Don't know if this matters but my dialog box and TextField is initially
   created with UIL 
 
 
 The problem does NOT happen with XmText  Unfortunately substituting
 XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable
 alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta
 
 I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone
 wants it  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not
 properly allocating memory for japanese but since I don't have the
 source to look at it is just a guess

The problem was that TextField was improperly walking the string it used
the character count instead of the byte count a significan Oops 
The problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic
patch from HP support services

My question is this  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock andor NumLock is

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th
Keypress event  Of course if there is some reason why you need to
always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the
keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root
window  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have
been pressed

An even more pointed question Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard  ie CapsLock is active and the user
presses shifta I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'

I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString
You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses
as you like  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from
the Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit

 If I use Xt all 
 O'Reilly has to say is 'is automatically handled by Xt'  If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent I get nothing  This all stems from problems with users of 
 the Sun  keyboard and the NumLock plus various AltMetaetc modifier 
 requirements

That's not all it says  The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 
of Volume Four or chap  in older Athena editions where there is about 
 pages on how to specify translations to capture
various combinations of keys or buttons

The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage
of how that works in Volume One  chapter   You should read this
to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything
complicated

We are making a transition from NextStep to Xwindows I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same each salesman will beg to differ I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are The tools I have looked at so far are UIMX Xdesigner TeleUse tcltkInterviews and SUIT 
So far I've drawn the following conclusions

 The builder for Interviews is not very mature bad docs
 TeleUse is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit
 UIMX  Xdesigner seem about the same even though Xdesigner does not have a interpreter I'll by Centerline if I need one
 tcltk is a little buggy
 I know very little about the ICS Builder just have the sales info
 Due to a corporate agreement Xdesigner is much cheeper than any other comercial product
 For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them well different money
 We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work
 this type of tool seems great but noone seems to talk about them on the net Is there another news group for this 
 SUIT cost too much for comercial development

I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products

I just got a bug report and a fix for this exact problem from
fisheriscpbellcorecom Greg Fisher

  the most serious problem I have identified has not
 been incorporated  This problem occurs when the Table widget's
 GeometryManager is invoked by a child  This will work correctly if
 the table widgets parent complies with the Xt protocols  However if
 they do not as is the case for some Motif widgets and they ignore
 XtCWQueryOnly then the sizing will be incorrect
         In order to see this problem the following events must
 happen
  A child of the table widget must request a new size
  The table widget must query its parent for a new size having set
    XtCWQueryOnly
  The parent must ignore the XtCWQueryOnly bit and resize the table
    widget  As part of the resize XmpTableForgetProposedLayout is
    called  This will set twtablecurrentcols and
    twtablecurrentrows to zero
  The table will continue setting up the new size working under the
    assumption that it is working with a proposed and not actual
    layout  At the end it will call XmpTableSaveProposedLayout  This
    will save twtablecols and twtablerows and restore their
    values from twtablecurrentcols and twtablecurrentrows
    However these have already been set to zero
  Since the table widget has already been resized it will not need a
    second resize
  Next another widget managed by some ancestor of the table is
    resized  This results in the parent of the table requesting the
    tables preferred size  Since twtablecols and twtablerows are
    zero this will return x as the preferred size
  The parent is very likely to grant this request resulting in a
    loss of the whole table from the display
 

He isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely
correct  Here is the new implementation of XmpTableNewProposedLayout
which will be released with the next update in  weeks

XmpTablec

void XmpTableNewProposedLayout tw 
    XmpTableWidget tw

    XmpTableConsiderSameSize       tw 
    XmpTableProposedColsAndRows    tw 
    XmpTableQueryParentForResize   tw      query only no resize 

    
      Since we only made a query we should still need to continue
      However Motif is broken so that we actually may already have
      been resized  In that case the proposed layout is already
      forgotten so we should just quietly exit
     
    if  twtableresizestatus  RSdueToRequest 
    
        XmpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth  tw 
        XmpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight tw 
        XmpTableGetProposedChildSize   tw 
        XmpTableSaveProposedLayout     tw 
    
     else the resize has already been done  Our proposed layout would
      have been forgotten in the process
     


The XpTable the fix is identical except of course for the names

XpTablec

void XpTableNewProposedLayout  tw 
    XpTableWidget  tw

    XpTableConsiderSameSize       tw 
    XpTableProposedColsAndRows    tw 
    XpTableQueryParentForResize   tw      query only no resize 
    
      Since we only made a query we should still need to continue
      However some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may
      already have  been resized  In that case the proposed layout
      is already forgotten so we should just quietly exit
     
    if  twtableresizestatus  RSdueToRequest 
    
        XpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth  tw 
        XpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight tw 
        XpTableGetProposedChildSize   tw 
        XpTableSaveProposedLayout     tw 
    
     else the resize has already been done  Our proposed layout would
      have been forgotten in the process

Just create the window in the place you want it and set the program
position field in the WMNORMALHINTS property then map it

Then assuming they have a non brain dead window manager the user can
say whether they want to us program specified positions or not For
tvtwm the UsePPosition command in the tvtwmrc will do this

Now I'm sure that by the time this message gets out of our local news
timewarp someone will have advised you to set the user position bit in
the WMNORMALHINTS Donot do this It's evil It's a disservice to

Hi

I am using xdm on XR with OW and Xview on Suns and SPARCs running 
SunOS   Prior to using xdm I used to set PATH and other environment
variables like MANPATH HELPPATH ARCH etc in my login file  With xdm
the login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm
rootwindow nor my applications know about these variables

I used the DisplayManageruserPath resource in usrlibXxdmxdmconfig
to succesfully pass the PATH variable  But I am having problems passing anything else  I tried execing HOMElogin in usrlibXxdmXsession
but that didn't help  I also tried using
	DisplayManagerexportList HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH
which didn't work either

I would appreciate any help on this matter

Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows
in a number of applications  We are trying to use action translation
tables to implement this  We have only succeeded by assigning the
translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single
application  The Xt calls we make are included below

It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation
table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations
and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications  If someone could
describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated

What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas   

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself To give you a realworld example here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly  people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other It's not too much of a load on our
Ethernet with maybe  concentrators so you have  people on each
segment If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself Say you have a 
 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card If you have
 people running programs off it you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on effectively a  MHz  Of course DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have  working programs running you'll know it


Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year  The link I want to use 
though ISDN K is costly and the bandwidth limited  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group I'll take the
liberty of responding to some of this  If you really want Tom to reply
you should send mail to supportqdeckcom

A k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the mbps
ethernet that we typically run  How restrictive it will be depends on 
what you run and how you run it  I would think that a couple of instances
of some really nasty program like Smoking Clover would make the link 
useless for anyone else  On the other hand probably  xclocks quietly
updating every  seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much  In the real
world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes

Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis I wouldn't want to have
to share that k link with more than  other people

Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run  people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth

Hmmm  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  Are you
running any standard MSWindows programs like Word   What sort of 
packets go blazing through What size link do you have Mb or Mb 
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other  The usage patterns are not very
good predictors of how yours will behave  The only one of our low bandwidth
links that normally get used in this way is a k link to Ireland that they
often use to run a DOS text based client end of a clientserver database 
remotely from the DVX machine behind me Since the server end is or was always
at this end California it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview
X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having
a long hop to the server  As I warned you this tells us very little about
how you usage pattern will fill a k ISDN link

Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent
Let's break it into pieces and look at it  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy
and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X Popping up a menu is a
little more involved and will generate some traffic  Restoring the screen
that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be  Does the server
that it's displaying on have backing store  If so and the server had enough
memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network
traffic If no backing store then what was being covered up  If it was a 
solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite
easily  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren  Stimpy we may have to send
it back to the X server bit by bit  DVX will do its level best to only redraw
that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be 
repainted  Assuning a x screen with  bits per pixel that's  bits
that has to be sent  Worst possible case you're looking at about  seconds
In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts 
that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls



It all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you're going
to see a slowdown from Xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also
 

What do you mean by network things  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DVX protocol in transferring these 
images with Xcalls and displaying them on a client's machine

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network  It's 
pretty good for this  X programs are best DOS text programs are almost
as good since we conert them to X easily  Something like WinX is a hybrid
We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver mouse driver
keyboard driver and convert them to X  The calls Windows is making are in
no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network  We go to a 
lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can but
we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications
tell us

I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux
system

 It must be free
 It must run on standard monochrome X with a small screen size x
  No motifopenlook etc
 It must compile under Linux with gccg Most generic unix software
  works ok
 It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents
  with dvips Or just tell me another free program that converts one
  of the supported formats to ps
 It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size scrollable

I know of several such programs idraw xfig tgif I have
no experience with any of them Features I would like in the programs are

 ability to draw circles arcs straight lines boxes and arrows
 support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects
 support for texts in any size
 ability to movecopyresizerotate any part of the drawing
 ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component
  eg a transistor symbol composed of three lines an arrow and a circle
 any aid numeric coordinates screen grid to align parts of the drawing
 less essential but in fact very handy preservation of connection
  If I move one part of the drawing the lines that connect that part to the
  rest of the drawing stay connected

Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to
draw electronic schematics flow charts logic diagrams data flow diagrams
and block diagrams with it 

I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my
whishlist and are there any other programs How demanding are the programs
with respect to disk space memory and CPU usage Are any of the programs
known to work on Linux with monochrome X

In the list you mentioned tgif handles everything except rotation and
any size text  It only supports  degrees rotation  Currently it
supports  XR standard font sizes  However it allows arbitrary
scaling of the entire drawing  Effectively it allows any font sizes but
you can only have  different sizes per drawing

Tgif takes up K compiled with O option on a SPARCstation  I was told
that it compiles under Linux but I haven't tried it yet  It works with
both color and monochrome X

	Greetings
	We have a network of  Sun Workstations running SunOS 
and Openwindows    of these are Sun 's that we have modified to
run Seth Robertson's xkernel image effectively turning them into
xterminals  We use xdm XR to manage the displays

	When we had  xkernel machines things worked fine but when
we installed  more last weekend we appear to have found a weakness
With  clients to  Sparc  the Sparc  window manager is eventually
getting munged  

	Let me try to be precise  The user sitting at the machine
that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having
control of his keyboard and screen yanked away  When this was the
department chair it was kind of cute  We poked at xdm for a few
days and are satisfied that it is not at fault  Our current theory is
that olwm the Sun version was not meant for running multiple copies
on one machine which is what happens  the console user runs olwm
and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal
server 

	Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior
	Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory
	How about obvious gimmes
	And of course any ideas on how to solve it

	Any ideas are greatly appreciated

We're looking at various X clients for PC's and we're looking for some
information about the relative efficiency of different products  Are any
notably efficient fast  Are any notably inefficient  I assume that a
Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster right now I'm looking
at ico running on Xoftware for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCPIP
platform and it's not surprisingly much slower than ico running on the
Sparc's console  What are the key ways of improving performance for
PC presumably Windows clients

Also what about async solutions  Yes I appreciate that it will be 
much slower even with Vbis  I'm in the process of installing PPP
with header compression  How does that compare to cslip  I've seen
a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient but
are there comparable products out there  If we're looking for efficiency
for async PC clients what should we be looking at in addition to standard
PPP w compression and XRemote

Any information would be greatly appreciated  I'm still taking in all
the information in the faq but any tips about the relative efficiency
of various product offerings would be great  I get the impression
that discussions about speed are largely application specific but
that not withstanding any comments would be appreciated  Thanks

With X I have to do something like

Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv We were using it mostly for slide

from the wonderful ImageMagick package D but I think I will implement
it myself even a shellscript should do the job and forget xv

 I am using xdm on XR with OW and Xview on Suns and SPARCs running

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your everytime shell rcfile
instead of your loginonly one which is fair enough if you only have a few
users who know what they're doing  If you have several hundred users who do
what the books tell them though then it's confusing at best  Another is to
have your xterms run login shells but that still leaves the window manager
and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment

Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts
it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell and has it then run the
rest of the startup scripts  That way the user's usual environment gets set
up as normal and inherited by everything  You can find an almostcurrent copy

Greetings

I am developing an application that allows a user to interactively
createeditview a visual model ie topology of their network and
I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task

In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIMX product to develop other
GUIs so I am familiar with UIMSs in general

The topology will support objects and connecting links  Once the
topology is created I want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping zooming etc

I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing
routines to accomplish this  Specifically the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult and certainly time consuming  if I have
to roll my own

xvertext provides you with several functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window previous versions were limited to vertical text 

What's new since 

o Existing bitmap fonts can be magnified to give reasonable fonts at large
  sizes
o Bounding boxes can be obtained
o The GC's stipple bitmap is honoured
o Font IDs can be cached when font names are unavailable
o An Imakefile is present
o The demos are better including a ransom note like the 
  compsourcespostscript one

Where can I get it

Why did X designers decide to not associate
the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the
display it is being drawn on

In X the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing
requests  that is the server's drawing model was stateless

This caused problems with performance and network traffic
so the X redesign included the graphic context to codify
the drawing state  Most application designers who want to
draw things in several different colors create a GC for
each color during initialization then pass the GC id in
each drawing request

For more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article
in the  ACM Transactions on Graphics

Hi

is there any scriptprogramthelike already existing which could transform
the output of xperfcomp a huge table into a nice d'ish diagram or
graph by producing postscript output from xperfcomp input 

Maybe someone has already written such beast

Will there be no chance to get the Author of this REALLY superb program
to remove the 'institutional' point in his license statement 
Or at least to say 'except educational ones' at this 

I understand that use of this software by either commercial or governmental
users should be result in a donation to its creator but the everytime
rare on money universities schools or whatever else institutions should
not be restricted

If the situation stays as is and the Author explicitely states that
he treats universities and schools as institutions in this context
i'll have to fallback to xv  here Maybe our disk capacity will
soon be dead when every user has a copy of xv in his home dir

 How do I view eps files on X I have an image in color encapsulated
 postscript and need to view it on my screen

	Several ways are available  pageview which I think came
with our system so I can't point ghostview with ghostscript and
the new xv  package all do so  I recommend the latter two
especially xv if you want to do any conversion

 Are there any utilities that will let me convert between encapsulated
 postscript and plain postscript
	I'm not sure offhand but I will attempt to mail you the
complangpostscript FAQ which has a list of utilities

Hi all

I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window
to show some drawings This works perfectly for all kind of objects
expect large fonts What happens on the screen is that the right
half of the font is not shown The way I create these things is
quite simple some aggregated code

XFillRectangleDisp Pixs AnyColor   Width Height
XDrawLineRectString
XCopyAreaDisp Pixs Win   Width Height  

I am using a RSK  with BOS 

The question is
  is this a bug in the AIX Xserver may be some PTFs or did I do
  something wrong within my code

Sorry for the crossposting but I really do not know what kind of
error it is

 Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify
 a color for drawing like
 
 Drawpointxycolor or Drawlinexyxycolor or
 Fillrectanglexyxycolor 
 
 With X I have to do something like 
 XSetForegroundcurrentcolor
 XDrawPointdwxy
 
 Why split this into two functions Why did X designers decide to not associate
 the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the
 display it is being drawn on

For flexibility Anyway what you say is not really true The color information
is associated with a GraphicsContext not with a display and the GC IS
a parameter to the drawing routines

So if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of
width  you can make  GCs for those cases and then simply do

XDrawLinedpywingcredxyxy
XDrawLinedpywingcbluexyxy

for this effect

This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer but also much
more efficient and flexible You would not include all the other parameters
like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every
drawing call so why do it for color  BTW stay away from XDrawPoint
if you don't really need it to draw RANDOM points for image transfers
there are Image routines

EPS IS plain postscript It is only wrapped by some comments and stripped
of any dubious commands for compatibility You can simply do



save gsave
showpage  def

 Include eps file here

grestore restore

showpage

 end of file

and this way show it on it's natural page position and size

Programs may use the BoundingBox comment in the EPS file to do
arbitrary scale rotate and translate to include it in more complicated
ways than above

I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something
Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment

I am running a hp with hpux  VUE and XR using Xt anbd Xaw

What I did until now
I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize I passed as a applicationclass name 'commandWidgetClass'
Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and
passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues
When I call XtRealizeWidget I get a window of the specified size but I have no idea how I can draw something in it

Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets 
In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not 

Thanks very much in advance

The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and noncommercial
widgets is the ICS Widget Data book  ICS sells the widgets for various
prices  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery 

The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing where 
you pay some nominal fee get a cd with the widgets and then you 
can use the public domain widgets freely and selectively activate 
widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them 
The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets
such as those used in dataviews  I dont know there pricing schemes
but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex 
widgets especially if you only one customer to distribute to 

This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their 
databook catalog  and it looked impressive lots o' widgets there

I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them
hope this helps you

I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change  
Dartmouth will not be able to run xv  and I'm probably going

I have a SPARC with  CGSIX cards in it  I'd like
to have the R server recognize the second card


I mknod created a devcgsix device but when I brought up the
server the second device was ignored  

How do I setup the second card


Note  If I borrow a cgthree card and put a cgthree and
a cgsix card in the same SPARC box the R server finds
the second card I then set the DISPLAY to the
second card and start a second window manager  

Worse case is I trade cards with someone but maybe someone
out there has seen this problem already


email is preferred post if you must

Thanks in advance


Jim

 Hello
 
 We want to configure our XR sytem i Mhz running BSDlike UNIX

 An 'X indirect machine' works very well
 The configuration

You need to start the Xserver with indirect itsname

If you start it with indirect localhost it use the loopback adress as
it's adress So when it try to contact another host this one try to answer
on its loopback adress Not good

Remember that every machine has the adress  on the loopback network

Rather than write my own can anyone direct me to a package that will let me create
cascaded popup menus in X windows  For reasons of portability the package should 
not rely on any X toolkit other than XLib and the XT Intrinsics  Something written
in C would be nice too

 I got several answers the most complete was from Errol Crary 
 errolctvtvTekcom
 I have just looked at the R server listings mitserverdixwindowc 
 and there are several ways in which you can get a BadMatch error even
 though my O'Reilly book only says BorderWidth is nonzero for InputOnly

As of the third edition June  the O'Reilly book Vol  under
XCreateWindow says

BadMatch
	Any invalid setting of a window attribute
	Attribute besides wingravity eventmask donotpropogatemask
	    overrideredirect or cursor specified for InputOnly window

Greetings

I am developing an application that allows a user to interactively
createeditview a visual model ie topology of their network and
I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task

In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIMX product to develop other
GUIs so I am familiar with UIMSs in general

The topology will support objects and connecting links  Once the
topology is created I want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping zooming etc

I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing
routines to accomplish this  Specifically the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult and certainly time consuming  if I have
to roll my own

Suggestions

greg

You don't mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget NetEd 
which does exactly what you want to do Cost is nominal  or so  call your
local office  The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard
rumblings of porting to Sun etc so it may be worth the check

Hi I've just installed the new XArchie  and it all works
fine except

on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the
program don't work at all but on the BW terminal it works fine
I can set the icon to an xbm file with twmrc but that doesn't
give the neato change when busy action Other programs with
similar actions eg xmail xbiff work fine

The Xinterface author George Ferguson suggests it might be a
problem with the X intrinsics but isn't willing to hack around
to fix it himself But I know zero about X programming so I
don't think I can find it 

Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem

Will someone who can 'see' the XFace included in this header please reply
and tell me if it turned out okay

I'm not all too sure about my viewing software  I handconverted this
thing in vi from a Sun rasterfile what a pain

For folks who haven't the slightest it went like this



		How to Make Your Own XFace
		   in xF Easy Steps

	 Scan my Drivers' License into a PCX file
	 Use WinGIF to 'trim' my face out of the license
		'reduce' it by half and
		convert it to BMP
	 Use Paintbrush to touch up manually
	 Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half again
	 Use Paintbrush to touch up again
	 Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half again
		and convert it to GIF

		now over to the UNIX side

	 Use Snapshot to convert the GIF to a Sun rasterfile
	 Use IconEdit to touch it up and
		convert it to an X bitmap
	 Use vi yes a text editor to manually convert
		the rasterfile into the Uncompressed XFace format
		Lots of global ed commands and by the time you're
		 done you'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep

		now over to the Linux side

	A Use compface to convert it to what you see here

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXetarZ on
exportlcsmitedu  and arjunanclacuk 

The significant change this time and the justification for the hike
in the major version number is

  o undo has been implemented

    By default only the last change can be undone but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many including unlimited
    levels of undo information should be kept Also undo of undo is
    supported

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe  

                          

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features amongst other things

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xtermlike keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences resources
   o both brief and comprehensive online help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xawd widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe ie without the Tcl and
Xawd options on the following systems

   Sun SPARC        SunOS x     MIT XR
   Sun SPARC        SunOS        MIT XR
   Encore Multimax  UMAX         MIT XR
   DEC      ULTRIX       MIT XR
   HP       HPUX       MIT XR
   MAC IIci         AUX         MIT XR
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing I have
only tested the Tcl and Xawd options on the first

A number of 'ifdef SYSV'isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one

Although aXe will probably build under R runtime problems have been
encountered in the past I have not bothered to try this version under
R and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems  Therefore if you are at R you very much take pot luck If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release
 of version  which should still be around It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library Wcl Not only
that it requires an old version of Wcl  or  Version  of
aXe was nearing completion when version  of Wcl came out so aXe 
never got converted to make use of it

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu 
and arjunanclacuk  initially and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites  Check your nearest using
xarchie

If you can't ftp try sending email to ftpmaildecwrldeccom with the
word help alone in your message body  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email

Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multicolored
iconsbuttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from
'resource' files Using pbmplus we can easily move tofrom Xpm to our other
environments of MSWindows and OS PM  We were wondering if Xpm or some
other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X
consortium for R as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by
X 

Along the same subject line is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used
because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes or is it
more involved just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there
for the 'original' format

Email replies preferred Thanks in advance

              Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists
              
   
   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful
   information on SCO Open Desktop since  through the ancestral USENET
   newsgroup scoopendesktop or it's companion mailing list  Similarly
   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum
   for SCO products in general
   
   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO
   newsgroups many current contributors including those who have been
   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt
   that the readership would be best served by creating a bizsco
   hierarchy to improve propagation and hence availability worldwide

   bizscoopendesktopgeneralannounce were newgrouped May   in
   accordance with accepted procedure within biz  Given the content
   this change relocated the opendesktop newsgroup to a more proper place
   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new announce
   and general groups  On Aug   the former scolistuunetuunet
   became scogen in keeping with established bizsco naming conventions

   bizscobinaries and bizscosources were newgrouped on June  
   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix UNIX and OpenDesktop specific
   binaries and source code  The binaries and sources news groups are
   moderated with moderator and submissions information and policy
   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups
   Respecting USENET etiquite these newsgroups are not gated to
   mailing lists but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts

   bizscomagazine was newgrouped Dec   to provide a discussion
   area for the readers writers and publishers of SCO Magazine
   
   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed
   you are now able to subscribe to the following
   
        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription

   You are strongly encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET
   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news
   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and
   I'll do my best to help  We also offer all required software in
   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP as do many archive sites
   If after having explored all options you are still unable to receive
   bizsco as news you may subscribe to the mailing lists
   
   The  discussion newsgroups are bidirectionally gated to companion
   mailing lists so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a
   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email
   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate
   mailing list subscription address above including in the message body

	Add subscriberaddress		eg
	Add yourlognamesitedomain  or
	Add upstreamyoursiteyourlogname

   Inclusion of an alternative working bangpath relative to a well know
   major functional site might prove beneficial  Deletions are handled
   the same way simply substitute Delete for Add ensuring that
   you use the exact same address you subscribed with  Mailing list
   subscribers receive how to post to the mlist article submission
   information when their request is processed  If you don't receive
   an acknowledgement within a few days check your routing and try a test
   message via xeniteconca back to your host  In such cases it's likely
   that someone somewhere is bouncing mail replies to you and would do
   the same with mailing list traffic and you'll want to resolve your
   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again  Mailing list
   subscriptions are free subject to whatever arrangements you may have
   with the sites feeding you
   
   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged
   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists this indicates that we
   are no longer able to find a working route to your site  We loose a
   handful of subscribers this way each month  If this happens to you
   please email us your known working bangpath relative to a major site

i want to do something like this

  date  xcb s   xcutsel

to get the output of the date command put into the XPRIMARY selection
unfortunately xcutsel is an interactive little bugger and there isn't a
command argument to tell it to just do it and not put up its little
window  so is there some other command that i CAN use like this  or
is there an analog to xcb that will put stuff in XPRIMARY instead of cut
buffer

I have the text on the nonUnx X servers so I do know that there are
X servers available for use with MSWindows   My question is does
anybody have any relevant information on the usability of these servers
Has anyone tried to use them on a Token Ring network and gotten them to
work

You may want to use a different locking style my mailbox is mounted over NFS

I also applied the following tweak to sbrmakedirc

 is it reliable

 how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over
the X protocol Does it just draw everything as graphics into
one window or does it use multiple windows and essentially work
more cleverly

 If I want to run MS Word for example remotely do I have to
run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely and then start MS
Word from that or can MS Word be started remotely on its own

	Thanks a lot

We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs

These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps
 use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data
  otherwise block new data comes quite often
 use msgop to check for messages and if true read them
  otherwise continue messages are user commands and not often
 update the display according to latest data and messages

We typically have several of these running in windows
plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag
Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run

Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into
O'Reilly Vol IV Ch  discusses adding a filewatcher and also
how to add workprocs that are run during idle time

We can 'openup' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc
The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate
Neither is letting the program freerun because others are hurt

The unix select call lets you block until any of several io are ready
We want that for the X main loop except not file io
Any suggestions or examples most welcome

We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems

     I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right

   who has called XtMoveWidget immediately checking the xy after the move

I have done this before but I'm not sure I used the best approach although
I tried several methods

You have to run up the window heirarchy using XQueryTree until you get
to the root window  Now this is not so simple because some window managers
slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window
so be sure to take that into account for further calculations

Calculate the position and widthheight offsets for each window using
XGetGeometry  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDERWIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION
Remember a windows borderwidth IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window so the
windows xywidthheight must be adjusted accordingly

All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the
windowmanager is using

Now to place the new window you have to use the same numbers to calculate 
where you want to place it because the windowmanager will reparent it on
the OUTSIDE of where you place your window if I remember correctly

DISCLAIMER All of this is from memory and I no longer have the code  But
I did get it working under several window managers correctly  Feel free to
call or email for further info

I have been using a HDS Xterminal and really like it What
is really powerful is that it can run the X server without
running a window manager One can then run a special client
X program called a window manager either  run 
motif or openlook from it's own firmware limiting the network
traffic  but having no HOME or  run motif or openlook
from some home place like a sparc or vms

This is powerful especially since I can exit one window manager
without killing windows and then start up another manager
Some of my VMS tools need special metamouse combos that work in
one manager and not the other

Well the question is

  On a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to
  break apart olwm from the olwmslave program Basically I
  want to run only the server and go somewhere else to run
  the window manager


Please respond my email as well as posting because of the
large volumes in windowX

Thanks

	Three q's

 is it reliable

I use it all day every day maintaining our ftp site and answering mail
via supportqdeckcom and I can honestly say that in the last few
months I've never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network
manager instability Of course I've crashed my machine quite a few times
on purpose during beta testing and that sort of thing but the tcpip
portion is quite stable

However keep in mind that DVX and the network managers are only going
to be as stable as the software they sit on top of so if your underlying
network kernel is flakey you can't expect DVX to be terribly stable

 how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over
the X protocol Does it just draw everything as graphics into
one window or does it use multiple windows and essentially work
more cleverly

It just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it To vastly
oversimplify what goes on we just take the windows graphics API calls
and translate them directly to Xprotocol unfortunately windows was
not really written to be networkaware so sometimes we see a speed
penalty when an app does something stupid like sending a big white bitmap
to erase something rather than just drawing a white box fortunately
that sort of thing is rare

 If I want to run MS Word for example remotely do I have to
run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely and then start MS
Word from that or can MS Word be started remotely on its own

You need to run MS windows which Word then runs inside You could run
multiple windows programs within the one WinX window and windows has
ways to automagically start winapps when you start windows so in practice
it's not really a major problem I have my system set up so that I can
run WinX which automatically starts Word Fullscreen for windows so
I never see any part of windows but word

the login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm

I always use the following in my tcshrc

I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing

I determined that my  x monitor was  dpi by measuring the

However this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely
After some research I believe this is caused by my applications
requesting fonts by Family Weight Slant and Pointsize  I believe
that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics
and displaying it  Since I have only dpi and dpi fonts on my
path the results are inaccurate  I do have some Speedo fonts but
not for the family I am using Helvetica

I think this is incorrect  The fonts should always be provided in the
resolution of the display  This never seems to happen unless you
explicitly request fonts by xres and yres  This is true of both the
scaleable and bitmapped fonts  For instance the command

xfd fn 'bitstreamcharter'

Will invoke a dpi font despite the fact that this is a Speedo font

The command  

xfd fn 'adobecourier'

Will invoke a dpi font or a dpi font depending on my font path
Despite the fact that X knows my display is  dpi and that it can
generate an dpi font for me  Unless I my applications specifies a
resolution X appears to pick a stupid default

Is this a bug  Is it a feature  If so why  Is there anything I can
do to get around this problem  People have suggested that I lie about
my resolution and specify a single font path  or  not both
This would at least make my app consistent but I like being able to
look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say Yup thats
an inch  Anyone have a set of dpi bitmapped fonts I can use

This results in a BadMatch error Can anyone please tell me why 



The colormap element of SetWinAttrib must be a legitimate TrueColor
colormap So use XCreateColormap with the proper visual and use it
in SetWinAttrib and don't forget the mask

And the inevitable caveat I usually use widgets setting the visual
and colormap resources rather than direct X routines so I could be
wrong But I think this is the general difficulty

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXetarZ on
exportlcsmitedu  and arjunanclacuk 

The significant change this time and the justification for the hike
in the major version number is

  o undo has been implemented

    By default only the last change can be undone but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many including unlimited
    levels of undo information should be kept Also undo of undo is
    supported

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe  

                          

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features amongst other things

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xtermlike keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences resources
   o both brief and comprehensive online help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xawd widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe ie without the Tcl and
Xawd options on the following systems

   Sun SPARC        SunOS x     MIT XR
   Sun SPARC        SunOS        MIT XR
   Encore Multimax  UMAX         MIT XR
   DEC      ULTRIX       MIT XR
   HP       HPUX       MIT XR
   MAC IIci         AUX         MIT XR
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing I have
only tested the Tcl and Xawd options on the first

A number of 'ifdef SYSV'isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one

Although aXe will probably build under R runtime problems have been
encountered in the past I have not bothered to try this version under
R and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems  Therefore if you are at R you very much take pot luck If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release
 of version  which should still be around It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library Wcl Not only
that it requires an old version of Wcl  or  Version  of
aXe was nearing completion when version  of Wcl came out so aXe 
never got converted to make use of it

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu 
and arjunanclacuk  initially and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites  Check your nearest using
xarchie

If you can't ftp try sending email to ftpmaildecwrldeccom with the
word help alone in your message body  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email

 Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me
 
 Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
 I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage
 is considerably slower factor of  on average than the
 Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
  the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
  XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what
 is the fastest way in XR to dump  plane image data to
 a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
 running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
 XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now
 
 All help appreciatedthanks
 
 Derek
 

The fastest way is to use an X server with shared memory extension It uses
shared memory if it is a local X server hence images don't have to be duplicated
and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension
is not available or if it's  not the localhost

Hi

I'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering
to an X display and then playing it back again  Rather than 
reinvent the wheel it like to find
	 a file format for saving X protocol
	 software that saves and replays such a session

Any ideas out there  I've heard that there is a version of Xscope
that will save and replay sessions

I'd be willing to share much of the code I develop back to the X community

Announcing xmgr ACEgr Motif version v

Xmgr is a fullfeatured XYplotting tool for UNIX workstations 
using X or OpenWindows There is an XView version called xvgr for
Suns Collectively these  tools are known as ACEgr Compiling 
xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version  and XR  xmgr will 
not compile under XRMotif x  XRMotif  should work 
fine but I've not been able to test this

For a summary of xmgr's capabilities get the file BLURB from
either site mentioned below

Available via anonymous ftp to either

ftpccalmrogieduCCALMRpubacegrxmgrtarZ

or

exportlcsmiteducontribacegrxmgrtarZ

Please remember to set the transfer type to binary

I am not able to Email xmgr but there are services provided 
by various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail You might try 
sending mail to ftpmaildecwrldeccom as follows

Subject hit return Bodyofletter help return quit

I've not tried this but it should give you instructions on how 
to use this service

 has been compiled and tested on

 IBM RS  AIX  XRMotif 
 DECstation  Ultrix a XRMotif 
 SGI Indigo  Irix  XRMotif 
 Sun SPARC   SunOS  XRMotif 
 HP       HPUX  XRMotif 

Compiling with gcc should be no problem but use settings 
appropriate for KR C

Of interest

In light of recent announcements COSE I'm suspending further 
development of the XView version For those without Motif on 
SUNs I'll provide a compiled binary eventually

I've begun rewriting ACEgr in C the initial target is
MSWindows

Improvementsfixes from  are

  The explicit placement of items in popups has been replaced
	with manager widgets The previous method led to problems
	on some servers all widgets in a popup would get scrunched
	into the upper left corner

  Many set operations can now be done in the FileStatus popup

  The PostScript driver should do a better job of producing
	EPSF'able output

A few things remain to do I could use some ideashelp on these

 Replace the Hershey fonts used for onscreen text with the
	xvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson
	The problem here is how to include support for this in the
	user interface

 Add support for Adobe Font Metrics I could use some PD or freely
	distributable routines for this

 Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver Presently
	the only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF into
	FrameMaker Need PS routines for pattern fills

 Add support for HDFNetCDF I'm interested in your opinion on
	how one would write a generic reader for these file formats

Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or
modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice I would
say that the shareware notice is unenforceable  All you need to do is
make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed
under the first part of the copyright notice  Of course this would be
circumventing the author's wishes on the subject but I'd say if you're
not going to pay him no matter what you'd be on relatively safe ground
with that approach  In fact given the internal contradictions of the
copyright notices I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being
a lawyer I can't be positive

Regardless the fees he's asking are not excessive and I would encourage
anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible  Even
though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the
author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing
else

 Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv We were using it mostly for slide
 shows because of its loop feature that display does not have display
 from the wonderful ImageMagick package D but I think I will implement
 it myself even a shellscript should do the job and forget xv

xli and xloadimage have a goto flag

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intelbased Unix with answers


I What options do I have for X software on my Intelbased Unix system

 Free options
	The BEST option is XFree which is an enhanced version of X 
	Any other version of X will have slower performance and will
	be more difficult to compile  Information on how to obtain XFree
	is listed below

	X is the port of the X server to System V that was
	done by Thomas Roell roellsgcscom
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards
	There are  major free versions X  is based on XR
	X  is included in MIT's XR distribution ie you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more
	X  is the current commercial offering from SGCS see below

II What is XFree and where do I get it

 What is XFree

   XFree is an enhanced version of X  which was distributed with
   XR  This release consists of many bug fixes speed improvements and
   other enhancements  Here are the highlights of the enhancements

     The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree
       selectable at runtime via the Xconfig file  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET based SVGA and others require a virtual screen width of
         The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default  With a highquality ET board VRAM this can yield
       up to  improvement of the xStones benchmark over X 
     The fX packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X b XR and approximately
        faster than X 
     Support for LOCALCONN compiletime selectable for server clients
       or both  This support is for both SVR and SVR  For SVR
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package' local connections from
       SCO XSightODT clients are supported
     Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGAC and TVGA SVGA chipsets
       Refer to the files READMEati and READMEtrident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers
     Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on exportlcsmitedu
     Type Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included and is
       compiletime selectable  There are contributed Type fonts in the
       contrib directory on exportlcsmitedu
     New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions
     Integrated support for BSD Mach and Linux
     A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree 
   they were not in XFree 

     The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bankswitching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to x 
       see the X manual page for more information
     Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server and with it the ability to support a two
       headed server  one VGA and one Hercules  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR it is also reported to work under Linux
     SVR shared libraries tested under ISC SVR  and 
     Support for SVR There are some special considerations to
       consider due to new USL bugs see the READMESVR file for
       more information
     Support for PS mice and Logitech MouseManTrackMan some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible
     A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data written by Eric Raymond derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation
     Greatly improved support for international keyboards including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers see the Xkeybd manual page for more 
       information
     The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
        MHz  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and reprobing using the new server
     Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive and more validation is done  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file see the X 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file

       Plus a number of other small things  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond and the
   current X mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat

 What OSs are supported

    XFree supports
	SVR Consensys V
	SVR Microport Dell Esix ISC ATT MST Consensys UHC
	SVR ISC    ATT 
	Linux Mach  BSD 

	BSD is not supported but it should work The most active
	BSD person is Greg Lehey groglemisde

	Note that Esix D and SCO are not supported yet
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches
	If you are interested in tackling this send mail to
	xfreephysicssuozau

 What video hardware is supported

   At this time XFree  supports the following SVGA chipsets

	Tseng ET
	Tseng ET
	Paradise PVGA
	Western Digital WDC WDC WDC these are supersets of
		the PVGA and use its driver
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGAC TVGA
	ATI  

	All of the above are supported in both  color and monochrome modes
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets which are only supported in
	 color mode

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards using k of
	video memory in a single bank and the Hercules card  On the
	ET only k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server and the GVGA has not been tested with more than k

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	nontraditional mechanisms for selecting pixelclock frequencies  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree
	 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered  Refer to the READMEclkprog file for information on how
	these programs work if you need to write one  If you do develop such
	a program the XFree team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree releases

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree
	it is suggested that you purchase an ETbased board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs  Avoid recent Diamond boards XFree will not
	work with them because Diamond won't provide programming details
	In fact the XFree project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products as long as such policies remain in effect  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted because of the potential liabilities
	If you would like to see this change tell Diamond about it

	Some people have asked if XFree would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards Theoretically the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree compatibility It
	could be ISA EISA or local bus  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card  Unfortunately the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines so this is largely an untested
	theory  However we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree
	working fine on them

 What about accelerated boards

	At this time there is no support in XFree for accelerated boards
	like the S ATI Ultra A TIGA etc  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink for SVR and SVR

	An S server is available for BSD and Linux  Contact
	hastynetcomcom for BSD or jonrobotsoxacuk for Linux

	A beta A server is available for Linux Contact martincsuncedu
	or jonrobotsoxacuk Note these servers are NOT part of XFree

 Why doesn't XFree support color VGA modes

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	color modes  In color modes each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains  pixel  But the color modes are implemented as bit
	planes  Each byte of frame buffer memory contains  bit from each
	of each of  pixels and there are four such planes  The MIT frame
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this  If VGA handled
	color modes by packing  bit pixels into each byte the MIT code
	could be modified to support this or it already may I'm not sure
	But for the VGA way of doing things a complete new framebuffer
	implementation is required  Some beta testers are looking into this
	but nothing is yet available from the project

 What other hardware or software requirements are there

	Obviously a supported SVGA board and OS are required  To run
	X efficiently MB of memory should be considered a minimum
	The various binary releases take MB of disk space depending
	on the OS eg whether or not it supports shared libraries
	To build from sources at least MB of free disk space will
	be required although MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound

 Where can I get source for XFree

	Source patches for the current version  based on XR PL
	from MIT are available via anonymous FTP from
		exportlcsmitedu under contribXFree
		ftpphysicssuozau under XFree
		ftpwintuenl under pubXFree
	For the rest of this FAQ these  location will be called FTP

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution

 Where can I get binaries for XFree

	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from
		ftpphysicssuozau		 SVR binaries
			under XFreeSVR
		ftpwintuenl			 SVR binaries
			under pubXFreeSVR
		ferkelucsbedu			 SVR binaries
			under pubSVRXFree
		stasibradleyedu		 SVR binaries
			under pubXFreeSVR
		blancmangemautexasedu	 SVR ISC binaries
			under pubISC
		ftpprztuberlinde             SVR ISC binaries
			under pubpciscXFree
		tsxmitedu			 Linux binaries
			under publinuxpackagesX
		agateberkeleyedu		 BSD binaries
			under pubBSDportsXFree
		ftpcsuwmedu			 Mach binaries
			under i

	Ensure that you are getting XFree   some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive and which compiletime option selections were
	made when building the distribution

IV What general things should I know about running XFree

 Installation directories

	The toplevel installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	usrX by default variable in configsitedef Binaries include
	files and libraries are installed in ProjectRootbinincludelib

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them This directory is
	nonstandard and was chosen this way to allow XFree to be installed
	alongside a commercialvendorsupplied X implementation

 Configuration files

	The XFree server reads a configuration file Xconfig on startup
	The search path contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage which should be consulted before asking questions

 Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat dwexmtgzfsattcom maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings
	The database is installed in usrXlibXetcmodeDBtxt and
	is in the source tree under mitserverddxxetc This database is
	also available from him for the latest copy and is kept on
	exportlcsmitedu in contribXmodeDBZ which is updated
	occasionally  Obtain a copy of this database  It just might have the
	settings you need  If you create new settings please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database

	If this doesn't help you the VideoModesdoc by Eric Raymond file 
	with XFree contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work and use
	this description to get them right  When you do send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database

	NOTE The old 'clockexe' program is not supported any more and
	      is completely unnecessary  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file if present and start the server  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file which is not necessary but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future

 Rebuildingreconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit

V What OSspecific things should I know about running XFree

	First of all the server must be installed suidroot mode 

 SVR
	Why won't my xterm run properly

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module you should define
	CONSEMno in you environment Otherwise xterm won't run
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch  is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap

 SVR

	Make sure you look at FTPREADMEISC if that's what you are running

 BSD

	Make sure you look at FTPREADMEBSD

	Also a separate BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	RichRiceedu  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFreeBSDFAQ at the following ftp sites

	    agateberkeleyedupubBSDportsXFree
	    wuarchivewustledumirrorsbsdportsXFree
	    graspunivlyonfrpubBSDportsXFree

 Linux

	You must be running Linux pl or greater and have the  gcc
	jump libraries installed

	Make sure the binaries X Xmono xload and xterm are setuid root

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in you'll have to
	run the server as X pn The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available If it is change the two files
	usrXbinstartx and usrXlibXxdmXservers removing the
	pn argument to X

	Make sure devconsole is either a link to devtty or has the major
	number  minor number  Also note that if devconsole is not
	owned by the user running X then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection Xdm will properly change the owner but
	startx won't

	When running xdm from rclocal you will need to provide it with
	a tty for example xdm  devconsole 

	For more detailed information please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsxmitedu

 Mach

	Make sure you look at FTPREADMEMach

VI What things should I know for building XFree from source

	This section has been removed from the FAQ since it is
	fully explained in FTPREADME and the OSspecific READMEs
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree

VII Is there anything special about building clients with XFree

 BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy etc
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsda
	which contains emulation for bcopy bzero bcmp ffs random
	seed A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	XXfuncsh in source files that call them  Xfuncsh provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions then you should link with libXbsda

 ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSIness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line  For example with stock MIT you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONSansi O fwritablestrings
	and to get rid of the ANSIness the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONSO fwritablestrings
	in his Imakefile  With this change you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONSansi
		CCOPTIONSO fwritablestrings
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is
		ANSICCOPTIONS
	to get rid of the ANSIness many X clients will die a horrible death
	with ansi  The effect is even more dramatic in practice because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONSANSICCOPTIONS' to a PassCDebugFlags definition

XFree Contact Information

    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree
    Core Team  At this time the Core Team consists of

	The original gang of four

Special Notes
     I have not updated this FAQ for the recentlyannounced OpenWindows 
      due to ship later this year
     Yes Sun is moving to Motif along with all of COSE  But the Motif to
      which they move will be a new Motif with some of the OPEN LOOK UI
      features added
     Yes OpenWindows  will use DPS instead of NeWS  NeWS is dead
      This means TNT is dead too
     XView and OLIT will be supported but probably not enhanced after the
      next release  I don't know if there will be a source release of
      XView  or not
     The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet
      ported to Motif  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool at least
     Yes the new Mailtool will be MIMEcompliant

Subject Terminology OPEN LOOK OpenWindows X XView OLIT MOOLIT Motif

 What is OPEN LOOK
    OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface GUI
    A GUI determines the look and feel' of a system  the shape of
    windows buttons and scrollbars how you resize things how you
    edit files etc

    The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified developed and maintained jointly by
    Sun Microsystems and ATT or USL

    See Also
	Bibliography

 What is OpenWindows
    OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK
    Graphical User Interface Specifications  It's compatible with the
    X window system from MIT as well as currently Sun's NeWS and SunView
    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems
    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release  from certain vendors
    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the
    program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively
    It should not be called Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or OpenLook' as
    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else
    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about  for the server
    plus about  for DeskSet and another  for ToolTalk
    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are

 What are OLIT XView and TNT
    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs
    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications  See the Bibliography
    for documentation on the individual toolkits  Here's a brief summary

    OLIT was ATT's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system
    it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were
    already XXt programmers to learn  You could buy the source from ATT
    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship  Sun includes the
    OLIT library in OpenWindows qv it is also often included in
    System V Release   It was written in C  The release of OLIT in
    OpenWindows  was OLIT   OLIT support passed to USL then a
    division of ATT now owned by Novell who replaced it with MoOLIT qv
    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing you will probably
    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or
    anything else that uses subclasses
    see the proceedings of the  X Technical Conference

    XView is Sun's toolkit for X written in C  XView is similar in
    programmer interface to SunView  There's even a shell script to help
    migrate source code from SunView to XView	 XView is often said to be
    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows
    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows and full source is
    available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu and elsewhere
    The current version of XView from Sun is 
    Despite rumours to the contrary  some even from within Sun  the
    XView toolkit is NOT about to be dropped by Sun  XView will be
    included in the next release of OpenWindows unlike NeWS
    On the other hand the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much
    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT

    The NeWS Toolkit TNT was an objectoriented programming system based
    on the PostScript language and NeWS  TNT implements many of the
    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of
    an application  It's currently included in OpenWindows

    The current version of TNT from Sun is  Release  contains some
    incompatibilities with tNt'  and TNT  but Sun are committed to
    supporting the API at least until they stop NeWS support some time
    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript  Wail
    You might ask what is committed to' means in this context the
    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing
    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT however

    The C User Interface Toolkit UIT consists of an objectoriented C
    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from
    DevGuide  GIL files  The UIT also includes features that simplify
    event management and the use of PostScript and color  It is said to be
    compatible with OpenWindows V and V and presumably V since the
    release mentions that it works on Solaris 
    UIT is not an official Sunsupported product but an ongoing project of
    various people within Sun  It can be found on exportlcsmitedu in
    the MIT contrib directory as UITVtarZ use binary mode

 Where does Motif fit in
    It doesn't   Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that
    is being developed by OSF	It has a look and feel' reminiscent of
    Microsoft Windows and the OS Presentation Manager  There are no non
    commercial Motif toolkits available although the Motif source is sold
    reasonably cheaply by OSF	Although Motif is currently available on
    more platforms than OpenWindows the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly
    used on many more machines simply because Sun and SysVR have such a
    large installed base
    Sun's CDWARE Volume  contains a roadmap for improving Motif
    applications by converting them to OLIT  there are also notes in
    the Periodic Table' OLIT demo OPENWINHOMEdemoolittable

 What is MoOLIT
    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from ATTUSL that lets users choose between
    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at runtime  It will be part of System V
    Release 
    Contact Joanne Newbauer jouslcom  

 What about that Display PostScript thing
    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X
    in the next release of OpenWindows  DPS is essentially a badly designed
    hack on top of a slow Level  PostScript interpreter intended to give a
    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously
    being harder to use as I understand it  The only real advantage it
    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller being generally less
    complete DPS is also available on more kinds of machine
    Performance on our RS is not suitable for interactive work
    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen
    Note that whereas XNeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems the DPS
    extension to X does not make Type  PostScript fonts available to
    ordinary X programs  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard
    there is at least one thirdparty version which does make fonts
    available however

Subject Window Managers  olwm olvwm

 What are olwm and olvwm
    They are window managers  A window manager is the part of the X Window
    system eg X that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows
    on the screen and for managing the user's interaction with the windows

    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager
    It's included with all of the OpenWindows qv implementations and
    you can also get the source by ftp since Sun donated it

    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop' hence the
    v' in its name  It shows a little map on the screen with the
    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle	 You can
    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys  This
    lets you run several clients applications and move the display around
    from one to the other  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows  olwm
    by Scott Oaks you need to have XView  to compile it
    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as exportlcsmitedu in the contrib
    directory there are three patches

 Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm
    Yes  If you use twm for example or mwm you won't be able to use
    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm and you probably won't see the
    footers some windows use to display certain messages

    If you use twm you'll want to use the fdelete function to unpin menus
    and get rid of programs that don't have a quit' button when not run
    under olwm
    For twm put this in your HOMEtwmrc
	LeftTitleButton target  fdelete
    where target is a x icon from usrincludeXbitmaps
    Alternatively try
	 Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm
	LeftTitleButton menu  fmenu OLmenu

	menu OLmenu 
	    Quit         fdelete
	

    For mwm you can doubleclick on the menu icon on the left of the title
    bar to dismiss a popup window I am told

    See the manual page for your window manager twm etc

Subject OpenWindows Terminals and Other Displays

 Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal
    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView NeWS PostScript and X
    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems
    Unfortunately it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS
    or SunView support and thus won't run on an X terminal  This includes
    pageview in particular

    You can use olwm or olvwm see above on an X terminal or a nonOpen
    Windows display and most OPEN LOOK clients eg OLIT or XView ones
    will work perfectly well  You may find that you get complaints about
    fonts not being found  If so see the Fonts section below
    If you are running the window manager builtin to an NCD terminal you
    may have problems with input focus setting Input True in the terminal's
    XDefault file in usrlibXxdm may or may not help


Subject Configuration Files Getting started with OpenWindows
     
 What configuration files do I need to know about

    xinitrc and xsessionrc

    The first time you run OpenWindows a xinitrc file will be created in
    your login directory HOME  If it already exists you might have to
    edit it somewhat it's simplest to move it and any other old X files
    you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files

    If your site uses xdm you should use xsession instead of xinitrc
    since xdm doesn't look at your xinitrc file

    openwininit openwinmenu and openwinsys

    These are optional files you can create in your HOME directory
    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use
    Look in OPENWINHOMElib normally usropenwinlib for these files
    without the leading  and copy any you want to change  You may need
    to edit your xinitrc to get them recognized  If you are not on an
    X terminal you will want to run a console window such as cmdtool C
    shelltool C xterm C or Chuck Musciano's contool program so that
    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen
    Note that openwinsys is not executed unless you edit xinitrc

    Xdefaults

    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here  In particular
    it is a good idea to include at least
	OpenWindowsFocusLenience	true
	Input TRUE
    These allow nonICCCMcompliant programs to receive input even if they
    forget to ask for it

    Props the program that runs when you select properties' from the default
    root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into Xdefaults
    Don't put comments in Xdefaults since props' deletes them

    startupps

    This is the NeWS user profile file read by OpenWindows actually xnews
    on startup	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual near the
    back  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change
    the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a
    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up
    at all or will get broken in strange ways	The NeWS manual gives code
    that is both incorrect and insufficient
    WARNING things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows  and 

    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your xinitrc with xset m see
    the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more information

    Here's what HOMEstartupps  should look like if you want a delay of
    about a third of a second  microseconds and a repeat rate of
    twenty or so keys per second  microseconds between repeats for
    OpenWindows   You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime
    is the delay between keys sent and thus doesn't include the time to
    process each key which is probably higher on my  than on your
    SuperSPARC  GTi injection   Again this is for OpenWindows 

	 don't want the demos  see p xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual
	 IncludeDemos false def

	UserProfile begin
	    KeyRepeatThresh   timeval storetimeval def
	    KeyRepeatTime   timeval storetimeval def
	     Note  and  differ greatly
	end

    You must also have a userps file in the same directory like this

	NeWS   findpackage beginpackage
	TNTCore   findpackage beginpackage
	TNT   findpackage beginpackage

	ClassRepeatKeys pop	 force repeatps to autoload

	endpackage endpackage endpackage

    If you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the
    OpenWindows server like this
	 psh i startupps
	Welcome to XNeWS Version
	 psh i
	Welcome to XNeWS Version
	classinit ClassRepeatKeys send
	 now press controlD

    You can also either of these two files startupps and userps to make
    the root window be retained so that a PostScript drawing on the
    background won't be erased when you move windows
	frambuffer Retained true put
    will do this  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used
    by the NeWS server xnews dramatically

 How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a lefthanded mouse and keyboard
    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one
    or two occasional surprises  See also man  xview for a list of
    keybindings you can change at least for XView programs

    With OpenWindows  you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings
    and then let SunView handle them  The status returned by svenv should
    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not put this
    in your xinitrc

    if eval svenv env
    then
	xmodmap e pointer    
	inputfromdefaults
    else
	xmodmap e pointer    
    fi


 How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle

    Run screenblank from etcrclocal if you can it's a boring but
    effective screen saver  See man screenblank'
    Under Solaris  you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system as
    it's not supplied  Then add a new file in etcrcd to make the system
    run screenblank automatically

Subject Key Bindings Cut and Paste

 How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs

    To go from XTerm to textedit say
     Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button
      in xterm
     Press COPY in the XTerm this key is L or Metac the O'Reilly
      XView manual gets this wrong
     Move to the textedit window and press PASTE L or Metav

    If this doesn't work see Trouble Shooting Cut and Paste

   To go the other way from textedit to XTerm
     Select the text in textedit  No need to use COPY
     Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST the middle mouse button
     You can also use the COPYCUT and PASTE buttons

 COPYPASTE is boring	 What shortcuts are available

    Quick Copy within textedit mailtool etc
     Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go
     Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE or CUT button
     Select the text you want to copymove  You'll see that it's underlined
      or crossed out as appropriate  In the jed demo it goes grey
     Let go of the PASTE or CUT button
     The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret

    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection
     Select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple
      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button
     Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection
     Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button and move the mouse
      pointer a little to the right you'll see the cursor changes to be the
      first  letters of the text or some other icon
     Still holding SELECT down move the mouse over the point where you want
      to drop the text
     You may see the mouse pointer change to a riflesight or target to show
      that it's OK to drop things here
     Let go of SELECT and the text is moved	This works in text fields of
      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows

    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection
     This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection except that
      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button

 What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere

    See the man page for textedit for some of them
    In general the editingmoving commands go in the opposite direction when
    shifted  eg Ctrlw deletes a word and CtrlW deletes the word to the
    right of the insert point

	Metai  include file	    Metaf  find selection forwardbackward

	Ctrla  start of line	    Ctrl  back word
	Ctrle  end of line	    Ctrl  forward word
	Ctrlw  delete word	    Ctrlu  delete to startEND of line
	CtrlReturn  move to endSTART of document

    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default
    keys see also the olwm or olvwm manual page

 What can I put in my ttysrc	 Where is it documented

    See the manual page for shelltool

Subject Applications Finding Out
    Contact SunSoft or Sun and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide
    which lists over  pages of applications and also the huge
    Catalyst listing of products for Suns updated sixmonthly

    Sun's free CDWare CDROMs each contain demo versions of several popular
    OPEN LOOK applications  Often you can simply contact the vendor
    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo and receive the full
    product documentation

    SunPICS produces a CDROM for NeWSPrint users Printer's Pallate which
    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters as
    well as  scaleable fonts that you can license

    There is a separate FAQ posting in compwindowsopenlook that lists
    a number of free and commercial aplications mail leesqcom for a
    copy including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a

Subject DeskSet Mailtool Calendar Manager etc

 Is there a ttybased interface to cm Calendar Manager
    Yes cmdelete cminsert and cmlookup these all have manual pages
    If man cmdelete doesn't work or gives strange messages see under
    Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages below

 How can I arrange to have my signature included in my outgoing mail
    The best way is
     cd
     cp usrlibtextswrc 
     chmod w textswrc
    edit textswrc use vi textedit or whatever you prefer
    add the follwing
	KEYRIGHT    FILTER
	cat signature
    you might need to change  to HOME

    Now pressing R will insert your signature file



Subject Fonts

 Does OpenWindows support Type  PostScript fonts
    Yes under either Solaris  or  I'm not sure which
    Or Not Yet in other words

    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them I'm told
    The  fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted though and
    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is
    interesting  The F font format is described in a publication from the
    Sun OpenFonts group listed in the Bibliography below  Documentation on
    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts

    You can buy F fonts from SunPICS Monotype Linotype URW and probably
    other major foundries

    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type  fonts

 Improving font rendering time
    Although the Sun type renderer TypeScaler is pretty fast it's not as
    fast as loading a bitmap   You can pregenerate bitmap fonts for sizes
    that you use a lot and you can also alter and access the font cache
    parameters	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the
    font cache size
	 psh i
	Welcome to XNeWS Version  psh will say this at you
	currentfontmem 	 type this line 
		 and here's whai my server was using   Kbytes
	 setfontmem
	 Just to check
	currentfontmem 
	
    See pp ff of the NeWS  Programmer's Guide  You need to say psh i
    so that the PostScript packages are loaded  see the psh man page

 Making bitmap fonts for faster startup
	 mkdir HOMEmyfonts
	 cd HOMEmyfonts
	 makeafb  M OPENWINHOMElibfontsBembofb
	Creating Bemboafb
	 convertfont b Bemboafb
	BemboafbBembofb

	 bldfamily
	 Bembo		       Bemboff Encoding latin
	cat Compatlist No such file or directory
	 xset fp pwd
	 xset fp rehash

    If you want the server to see your new font directory every time
    add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one
    of your startup files eg login or profile

 Converting between font formats convertfont etc
    You can also use Folio fonts with an X server by converting them to a
    bitmap X bdf format first  Your licence forbids you from using the
    fonts on another machine and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't
    use them for printing  Having said all that  you can use makeafb and
    convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or
    bdftopcf

    Use mftobdf from the SeeTeX distribution to convert TeX pk fonts to
    X bdf format which you can then use with either X or OenWindows

    You can also use der Mouse's getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running
    X display server  ftp larrymcrcimmcgilledu  Xgetbdf

 XviewOLIT fonts at  dpi
    There aren't any  More precisely the various text fonts such as
    Lucida Typewriter Sans are available at  dpi and in fact are
    scalable under OpenWindows	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps and don't
    scale very well

Subject Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages

	assert nodefinitions
    to CFLAGS in your Makefile or even in Imaketmpl


Subject Trouble Shooting It Won't Let Me Type

 When I try to type into some programs I just get beeps or nothing happens
    It is a good idea to include at least
	OpenWindowsFocusLenience	true
	Input TRUE
    in your Xdefaults file as these allow nonICCCMcompliant programs to
    receive input even if they forget to ask for it
    See the next item for editing Xdefaults

Subject Trouble Shooting Cut and Paste not working

 I can't paste from xterm to XView including Sun DeskSet programs
    Under OpenWindows  you need to add the following either to your
    HOMEXdefaults file or to OPENWINHOMElibappdefaultsXTerm instead

	XTermVTTranslations override 
		KeyLselectsetCLIPBOARDn
		KeyLinsertselectionCLIPBOARD
  
    You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing
    L the Paste key

    Under OpenWindows  this is already in the appdefaults file so if it
    isn't working check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to
	usropenwinlibTNS
    and if it isn't either set it or copymerge the above lines from
    OPENWINHOMElibappdefaultsXTerm into usrlibXappdefaultsXTerm
    See also Environment Variables

    This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard
	XTermVTtranslations overriden
	    Ctrl MetaBtnUp insertselectionPRIMARYCUTBUFFERn
	    Ctrl MetaBtnUp selectendPRIMARYCUTBUFFERCLIPBOARDn
	    KeyPressL insertselectionCLIPBOARD
    Note be sure that the n is at the very end of the line there must
     be no following spaces and any  or  signs showing that this FAQ file
     was altered must also be removed

    If you are using XR you may find that adding the lines
KeyL startextend selectendPRIMARY CLIPBOARD CUTBUFFERn
       KeyReleaseL killselection n
    before the KeyPressL line will make L CUT work as a cut key

    If you alter HOMEXdefaults instead you must use what X calls a
    more specific' resource name
	xtermvttranslations
    will do

 I can't paste from XView including Sun DeskSet programs to xterm

    If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard you can
    use Metax Metac and Metav for cut coy and paste respectively
    You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to
    your Xdefaults file edited as you wish the values shown here are the
    defaults

	OpenwindowsKeyboardCommandCopy cMetaL
	OpenWindowsKeyboardCommandPaste vMetaL
    
    Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview and also in the
    thinnish blue book Companion to Volume  XView Reference Manual' from
    O'Reilly and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages

 I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE L Metav
    Remove the file tmptextswshelf and see if that helps see also the
    next item

 Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all OpenWindows only
    Oh dear  Use ps xuaww  grep xv  to check that svxvselsvc is running
    and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started
    OpenWindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm
    If not start it  If it dies check that there is no tmpsvxvselsvc
    before restarting it  you may need to be root to remove it or you can
    reboot your workstation
    Check that there is space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there
    are a lot of files there with names like tmpttytxta if there are
    several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out

    Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start
    a terminal emulator and remove and tmpttytxt and tmpText files
    that are still there  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again
    after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working
    again you can just carry on  Note that files in tmp not owned by you
    might be in use by another worker comrade so don't remove those without
    checking first

Subject Trouble Shooting Not authorized to use display

    If you get error messages that look like
	Xlib  connection to  refused by server
	Xlib  Internal error during connection authorization check
	Error Can't Open display
    try on the machine running OpenWindows or X
	xhost machine
    where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that failed
    If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you
    using your display you will have to type the bizarrelooking
	xhost hostname
    or xhost happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation
    This lets ANY user on happyboy' access your display

    With OpenWindows  you can also use xauth and the Programmer's Guide 
    describes how to do this in Chapter  p   This is more secure
    Also check the man page for fbtab to stop other users accessing the
    framebuffer directly

    Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows  under SunOS 
    to fix a serious security problem  It is available through your local
    Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftpuunet
     system in sundist
    Fix                     PatchID        Filename            Checksum
    loadmodule                      tarZ       


    On an X Terminal there may be a setup menu that lets you change or
    disable the list of hosts that can access the display

    If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight
    there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in tmp
    that are used to communicate with the server when DISPLAY doesn't have
    a hostname before the  or is empty  Have the system administrator
    change the cron script to skip sockets

Subject Trouble Shooting other common problems

 I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away Sun  or 
    If refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later
	you need to run xterm C from your xinitrc or start one up in
	the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the
	WorkspaceUtilities menu  Better still pick up contool and run
	that  Get it from exportlcsmitedu in the contrib directory  It
	will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a
	message appears it's very easy to configure

    If refresh from the WorkspaceUtilities menu doesn't make the messages
    go away
	a Sun with a cg frame buffer has two screens  you can move the
	mouse off the righthand by default edge of the screen and onto
	a whole new but monochrome display called   See the man
	page for openwin I have a shell script that checks for this and
	if there's a devcgfour does
		openwin dev devcgfour dev devbwtwo
	If you are running X or OpenWindows  you might need to add this
	to your xinitrc or other startup file
	
	    eval svenv display unix env
	    olvwm display unix
	 
	Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically
	You can also run switcher e  to get rid of the messages  Also see
	the note about contool above

 Is there an easy way of editing Xdefaults
    Use props' which appears in the default root menu as properties'
    This starts props' a property editor which will rewrite your
    Xdefaults after removing comments  It then applies any changes
    Keep comments by using comment instead of  for example
	commentfont PalatinoItalic

 How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit
    set the default editor to
	sh c exec emacs font lucidasanstypewriter FILE
    you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one

 How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video
    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 	 With OpwnWindows 
    there are various ways including using bg and fg options  If you're
    using OpenWindows  on a Sun   probably the best you can do short of
    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC is to use xterm instead of cmdtool

 Why don't flat checkboxes work
    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these
    A workaround is to edit the Guide output as it's only Guide's output
    that's broken not the actual checkbox code
    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide   If you're
    still using an ancient DevGuide you should upgrade as soon as possible
    the new one is fantastic

 When I leave OpenWindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays
  on the screen
    Try running clearcolormap if this helps put it as the last line in
    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows eg openwin'

 When I use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something
    This was a bug related to some systems only  The only workround was to
    use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv  or xgrabsc
    
 Why have some of my function keys stopped working
    Keys F and F changed from SunF and SunF to SunXKF and SunXKF
    respectively in OpenWindows   Applications must be recompiled or you
    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to
    change your keyboard layout back again

 When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit I get the Sunview version
    See under Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages below

    see also next item

 Mixing X and OpenWindows
    see also next item

    Note that OpenWindows  includes the XR core distribution to patch
    level  but not the contrib directory  These notes apply to
    OpenWindows  although you could also the do same sort of thing with
    OpenWindows  and XR

    Install the X libraries in usrlibX	You can intermix OpenWindows
    and XR or XR they're all compatible in this respect
    Put the X binaries in for example usrbinX

    Put usrbinX last in your PATH so that you get OpenWindows versions
    of programs instead of X ones where appropriate although this is a
    matter of preference  In any event put the OpenWindows bin directory
    first  see the preceding item for more details on that  If you have
    bin or usrbin they're the same directory on SunOS earlier in
    your PATH than OPENWINHOMEbinxview you'll get SunView programs instead
    of OpenWindows ones

    Set LDLIBRARYPATH so that usropenwinlib is last after the X
    library directory	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows  but with
    older versions you'll get error messages from X programs if you don't
    do this  The messages are generally harmless see next item although
    xdm core dumps if this isn't right

    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't
    usropenwin

    See Also
	Environment Variables especially XFILESEARCHPATH

 I get error messages on my screen about ldso libXso not found
    set LDLIBRARYPATH to be usropenwin  If you also use X use
	     usrlibusrlibusropenwinlib
    If you put this in a shell script or your profile use
    OPENWINHOMEusropenwinlib instead of usropenwin this is for
    binsh for csh it is different

 I launch my filemgr and I get ldsomap heap error  at devzero
    Your system needs to be patched  Look in OPENWINHOMElibOSpatches
    and install the patch

 Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me
    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook	It won't run under
    X on an X terminal or on anything else because it uses NeWS to draw
    the PostScript text and pictures
    If you are using OpenWindows  you need to use the OpenWindows 
    compatible navigator it's called navigatorow on the AnswerBook CDROM
    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows  you can replace
    navigator wih navigatorow altogether rename the old one first to
    satisfy your sense of paranoia
    The navigatorow binary is also on CDWare Vol 
    Note that the data files are in PostScript so you can look at them with
    a PostSript viewer qv

 Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb
    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from
    ftpengauburnedu  as pubrealxfishdbZ

 Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu
    It isn't implemented yet  Many programs do respond to the Properties
    Key L though or have a popup menu with Properties on it

 File completion in the Cshell is broken in cmdtool
    Sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine  It also
    works if you run command tool on a remote machine
    Fixed in OpenWindows  shipped with Solaris 

 When I run OLIT programs some of the widgets are red
    Release  of OLIT added mouseless operation action widgets can be
    selected via the keyboard  The currently selected item is highlighted
    in red the Red Stain' to show that it has the input focus
    To disable it in most places add this to your HOMEXdefaults file
	traversalOn off
	TextEdittraversalOn on
	TextFieldtraversalOn on
    You can change the color using for example
	InputFocusColor grey
	inputFocusColor green
	ListinputFocusColor your background color
    See the man page resourcesw at the start of the OLIT  Widget Set
    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows  programmer documentation
    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id  the
    OLIT CTE Jumbo Patch

 When I run several programs the colors on the screen all change when
  I move into a different window colormap flashing
    
    This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time
    However you can minimise the effect with the following procedure
      Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve
      Run
	cmapcompact save
       to create the owcolors file
      Put the line
	cmapcompact init
       near the start of your startup file xinitrc
      Exit and then restart the window system
      cmapcompact init will push those colors owcolors to the end of
	the colormap and reserves them

    Also note that controlL locks the colors of the current window and
    ControlL unlocks them  this is described in the olwm manual page

 pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash see above
    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif
    window manager mwm with OpenWindows
    Try running pageview like this
	OPENWINHOMEbinreservecolors svmono
	OPENWINHOMEbinpageview
	OPENWINHOMEbinreservecolors discard

 XDM breaks things
    Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix controlling terminal'
    Use etcsetsid to start your command tools and all will be well
    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv as in
	svenv exec usrbintraffic
    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables
    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root which is a security
    hole for OpenWindows use the OpenWindows  xdm or be aware that your
    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root

 Function keys  and  stopped working
    In OpenWindows  the X names keysyms for these keys was changed
    to SunXKF and SunXKF	 Code which uses them should be recompiled
    or you might be able to get away with
	xmodmap e 'keysym SunXKF  SunF'

Subject Trouble Shooting XView problems
    This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears which has been
    promised but hasn't reached here	Note that there is also a usenet
    newsgroup alttoolkitsxview although it doesn't sem to have very
    wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles
    per month	You should also look at the FAQ in compwindowsx

 how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items
    PANELLISTFONT takes an int rownumber and an Xvopaque fonthandle
    PANELLISTFONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xvopaque fonthandles
    There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font
    You have to make sure that you always specify PANELLISTFONT when you
    insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function
    insertrowlist row string that hides the nasty bits

 how do I keep an XView popup window displayed after a button is pressed
    In the button callback do
        xvsetbutton PANELNOTIFYSTATUS XVERROR NULL
    This will keep the window visible
    You might also need to investigate the MENUNOTIFYSTATUS attribute

 how do I make an XView button look pressed
    call panelbeginpreview and panelcancelpreview these are
    documented in  er  the XView  source

 OpenWindows  imake doesn't work properly

Subject Environment Variables

    Environment variables and plausible values to use  this list doesn't
    take into account any local changes that you might have made of course
    This list is for OpenWindows   differences for OpenWindows  are
    marked and I've added some comments for users of XR and XR too

    DISPLAY  The name of the X Windows Display to use
	 on the local machine the one actually running X or xnews
	 on some machines for a second monochrome screen
	machinerunningunix on other machines
	You may need to do xhost othermachine to let programs on other
	machines use your display see also under Trouble Shooting and see
	the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version  Programmer's Guide
	pp ff
	See also console messages under Trouble Shooting
    FONTPATH  Where xnews searches for fonts
	usropenwinlibfonts
	you can also use xset fp dir to add a directory to the font path
	but you may have to do xset fp rehash afterwards  This is fine
	under OpenWindows but many X servers have font problems
    HELPPATH  Where XView looks when you press the Help key or F
	usropenwinliblocaleusropenwinlibhelp
	On SunOS  or with OpenWindows  omit the first entry which
	is for sites using a local other than C or USA
    LDLIBRARYPATH   Where to look to find shared C libraries
	usrlibusrlibusropenwinlibusrCCarch
	the usrCCarchlib entry is only needed if you use C programs
    OPENWINHOME	 Where OpenWindows lives
	usropenwin  
    KEYBOARD MOUSE  serial devices to use instead of the console
	don't set these for normal use devkbd and devmouse
    PATH  Where the Shell searches for programs to run
	OPENWINHOMEbinOPENWINHOMEbinxviewusrlocalbin
	HOMEbinarchusrucbusrbinusrbinXusrhosts
	you will certainly want to change this example  There is no
	OPENWINHOMEbinxview in OpenWindows 
    XFILESEARCHPATH  Where programs look for appdefaults files
	usropenwinlibTNS
        This is set automatically by openwin in OpenWindows 
        You might want to use usrlibXTNS or perhaps both
        separated with a  for example for sh users
            XFILESEARCHPATHOPENWINHOMElibTNSusrlibXTNS
	    export XFILESEARCHPATH
	If you use XR you might instead want
	    usrlibXLTNCS
	    usrlibXlTNCS
	    usrlibXTNCS
	    usrlibXLTNS
	    usrlibXlTNS
	    usrlibXTNS
	    OPENWINHOMElibTNS
	put all this on one line though with no spaces

	Together with the following in libXinitrc
	xrdb merge 'ENDXRDB'
	   customization
	ENDXRDB

	xrdb merge 'ENDXRDB'
	ifdef COLOR
	   customization  color
	endif
	ENDXRDB

	you automatically get a color oclock editres bitmap xcalc and
	xlogo since they use the customization resource appearing as C in
	the XFILESEARCHPATH see oclock n
	according to Rainer Sinkwitz sinkwitzifiunizhch


Subject Where Can I get It Ftp implementations etc

    XView  is available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu and
    elsewhere

    MoOLIT can be bought from ATT in source form

    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun or you can get the source from
    Interactive Systems Inc  It is also included in some vendors' System V
    Release  implementations although that's not always the latest version
    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures
    is  for the Sun  series it is frozen at OpenWindows 
    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS and it is also included as
    the windowing system for Solaris

    There are said by Sun to be over  ports of OpenWindows either
    available now or in progress  Unfortunately none of them seem to
    be available from anywhere  Contact anthonyovicom for more information

    There's at least one book on using Solaris ie SunOS

    Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows
    although you may have to order it separately  Here's what I have they
    are each a little over  cm square wider than A paper and vary from
    about  cm to about cm thick  They say User's Guide' or Programmer's

    There might be documentation about the Link Manager somewhere too

    ATT includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT

    Sun's AnswerBook CDROM contains a lot of the above documentation
    including some of the O'Reilly books not the XView  Volume  though

    Volume  of the O'Reilly series is about X Administration and mentions
    OpenWindows although it is primarily aimed at XR

Description
    namefinder was orginally designed as a replacement for the name finder
    missing from the OpenWindows Version  mailtool  It has since grown
    into a tool for several electronic mail related activities including
    interaction with local ListServ robots for handling mail lists
    requesting FullName style mail aliases from your local PostMaster and
    providing mailbox status information ala finger

    namefinder is written in C cfront  using gxv version 
    If you don't have access to a C compiler a precompiled sparc
    executable is included in the distribution

In general there is no point in using XView  if you have XView  available
it's a good idea to look for an XView  port first  Moving from XView  to

dirty tricks or used undocumented calls

	HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF X  monthly posting
                                   
	    Compiled by Art Mulder artcsualbertaca

  More RAM Faster CPU's More disk space Faster Ethernet  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation

  Well more hardware isn't always an option and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity

  This FAQ list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE

  Performance is a highly subjective issue  The individual user must
  balance speed' versus features' in order to come to a personal
  decision  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts

  This document is specifically concerned with X  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation
  However they are outside the scope of this document

     People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    System Performance Tuning by Mike Loukides  IMHO it contains a
    wellwritten comprehensive treatment of system performance  I'm
    unaware of any other similar books  ed

What about the Other X FAQ


  David B Lewis faqcraftuunetuunet maintains the informative and
  well written compwindowsx Frequently Asked Questions document
  Its focus is on general X information while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance

  The compwindowsx FAQ does address the issue of speed but only with
  regards to the X server  The gist of that topic seems to be
	Use XR it is faster than R
  Please see the X FAQ for complete details


Window Managers


  There are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different
  features and abilities  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features  At this
  point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger
  is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move
  Also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows                           Joe English joetrysteroartcom

  I've found that a good font for tiling is x aka
  miscfixedmediumrnormalciso  It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun x screen
  and still get two  column terminal windows sidebyside on the
  display with no overlap  Other font suggestions will be accepted


The X Server


Which Server
      
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware
  If you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome X server

  On my Monochrome Sun I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun colour server and XsunMono however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging  
          thanks to Jonny Farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk
                        Michael Salmon MichaelSalmoneosericssonse 

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference  Jeff Law
  lawschirfcsutahedu advises us that on a Sun system X should be
  compiled with gcc version  or with the unbundled Sun compiler
  You can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other highquality commercial
  compilers on the market

Locking the Server into RAM
              
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged  eg via a call to plock  Does this help
  performance at all  I've had one inquiry on this topic and a few
  pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it  I am not in a position to give it a try

Starting your Server
          
  Joe English joetrysteroartcom 
    If you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one  After I changed my
    xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core though

  This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works  

  Warner Losh impSolbourneCOM provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works which I have summarized here

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts  This process touches a large number of
    pages  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory  If you
    put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up

    Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources
    being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so
    forth  All this activity is typically memory intensive  Once this
    initialization is done The process has reached a steady state
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    Xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there
  are so many variables to be considered available RAM local swap
  space load average number of users on your system which clients
  you are starting etc

  Currently in my xinitrc I have a situation like
	sleep  exec xclock  
	sleep  exec xbiff  
	sleep  exec xterm  
	sleep  exec xterm  

  I've experimented with
	sleep  exec xclock  
	sleep  exec xbiff  
	sleep  exec xterm  
	sleep  exec xterm  

  I've even tried
	sleep  exec startXclientsscript  
  and then in startXclientsscript I had
	sleep  exec xclock  
	sleep  exec xbiff  
	sleep  exec xterm  
	sleep  exec xterm  

     The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down
    into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched 

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with
  my current setup for its simplicity  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you

Fonts
  
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use you'll get speed increases in loadup time

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one
  large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients  or
  at least all your heavily used clients  to use only those few fonts
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server  This will also conserve server resources since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server
			       Farrell McKay fbmptcburpptcbuozau
			        Joe English joetrysteroartcom 

  eg My main xterm font is x so I also have twm set up to use x
  in all it's menus and icons etc  Twm's default font is x  Since
  I don't normally use x I've eliminated one font from my server

  Oliver Jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom
    Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs
    If you will make extensive use of R scalable fonts use a font server

About the Resources File
            

    Keep your Xresources  Xdefaults file small  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time          Joe English joetrysteroartcom

  One suggestion

    In your Xdefaults Xresources file try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications  For example  reverseVideo true

    Then separate your resources into individual clientspecific
    resource files  For example HOMElibappdefaults  In your
    login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH HOMElibappdefaultsN

     The compwindowsx Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work
    ed

    So when xterm launches it loads its resources from
    appdefaultsXTerm  Xdvi finds them in appdefaultsXDvi
    and so on and so forth  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resourcefile naming pattern  You can check in your system
    appdefaults directory often usrXRlibXappdefaults to
    find the proper name and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification pg   
		    Thanks to Kevin Samborn sambornmtkgccom

		             and Mike Long mikeleecornelledu
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits

     Easier to maintain  more usable

     Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCEMANAGER
      property  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker since it doesnt have to load all your resources

     Applications only process their own resources never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them

  It also has drawbacks

     the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database you just need to rerun the
      application without having to xrdb again

     xrdb will by default run your Xdefaults file through cpp  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs they will not
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS

      I had C style comments in my Xdefaults file which cpp stripped
      out  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources  Xt did NOT
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted
      processing the resource file

      The loss of preprocessing which can be very handy eg ifdef
      COLOR''  is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management

     You may also run into some clients which break the rules  For
      example neither Emacs  nor Xvt  will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in Xdefaults

     when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored your client
      will not find its resources  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources            Casey Leedom caseygaussllnlgov

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have and am planning on trying
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my
  Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for
  clients that I seldom use

Define Your Display Properly
              

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server  In
  that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  hostname where hostname is the name of your workstation you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to unix or   By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests
			thanks to Patrick J Horgan pjhrasamdahlcom

  See the DISPLAY NAMES section of the X man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name

  I don't think it's stock MIT but at least Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially
			      Rob Sartin opensisartinuunetUUNET

  Jody Goldberg jodyalgorithmicscom sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  nonMIT patches and so have elected not to include it here  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor  lines patch themselves  In the meantime if
  you want to try it yourself email Jody  ed


Clients


  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running  Think also
  about the kind of programs you are running  For example  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock

  Unfortunately I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word

   Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  eg Xclock Xterm Xbiff are welcome  ed

  I've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject
  of X client programs  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries  In
  this case using a nonXt for example client program may actually
  increase the amount of RAM consumed

  The upshot of all this seems to be Don't mix toolkits  That is try
  and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients or just Motif
  clients etc  If you use more than one then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library

  Know your environment and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment

A Better Clock for X
          

 xcuckoo
   suggested by Duncan Sinclair sinclairdcsglaacuk
   available on exportlcsmitedu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of another program
   Saves screen real estate

 mclock
   suggested by der Mouse mouseLightningMcRCIMMcGillEDU
   available larrymcrcimmcgilledu  in Xmclockshar

   Non Xtbased  Extensively configurable  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources

  Of course the ultimate clock  one that consumes no resources and 
  takes up no screen real estate  is the one that hangs on your wall
   

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
                

  From the README file distributed with xterm

  
  		 Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here
  
   This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution
   
  

  Ugly maybe but at my site it's still the most used  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites
  Laziness  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available  See below

  If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage   Oliver Jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom

 Xvt
   suggested by Richard Hesketh rlhukcacuk 
   available exportlcsmitedu in contribxvttarZ

   if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get
   hold of xvt   it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog 

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm  You don't have to
   rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm  In it's current
   version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature but I've not found any
   yet

   UPDATE March   I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin brianwarkentineengsuncom regarding xvt  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm  For
   instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling
   speed try this quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap
   bs and see which program can scroll faster  Also while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements We don't have any hard
   numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major

   As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it
   made little difference since if you never use it it never gets
   brought into memory

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm  In summary  Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary
   If you can provide some hard data I'd like to see it
   Specifically How much RAM each occupies how much swap each needs
   relative speed of each

 mterm
   suggested by der Mouse mouseLightningMcRCIMMcGillEDU
   available larrymcrcimmcgilledu  in
     Xmtermsrcmtermballowax

   I also have my own terminal emulator  Its major lack is
   scrollback but some people like it anyway


Tuning your client
         

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster

  From Scott Barman scottasdcom comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes
    particularly the initial one in the field  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is nonzero and the focus is on a text field widget
    or even just a text widget the Ibeam cursor will blink
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the
    widget code is making a request to the server CopyArea  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to   It is not
    noticeable on a MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference
    on a slower system

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas  Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests


Miscellaneous Suggestions


Pretty Pictures
       
  Don't use large bitmaps GIF's etc as root window backgrounds

   The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc

   These take up RAM and CPU power  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a mb Sun  running xphoon as their root window

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation

   If you're anything like me you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway

A Quicker Mouse
       
  Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse  I use xset m   in my xinitrc file
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist  See the xset man page for further ideas and information

  Hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for
  fine work  To cover my options I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager  

  eg for twm 
      menu mouse settings 
        Mouse Settings			ftitle
	  Very Fast				 xset m   
	  Normal Fast			 xset m   
	  System Default UnAccelerated	 xset m default 
	  Glacial				 xset m   
      

Programming Thoughts
          
  Joe English joetrysteroartcom 
    To speed up applications that you're developing there are tons of
    things you can do  Some that stick out

     For Motif programs don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons labels lists et al use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highestlevel manager
      widget  Again stick to as few fonts as possible

     Better yet don't use Motif at all  It's an absolute pig

     Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly  Try to reuse them
      This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too

     Use a line width of  in GCs  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference

     Compress and collapse multiple Expose events  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one

  Francois Staes franskiwiuiaacbe 
    Just a small remark I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc but I didn't find the time yet I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable  somewhat  times faster

   Any confirmation on this from anyone  ed

  Andre' Beck AndreBeckIRSInfTUDresdende 

   Unnecessary NoExpose Events

    Most people use XCopyAreaXCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but
    they forget to reset graphicsexposures in the GC used for the
    blits This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most
    cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's eventloop again and again

   Thousands of XChangeGC requests

    This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded XApps
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection by moving it toward the client startup phase

Say What
      
  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first

  David B Lewis by day dblosforg by night davidcraftuunetuunet 
    How about this swap displays with someone else Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display Goal reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received
  the following confirmation

  Michael Salmon MichaelSalmoneosericssonse
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS with only  MB it was
    essential when I only had  MB

  Casey Leedom caseygaussllnlgov 
    The X Server and the client are competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine  Not really a
    major problem except that the X client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing

  Timothy H Panton thpwesthawkuucp 
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle X's
    cpu usage is bursty  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpuintensive at the same time is small If they
    are not then you get twice the cpumemory available for your
    action

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 
    cpu's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network typically k vs k for a pipe allowing
    even fewer context switches

Yes but it's broken on OW   It does not handle multiple pages

Im new to Xlib programming Im having a problem I hope someone here can
help me with I create a window and I want it to have some background color
say red and draw an oval in it Further when I resize the window I want
to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window whether it
is larger or smaller Im using AIXwindows on an RS

My problem is this when I resize the window only the original part of the
window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into Everything else
is a greythe oval tries to redraw itself but gets clipped I can see that
it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it but it only shows up in
the region that was the original size of the window when created

For example I start out the window at x in width and height If I
resize it to x the only part that has any color drawn into it is
is from the origin out to xthe rest is grey Further the oval
only shows up in that x area

What am I doing wrong How can I get a window to resize and redraw a 
rescaled image in it to take up the full size of the window

Second question
Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are

Thanks
Chris

I have used it to do realtime data display and analysis as well as

	How do you handling scaling of X text while performing zooming 
operations  on figures Is restricting user to select scalable fonts too 
restrictive and  a absolute NO NO
Any books that have discussion on this topic  Should have really taken more 
of those Computer Graphics courses but now its too late  

	I will summarize response
Thanks in advance

 Does anyone know if the following is possible and if so how do I go about
 doing it
 
 I want to be able to display remote X applications on a VAXstation  off
 of an Internet node Here is where the problem comes up the VAXstation isn't
 connected directly to the Internet but is connected via Decnet to a node that
 does have a connection to the Internet Does anyone know if it is possible to
 get the display to use TCPIP from the remote Internet node down to my local
 Internet node and then send it via Decnet down to the VAXstation 


For the machine that is connected to the InterNet what is it running  If it
is running VMS then if you obtain MultiNet for it MultiNet comes with a
TCPIP to DECnet gateway for X

Hi All
       This is the first time I've posted to the net so I hope this is
going to the right people
  I'm looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that
allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC 
  The idea is to use the PC as a cheap X windows terminal for use by
process Engineers at work 

  If anyone can EMail me any recommended packageshorror storiesetc
I would be greatful

		Thanks in advance

			Mark Wilkinson

Well thanks largely to subscribers of this group here's xrastool 
the animation package I started just over  weeks ago A number of the
solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in
the code so have a look The full blurb has been posted to
compwindowsxannounce

This post is in two parts To unpack the source code extract the
articles into file and file for example Use a text editor to
remove leading and trailing text at the cut here markers
including the markers themselves Next type cat file file 
file then uudecode file and zcat xrastooltarZ  tar xvf 
Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there
Enjoy

Derek

PS The source is also available for anon ftp from exportlcsmitedu
in the contrib directory If there is enough demand a static binary
will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include
files

Hello everybody out there 

I'm trying to compile XRpl and Motif  on a HP running
HPUX  But it' seems to be not very succesful because 
I have only hpcf configfiles for HPUX  

I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings
The motif applications are compiled quite well but they won't run
I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ but
I cannot fix it The XKeysymDBfile is at the right location and it
works fine under SunOS
Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong
configfile

Please help me 
  
Thanx in advance 
  Markus

Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and
it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already  and
can point me to some tools that would help What they'd like to do is
Given a window that is taking a long time to draw because either  the
data  is  arriving  over a slow link or the DISPLAY is across a slow
link they would like to first paint a lowresolution version of  the
picture  and then repaint it in higher resolution  Thus the picture
might first be generated in  resolution with each  x  square  of
pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color  Next each x square
would be replaced by  x squares finally the x version  would  be
painted

Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side
of a slow link the lowres version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted
as  a bitmap that wouldn't help at all  Instead there would have to
be a process on the far end that receives the  lowres  picture  as  a
small  bitmap  and  blows up each pixel into a square sorta like the
magnifier programs do  This brings up the question of whether the  X
server  can help  That is when a window is opened is there a way to
ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels  Or  is  the
only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process
Permission denied  and have it open a local window

It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up
such  a  program  remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each
one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to  expand
But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help it's be nice
to hear about it  I looked in several FMs  but  if  it's  there  I
obviously  don't  know  the keywords   If someone has a nifty tool
available that packages it all we might want to get a copy

Oh yes this is to run on some Suns  Part of the idea  is  to  build
demos  that  can  show such things as If this were run across say a
bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear  Then  the
customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for

 
If the auto industry were like the computer industry a car would  now
cost  would get  miles to the gallon and at random times would
explode killing all its passengers

If you installed X lib Xt by redefining ProjectRoot you will find that
 during the install it recompiles one of the files in X lib that does the
search for XKeysmDB and embeds the search path for the file based on whatever
ProjectRoot was defined TO confirm this what happened because I'm 
guessing go to mitlibX and do
strings XStrKeySymo  egrep XKeysymDB

 This file describes version  of Ghostscript 



 An overview of Ghostscript 


Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides

         An interpreter for the Ghostscript language which very
closely resembles the PostScript TM language and

         A set of C procedures the Ghostscript library that
implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive
operations in the Ghostscript language

The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely
in C with some assemblylanguage accelerators for MSDOS platforms
Currently Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform
families

         IBM PC and compatibles with EGA VGA SuperVGA or compatible
          graphics under MSDOS   or 

         A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 
          release   and  including Sun Sun Suni
          Sun SPARCStation  generic  machines running ix
          HP  and  DECStation  and  VAX
          running Ultrix Sequent Symmetry Convex C and C
          Tektronix  SGI Iris Indigo

         Sun workstations Sun SPARC Suni running SunView

         VAX VMS with XR gcc and DEC C compiler DEC C compiler
          version  or later is required


Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview

This makes the Meta' keys behave as dead keys

Of course this only works for xterm For emacs my solution is to install the

Hi All
       This is the first time I've posted to the net so I hope this is
going to the right people
  I'm looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that
allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC 
  The idea is to use the PC as a cheap X windows terminal for use by
process Engineers at work 

May I humbly suggest DESQviewX Of course I'm biased

DESQviewX is a multitasker for DOS computers that uses a standard
XR server as it's display mechanism DOS applications and Microsoft
Windows standard mode are converted onthefly to Xprotocol allowing
you to display them or any R compatable Xprogram from any machine
on the net to display to the PC's local display or to any other display
on the net

Free tools are available for devloping Xapplications for the DVX platform
many Xprograms have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or
no modifications Often you only need to create a new makefile

If you're interested in more details you can check out the usenet group
composmsdosdesqview or just email me directly at supportqdeckcom
and I'd be happy to fill you in

If you already own all the clone equipment then there are lots of such
programs see a current copy of Unix World Magazine

BUT  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone
From experience  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this
is a new install  The performance will be at least four times better
In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use  On top of that
they will cost about the same price a clone with MB RAM ethernet card
very high performance graphics card GOOD monitor server software TCPIP
for clone software mouse keyboard etc etc etc you spend a whole
lot of 

I can get  Tektronix XP terminals for under  and the performance
is over  Xstones

I've spent the past week tearing my hair out trying to get the output of
a piped tail f to end up in a widget  I've managed to make it work in
some ugly ways but either a X blocks on the tail and won't allow user
input b the tail f functions like just tail and doesn't follow the
expansion of the file c the tail f doesn't die after I've closed
the pipe and destoryed the widget or d pclose blocks forever waiting
for tail to die
	I know this code has to exist  Anybody have it  A general
popen case would be perfered but at this point I'll take anything
Thanks

  Hi people


  I'm looking for X Servers for DOS or Windows

  I've already seen DesqviewX and XVision but I'd like to be
 aware of other choices

  Is there anything on the public domain or shareware 

  And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive
 pricing 

  What about incompatibilities  Window managers 

  Any info is welcome



  Thanx in advance

 Ever since I started to use Xwindows which is to say recently I've
 accumulated a few questions about Xapplications  Three examples follow
 
  It was recently mentioned on composlinux that there exists a post
    script viewer  I am interested in this and any Xeditor that is an
    improvement on Xedit which I find annoying

Try to get axe  It's a wonderful X based editor and much simpler to use than
emacs what is a overkill Of course emacs is no editor but a religion

  At one point I was the proud owner of an Amiga and have since upgraded
    to a '  Workbench the pointand click interface used info
    files to store the data for icons associated with applications on a given
    volume  I have noticed no such architecture anywhere under linux how
    does Xwindows associate icons with applications  Can one edit icons or
    generate new ones for applications somehow  If it makes a difference
    I'm running 'twm'

 Don't call going from an Amiga to a IBM 'upgrade'
 The Amiga Workbench did the job of a Desktop manager and there is no
   really amazing good X Desktop manager in the Public Domain
   I'm currently writing one but it's in very early stage
 xdtm may be a medium good replacement
 X associates icons with nothing A number of X Window Managers associate
   icons with windows in a way to ease window management
   But this has nothing to do with icons of a Desktop Manager application
 The tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing

  I've noticed some people have somehow discovered a way to display GIF
    or some kind of picture files in the background either replacing or
    overlapping some the usual grey background employed by Xwindows  I heard
    this was done using some application but I don't recall what it was

xv root max quit whateverimagefile

   Here's a listing that I came accross a while ago  This question seems to 
come up often enough that I figured this would be of interest  Note that 
the server X Appeal for DOS is available in demo form on the internet via 
anonymous ftp  This is one way of quickly checking out the feasability of 
using your system as an X server  Enjoy

This is a monthly guide of X servers that can be used on nonUNIX
networked machines to display X clients running on UNIX machines  I
use the name UNIX loosely here  I know others can run X

The sources for this information come from many places  the FAQ for
compwindowsx blurbs and info packets from the vendors user manuals
for the products themselves conversations with sales representatives
personal experience compwindowsx articles etc

I've written an application for SparcStation  GX under OpenWindows 

The application uses XView stuff to create my window and the SUN XGL
graphics library for rendering into the Canvas

The application does realtime D animation but it does not update the
the display fast enough
I'm using notifysetitimer XView call to periodically kick off my
update routine and it's not happening fast enough I want it to
update  times  second It's only doing about  Also it appears to
be compute bound because if I run anything else while my appplication is
up the update rate slows down even more

Any ideas 
Thanks

  I'm running HPUX  with HP VUE  and I need a hardcopy of
  the login window the one asking  for login and password to 
  include in a manual 
  I have tried
   xwd display hostname root out loginxwd 

  from a login on a remote terminal but it doesn't work 
  Xwd seems to wait for the window server but the window
  server doesn't answer 

  Any suggestions I must use xwd because I don't have access to
  ftp and I can't obtain another program to grab the screen

  Thanks in advance

BUT  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone
From experience  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this
is a new install  The performance will be at least four times better
In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use  On top of that
they will cost about the same price a clone with MB RAM ethernet card
very high performance graphics card GOOD monitor server software TCPIP
for clone software mouse keyboard etc etc etc you spend a whole
lot of 

I can get  Tektronix XP terminals for under  and the performance
is over  Xstones

I think your performance will depend upon the X server 

I'm running Linux and XFree on a Mhz DX with MB of RAM MB swap and
it runs just fine  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals
in the labs at school anyway

You could probably outfit a SX with a minimal LinuxX setup for 
and be better off than with an Xterminal IMHO

 I have a problem which many of you might have run into  We use LOTS of
 ASCII terminals and use them to the max  Meaning lots of attributes line
 draw etc   Now what I need to do is come up with a working xterm which
 will emulate our advanced ASCII terminals as closely as possible
 
 This means needing all attributes to work including bold and line drawing
 The only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in
 which one is bold and the other normal while both have linedraw fixed
 spacing and several sizes
 
 The only standard fonts which work are the fonts like x and xB under
 misc  They work great except I need a font one size larger x  Now
 x works well but there is no bold counterpart
 
 To make matters worse I need the fonts in some form I can use for Tektronix
 Xterminals  It seems they like pcf format although I should be able to
 convert a bdf format
 
 Anyone have any suggestions

This would be tedious but if you have the time you could get the bdf
file I can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access 
to the X source and could make your own bold font from this  Since each
glyph is just a bitmap you could write a program to convert each
glyph to a bitmapreadable file use bitmap to make each glyph bold and
convert the results back to bdf format  Then use bdftopcf to create
the pcf file  Then stick the pcf in usrlibXfontsmisc or wherever
and include it in fontsdir and voila you'll have what you need

  How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors
  and then erase it without having to redraw everything else

  What's happening is this

      If I draw it using GXcopy it is drawn in the specified color  If I erase
      it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed it erases 
      whatever it overlayed  I then need to redraw
      all of the items it crossed  Yuch

      If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color  nothing 
      resembling what I requested  It properly restores the color of 
      underlying objects in erase mode

  What's the solution

Hi
I have a lots of problems using XView libraries Release  in order to
do the following
 I want to create a MODAL Dialog which block the program flow
  a syncronous dialog ala Macintosh  as the Notice Panel
  does but with Text Item List Item and other XView objects
 The MODAL Dialog also must allows the Timer to be called why
  Notice doesn't do that
 
The problems are
 Using the xvwindowloop functions most XView objects dont work
  as the List Item and the timers aren't called
 
 With the notifydispatch explicit I have problem because
  never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback
  routine as say the XView Programming Manual Third Edition
  on page  uhm I know this number 
  But I need to do dispatching just inside a callback routine
 
Help me please

	Yes it is  It is available at ftpctrcolumbiaedu probably
in pubxkernel  

	In response to the earlier gentlemans question you could
theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun  The binaries available are
for the sun but the author says it could be used on most

I am planning to convert my Motif  app from pixel to font units
which would all be set in the app's resource file instead of hard coded
in the program

However the word here is from people who tried this already that for
some unknown reason XmForm offsets placed in the resource file are still
interpreted in pixel units forcing people to code those offset font units into the program

Can somebody confirm this

Hi folks

I'm trying to compile xfig  on a SS running SunOS  and OW 
and I'm having a little trouble with makeimake  Specifically make bombs
when it needs to use any Xaw file  This isn't surprising since X files
on Suns with the standard OW  distribution are in various places under
usropenwin Xaw files are in usropenwinshareincludeXXaw 
Actually the real problem is that I know squat about imake and I don't
know how to tell imake where the X files are  I can see from the 
Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places but the first line of the 
Makefile reads 

    Makefile generated by imake  do not edit

Help  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to
look  I have set DEFINES  DOPENWINBUG as it said to in the README
file

Email and post are both fine

Thanks in advance

What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for
some time  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call
xlock program

	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver which locks my screen
or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time  Or is there a

Xm is a user interface framework for the C language built upon X
and the XToolkit It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming
interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets
Xm was initially created for the Motif widget set now support for the
Athena widgets was added Applications created with Xm run in both
environments without changes although many nice features are only
available when using Motif
In some situations Xm extends the underlying toolkit ie providing
a ComboBox borrowed from MSWindows but never tries to replace it 
data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated
in rare cases

Xm has nothing common with Motif besides the general idea to
encapsulate Motif widgets in C objects and the '' in it's name Many
ideas for the Xm architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version
which provides an easy to use framework for WindowsPMMac applications
in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and
a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm dialogs 

Top level objects in Xm
 'Windows' 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout
  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw
 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface
  builder a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this
  distribution

Controls children of top level objects
'staticText' 'staticImage' 'pushButton' 'checkBox' 'radioButton'
'edit' 'listBox' 'comboBox' 'groupBox' 'paneArea' 'drawing' 'toolBar'

The staticImage and all the button classes can display bw Xbitmap
format or color GIF format pictures as an alternative to a label text

Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects
Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm objects


CommonInteractII is built upon the Xm drawing class and provides
components for building direct manipulative applications Is is a very
simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system
research project of our institute in  an approach to define a
software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications
with multiple interaction media ie sound alternative input devices
If you are interrested look into the June  issue of the JOOP SIGS
Publications  Journal of Object Oriented Programming  there should be
our paper about CommonInteract but be aware that it is our 'state of
the art' from 
CommonInteractII is still undocumented and is included because it was
used to implement the dialog editor It currently supports only drawing
primitives lines rectangles circles but we plan to extend it to
support bitmaps and some controls also
Known problem the Xm drawing class has no redrawing strategy always
redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an
object this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed


About this first release

Xm is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here
for smaller applications which are running without problems So I think
I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications
for any noncritical purposes
CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release' It's development will
be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research
project here Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems
to be stable and can be used for experimental applications

Platforms this release was compiled and tested on
  HP running HPUX 
  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 
  PCAT running Linux vpl

Caution although the whole stuff was initially developed using an ATT
standard C compiler  this release is tested only with GNU g  or
above the next release will be tested with both compilers

I'm running Linux and XFree on a Mhz DX with MB of RAM MB swap and
it runs just fine  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals
in the labs at school anyway


You will not come even CLOSE to the performance of an XP series plus you 

Excuse me but with a  k cache S  ISA card Mb XS XR running bsd  you can get k xstones at x Mhz which I doubt 
that your XP series gets Commerical verions X servers for S  cards
can get k xstones So the performance is there and additionally since
is running unix multiple users can use the system which I have done in
my home setup

Maintenance is minimal if you can read README files for the X servers and
for bsd

I am just beginning to try using the Athena toolkit and am having some problems 
getting started  I think that some files are missing on the system but there is
the possibility that they are just in a different directory  When I try to link
my program it can't find XtInitailize XtRealizeWidget XtMainLoop 
XtCreateManagedWidget or commandWidgetClass  I've included Intrinsich and
Commandh  I also had a problem on compile with XtNcallback but replaced that with
a NULL in order to compile and see if there were any other problems  I haven't 
used a toolkit before and this is simply an example I got from the manuel  Can
someone tell me where I might look for these calls that is in what file not what
directory they are supposed to be under because the system manager doesn't believe
in standard directories and generally does things his own way  I am using UNIX

Thank you for your assistance

 OH BOY have I wanted this too  However I believe that the cursor will
 be under the server's control could be wrong  On an Xterminal for
 example if the server was NOT the one controlling the cursor then trying
 to get the xterm application to do the blinking would cause needless and
 yucky network overhead consistantly
 


Most people who write cursor blinking code just implement the simple case a
straight msec or so onoff cycle  However the cursor will work much
better if cursor blinking is suppressed ie the cursor is made visible any
time the cursor moves and for  to  sec thereafter  If you don't do this the
cursor will be hard to track when in motion

You allways could port and use emu from exportlcsmiteducontribemutarZ
We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned
You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor horizontal  ver
tical line cursors smaller block cursors turn on and off blinking
set the blink rate and so on You even get blinking text  ok enough
advertising

I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect but from the memories
I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted mostly the blinking text I'd say it won't be easy since
xterm is a hairy mess understandable if you follow it's roots back to
X

The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you
provide the right hooks As Antonio mentioned you'll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved or people will become confused
Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 
do anything on screen anyways this isn't very complicated You'll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
it's mapped

As for the portability of emu and it's newest version The one on export
is still the same as on the R contrib tape We wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now but unfortunately we're drowning in work
But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much I'd say
whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version

As is emu won't work on BSD derived systems eg SUNs with anything else 
than a csh There is a fix to this which is very short remove one line
of code I'll put this on export today

Yes that is a bug in the Xr port of xterm You sometimes get this when
you start from XDM I have reported this to Casper but don't know whether
it made it into his set of patches yet

Basically in mitclientsxtermmainc there is a test at line  which
checks errno after attempting to open devtty Add the errno  EINVAL
case to it and you should be fine

It's actually a bug in the Solaris  kernel We could add a workaround to
xterm open should never return EINVAL but it does 

I didn't have time to update the RSunOS patch lately but non
of the existing problems seem to warrant a new set of patches

Since xsession is a Bourne shell script anyway you might as well add a line
	 etcTIMEZONE
as it is done in etcprofile

XDM coulda also keep the XDM environment variable It should have inherited
it from the environment

I've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got I
think  Building was easy After installing everything I started X but
nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed the machine seemed
to hang I loged in from another machine an found the Suni running well
'ps' told me that there's a Xserver and a xterm running And with some 
experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing D I blindly hit the
xterm endet the session and got my prompt back
I guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet
I've got a Suni with a bw framebuffer ACE  V Rev 
SunOS  and ROM 
Please help me I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to
other machines but that's not what I did it for

Thanks in advance

Ok I'm being driven batty

Trying to create popupmenus ie button press and a menu
appears  I would really like to use the standard Athena
classes to achieve this goal but for my best attempts
I cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton
as the parent of the widget tree  I know this should be
possible to to with an XtPopupSpringLoaded and a
little twiddling but something is escaping me

Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu  Positioning the SimpleMenu
The reference is to the R documentation

I had not done this before but in less than  mins I knocked up the following
Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget Even if you are
not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what
is going on The crucial thing is the use of the XawPositionSimpleMenu and
MenuPopup actions


AriwcChildren		app

			BtnDown XawPositionSimpleMenumenu MenuPopupmenu

Excuse me but with a  k cache S  ISA card Mb XS XR running bsd  you can get k xstones at x Mhz which I doubt 

Nice but way over 
My point is priceperformance  not just performance

  You will not come even CLOSE to the performance of an XP series plus you 
  
  Excuse me but with a  k cache S  ISA card Mb XS XR running bsd  you can get k xstones at x Mhz which I doubt 
 
 This is hardly apples to apples Try running the benchmark over a
 network to the clone and and if you're still getting K Xstones
 then you've got a good machine X terminals aren't just a server you know
 
 	Graeme Gill

I would further add that a SmbmbDISK is going to cost
WAY more than  probably   Color makes it not applesapples too
Xterminals provide better priceperformance than PCs  You can make a PC
much cheaper and perform much worse and you can make PC's perform great and
cost more  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
of a PC  For home user that extra functionality is worth the added cost

Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library
For Network discussion

Color Coordination

    I tried to start a discussion in compwindowsx' at the start of the
  year about some sort of standard color table' that icons should follow
  say  to  colors including  colors for a small grey scale but no
  one responded at all

    The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willynilly
  you will soon find that the workstations color table devotes itself
  solely the window manager icons and other adminstrative tasks' instead
  of applications that actually require the colors for proper working
  Color needful applications'' such as   Picture and graphic displayers
  Animation Real Time video Raytracers etc 

    The following is a suggested color table for icons and general use
  Icons Window Managers and general applications should follow this
  table or something like it UNLESS the application is color needful''

      for each primary color redgreenblue three colors
             EG values     and 
       This results in      colors  representing most of the
       standard colors for use in icons

      two extra shades of grey
             EG vales    black     and  whitered

       other colors  probably of some primary color to provide shading
       a and D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager

    This table represents  colors and represents a large range of
  posibilities for the above administrative services'' of the
  workstation

 Does anyone out there know of a way to have a UNIX machine automatically
 set it's display variable to that of the Xterm you're using when it's
 not the machine that's serving you X 

 The best I've been able to come up with has been a rather convoluted 
 script that extracts your IP  from the whos command and it 
 frequently fails not to mention that it requires having your user
 name added to it

From my own notes on this subject

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another
  This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current
DISPLAY that is being used

 Use rshrexecon  the method in the xauth manual
      Set up the your rhosts file in the home directory on the remote
  machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands

         xauth extract  DISPLAY  rsh other xauth merge 

  This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization My vampire
  program also uses a variation however I wrap it as part of the remote
  command sequence  EG  xauth add auth

     Included in this method is the use of xrlogin' and xrsh' to do
  this job for you These programs usally the newer ones that is allow
  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes
  the DISPLAY' andor a copy of the authorization code required

     The xon' program available if enabled on sun machines will also
  pass environment variables as well as the current directory  You will
  however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for
  passing Unless you are also have shared home directories

    WARNING Environment variables and command line arguments are visible
  in ps' listing with the appropiate flags As such passing authorization
  information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended
  The recommended method as given in the manual shown above is safe from
  the view of other users

 Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable
      This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass
  the TERM environment variable to the remote host It is then a matter of
  an appropiate script in your remote login file to extract the information
  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly
    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does
  this Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the
  actual call to rlogin is performed to include your DISPLAY and your
  authorization
    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the
  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or
  stty'ing your terminal

  
  script for launching rlogin
    binsh
     binrl    Rlogin with display
    if  n DISPLAY  then
      case DISPLAY in
         DISPLAYhostnameDISPLAY 
      esac
      TERMTERMDISPLAYxauth nextract  DISPLAY
      export TERM
    fi
    rlogin 
  
  add to your cshrc or login
    if  TERM  then
      if  echo TERM  tr cd ''  ''  then
        echo TERM  cut 'd' f  xauth nmerge 
        setenv DISPLAY echo TERM  cut 'd' f
        setenv TERM    echo TERM  cut 'd' f
      endif
    endif
  
  xterm command to use
    xterm T hostname e binrl hostname
  

 NFS
     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to
   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted then authorization
   is automatically passed Hoever you will still have to pass your
   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means IE

      login host       echo DISPLAY  Xhost
      remote host      setenv DISPLAY cat Xhost

 Finger for the info in a plan file
      This involves encrypting the information into your plan' or
  project' and having the remote machine finger for the information
  This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering
  the user  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each
  individual  IE the method of decyrption must not be shared or known
  by others nor should it be easy to determine
    A improvment is to use the who fingered me' technique to only give
  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone
  who is asking
    This last method was developed last year by a second year here untill
  I explained to him the need for the encryption at which point he gave
  up this method It is however a valid method It is easer than  but
  less secure

Subject VXT Windowing Terminal Help

Greetings


We have several VXT  Windowing terminals and associated software on our
network  We are able to open a LAT terminal window to any of our workstation
nodes but we are unable to get a LAT X session to work

We have customized the terminal security to allow all LAT connections

Trying to invoke a LAT X session from the VXT  results in the following
message being displayed in the terminal manager window message area

Host Does Not Support X Sessions

The host is a VAX Model  and does support X sessions


Opening a LAT terminal window and logging into the server node setting the
display variable as follows

 set displaycreatenodeLATtransportlat

and then trying to create a decterm on the VXT as follows

 createtermdectermdetach

Fails and gives the following error message

dectermport failed to find language XOpenDisplay  returned NULL
DECWFCANTOPENDISPL Can't open display

The VXT  is using its system defaults ie default fonts language 
except for the security options to allow all connections and options enabling 
LAT protocol

we have VT windowing terminals and the above things were enough to allow
LAT X sessions

VMS Version is 
Running DECwindowsMotif of VAX Model s


Please help

This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking



I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new
server  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly and through
debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on
which for some arcane reason means to blank the screen

My problem is that this function is never being called again with on even
after I have moved the mouse andor typed some keys  My question is  what am
I likely to be missing that would cause this problem  I copied the basic
design of my function from the existing versions

static Bool nextsavescreenscron
ScreenPtr scr
Bool on


   this was copied from the omron server code  is it the right way 
  if on  SCREENSAVERON 
		nextSetLastEventTime
  

  if on  SCREENSAVERON   Save user's current setting 
		nextsavescreenbrightness  NXScreenBrightnessmyeventhandle
		NXSetScreenBrightness myeventhandle   Blank the screen 
  
  else 											  Unblank the screen 
		NXSetScreenBrightness myeventhandle nextsavescreenbrightness
  

  return TRUE


I can see in the serveros code where the screensaver is called to turn on the
saver but I cannot find where it wakes up the server and unblanks the
screen

Any tipshelp would be appreciated

Thanks

Yes Don't confuse the mouse cursor with the text cursor in the xterms
The latter is only controlled by the application
Back in the days of X I did analyse the xterm code The cursor 
was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character I doesn't
seem to be changed 'til now
But if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
XtAppAddTimeOut or similar 

XtAppAddTimeout doesn't work in xterm because despite appearances 
to the contrary xterm is not really an Xt based application  Other
sources like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterm's main
loop So don't be surprised when you try this and it doesn't work

I have a problem which many of you might have run into  We use LOTS of
ASCII terminals and use them to the max  Meaning lots of attributes line

This means needing all attributes to work including bold and line drawing
The only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in
which one is bold and the other normal while both have linedraw fixed
spacing and several sizes

The only standard fonts which work are the fonts like x and xB under
misc  They work great except I need a font one size larger x  Now
x works well but there is no bold counterpart


You don't need a 'bold' counterpart From man xterm

       fb font
               This  option specifies a font to be used when dis
               playing bold text  This font  must  be  the  same
               height  and width as the normal font  If only one
               of the normal or bold fonts is specified it  will
               be  used as the normal font and the bold font will
               be  produced  by  overstriking  this  font    The
               default  is to do overstriking of the normal font

I have tried that with one font if your xterm terminfostermcaps are set up
to NOT remap bold which they are be default to reverse then nothing happens
when bold is displayed  It would appear at least in XR than you cannot
display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts a normal and a bold
I wish someone would prove that incorrect

 I'm quite familiar with a variety of window title setting methods
 
 My question is  Is there any way via Resources etc to stop an
 application's ability to rename it's own Name  IconName properties
 

Sorry that's a feature  The ICCCM specifies how the app should set its title so the wm is obliged to do it  If this bothers you complain to the app writer

 who cares if it's not 'nice' to the application 
 
 	I WANT CONTROL 
 

Write your own wm that doesn't support the ICCCM  Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title  The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it your program switches it back again

I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PCbased X server However
after an interval of no activity my X session ends This does not
happen when I use xscreensaver 

My screensave command is fired up from my xsession like this

xautolock time  locker xnlock corners  cornerdelay  

My hypothesis is that xdm I use xdmcp to start my X session detects
a period of inactivity from the server then terminates the session
However for some reason this does not happen with xscreensaver Is
there a workaround

I'd prefer responses via email

Thanks

Hi

I'm trying to get my program to monitor resizeposition events
so that when the program exits I can save the last known geometry in 
some sort of 'preferences' file

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell

 XtAddEventHandlertopLevelStructureNotifyMaskFalseconfigureCBmyData

This works fine and my callback is called whenever the window is resized
or repositioned using the window manager mwm

However when I'm just resizing the window using any resize handle on the
window manager resize decoration the x and y are set to zero in the
XEvent passed to the event handler callback  I'm accessing the xconfigure
structure like the X manual says  xevxconfigurex xevxconfigurey
The width and height memebers are correct

When I reposition the window using the window manager the xevent's xconfigure
structure contains all the correct x y width height member settings

Q Anybody know why when just resizing the x and y are being set to zero

Q Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes

I've tried using XtGetValues on the topLevel widget when exiting my
application before destroying any widgets and all I get is garbage values
for the x y width height resources

Thanks

If you are running Sun OpenWindows you can use pageview  This is an

Yes but it's broken on OW   It does not handle multiple pages
well  If you don't have the proper PostScript commands it will
draw the entire document on the same page instead of pausing after
each page  I haven't tried OW  yet though

OW  is the same  But the definition of broken is relative  Pageview
requires DSC compliant PostScript files in order to stop at page breaks
I don't consider that broken  I say that any program that puts out a
PostScript file that isn't DSC compliant is broken

Keywords imake make Solaris

dplelungtainforescom david levine writes

Hey folks
I'm attempting to use imake to manage makefiles for a development effort and was curious
to find out if anybody else is experiencing problems with any target that
has subdirs generated by imake on Solaris  platforms 

For example 'make makefiles' chokes in the very first subdirectory 

	ie target subdirMakefiles not found 

You don't give the precise error message but I assume that
the making of the target fails because make can't find the rules

We've seen this happen with SunOS x make as well and aat this
point I'm not sure why it happens It seems to happen
with large Makefiles The entries near the end get lost
Small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem
as it does in your example

In the MIT R distribution  RSunOSpatch this can happen with
the target Makefiles'' in one of the doc directories

At first I thought this was a bug with make on my Sun but I built and used gnumake with the
same results Attached you'll find the first Makefiles target rule from the generated makefile

This is really weird Are your really sure that you were using GNU make

As quoted from Maymoepidoopende by bernwardmoepidoopende Bernward Averwald

 Back in the days of X I did analyse the xterm code The cursor 
 was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character I doesn't
 seem to be changed 'til now
 But if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
 XtAppAddTimeOut or similar 

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though see also DESQviewX
which does this in its DOS windows  Do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt

After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing

   My problem with the resolution x foints is due to an installation 
     problem

   That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find
     to meet your requirements  

     This means that if you server return a response like the following

     adobehelveticamediumonormalpiso

     You can ask for the follwogin

        adobehelveticamediumonormalpiso
 
     and it will generate it for you  You should try to always use 
     known pixel sizes

so I just linked ln s the files from usropenwinshareincludeX and 
now the ghoddam thing still complains it can't find them

I still haven't been able to compile xdvi not no way

Has anyone ever managed to get anything normal to compile on a Sun

I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets

                       callbacks and actions

The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code
that performs a lot of drawing into a window I want to connect this to a
widget No problem so far I could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards

But because the drawing takes some while I want the application code sequence
to be able to be interrupted by events Then I want to handle the events
and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
interrupted
It seems to me that this isn't possible but how can I give the user the
impression that his inputs are immediately processed 

Has anybody an idea

Please answer via email

twice at porting emu to linux but stopped short becuse of the tty
part Is there a cleaner' version of emu that supports POSIX tty
explicitly

Hmm depends on how you define 'clean' Jordan implemented the system
dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for
call it operating system types then you go ahead and write a include
file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic
implementations Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a 
OS flavor yet that is fully POSIX we haven't gotten around to
really implement and test a toplevel include file specifically
for just posix The posix routines are used in the sun specific file
ttysuni for example but here we also use some bsd stuff All in all
it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and
every operating system than 'ifdef'ing in existing ones The type
of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm
sources Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a 
couple of times this only uses up some disk space since only the 
drivers actually included from the toplevel include file will be 
compiled into emu

It shouldn't be hard to come up with a ttylinuxi file that fully
relies on the posix stuff but unfortunately I don't have a linux
system available to me so I can't do the port myself I would suggest
you read the README in termsysdep and if you have any problems or
questions contact me and we could try to sort this out Unfortunately
we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu since we 
just don't have access to that many different systems

Hello

Below I have the copy of some source I am using to setup a userspecified color
map for X R V I am attempting to create user defined colors in terms of
RGB color ranges The calls to XAllocColor prove ineffective 

Variables are defined are as follows

    int                 i j k lutindex

    XColor              rgbcolor hardwarecolor

Hi all
I have this program in which user can display many images onebyone on the
display Now I am trying to get the best poosible color allocation So
each time I open a image I try to allocate the colors reqd for that image
approach similar to that used in xv by john bradley The problem 
comes when I try to display the next image Now I have effectively tied
myself to the colors of the previous image So the second image doesnot come
up in original colorsie the colors it would have shown had it been
displayed first 
I know that I can display only  colors or whatever depth of the display
at a time But I also dont want the color reproduction dependent on the
sequence in whihc you display the image 
So what is the best way out

Please rewpond to vijayiitbernetin

When I changed from SVR to SVR on my Intel box I discovered that
some of my SVR xclients such as xload etc would no longer work


They bomb out with the message

error can't open display unix

Is this because they can't find the correct shared libraries they need
to be recompiled or have I not used the correct options

Both systems use XR

I've run into a bit of a snag while trying to get Mac X up and running and would appreciate
any responses from anyone who may have seen this problem

On my local network I have a number of Macs Suns and SGI machines

I have installed MacXMacTCP on all of the Macintoshes and can run Xclients on the SGI machines
all the livelong day  The problem is when I try to run an Xclient on any Sun I setup
the command in MacX then execute it  Nothing happens I don't even get any command output

Now I thought it might be a routing issue but I can run remote Xclients on the suns from my SGI
machines as well as viceversa  I can also run remote Xclients on SGI machines that
are NOT on my local net here but the above problem holds true for nonlocal Suns as well

I tried to send this as private mail but mail to benjossahqnasagov was
rejected so here it is

Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX

Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands 
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine  This is due 
to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
requesting machines that are not known to the Suns network address etchosts
or NIS hosts database  To successfully use remote commands with a SunOSbased
machine there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
Macintosh which is running MacX

Thanks to Bruce Barnett who recommended xvttool and Bernward Averwald and
Liam Quin who recommended modifying Xdefaults to get the desired behavior
for a class of xterms

In xvttool simply create a key file that looks like
a	A
b	B
c	C

and specify said key file on the command line  This will translate
any input into any other in my case locase to upcase  Works great and
you get a customizable buttonpad on the right or left side

To use an xterm solution add to your Xdefaults
capxtermVTTranslations override 
   Keya stringAn
   

or
capxtermvttranslations override n
        Keya insertstringA n
        Keyb insertstringB n
        

and invoke as xterm name capxterm

Excerpts from netnewscompwindowsx May Re COLORS and X windows
A John Cwiklamorrisonwri  

 The problem is that we need solutions for applications now  And although 
 I would love to have most of the things mentioned here somebody has to write 
 it 

What I'd like to see is this scenario 

Each widget view whatever describes it's colors via a palette 
Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information 
They are not directly tied to the object that uses them  Palettes are
held in the server  A palette can accomadate up to the number of
hardware color cells of color descriptors 

When the input focus is in a particular widget that widget has access
to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette  ALL
OTHER WIDGETS TRANSIENTLY GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE
GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE
COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER 

A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index pixel
into its associated palette 

The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server

 I understood that there are two methods to connect application code
to widgets
 
                        callbacks and actions
 
 The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of
application code
 that performs a lot of drawing into a window I want to connect this
to a
 widget No problem so far I could use a callback function or an
action to do this processing any events afterwards
 
 But because the drawing takes some while I want the application code
sequence
 to be able to be interrupted by events Then I want to handle the
events
 and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
 interrupted
 It seems to me that this isn't possible but how can I give the user
the
 impression that his inputs are immediately processed 
 
Use a workProc  See XtAppAddWorkProcXt

You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks this
is the hard part  Then in the callback that starts the drawing
you call XtAppAddWorkProc to call your workProc the first time 
Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean
TRUE when you are finished and FALSE when you want to keep
processing  If you return FALSE the workProc is automatically
reinstalled  

Note that this method is better that using a timeout loop since
events get processed in a more precedenceoriented manner  If you
are using the same Ada bindings I am however you are hosed and
should look into XtAppAddTimeoutXt

I know nothing about Sun's but replacing pieces of libraries shared
or not is straight forward on RS's all releases  Extract the
appropriate pierce with ar rebind the o and replace with ar

Hi netters

We have a problem with 'makedepend' it doesn't know how to correctly process
if clause in C preprocessor statements It evaluates everything to
true no matter what the conditionals are
For example makedepend chokes on one of X include files as distributed
by Sun  namely Xosh

if     definedSUNOS  definedSTDC
       include stringh
       define  index   strchr
       define  rindex  strrchr
else    BSD  STDC 
       include stringsh
endif   SUNOS  STDC 

Here 'makedepend' evaluates both if and corresponding else statements
to 'true' and tries to open the file stringsh which doesn't exist
under Solaris
We also have a lot of if statements in some of our legacy code
We got and built 'makedepend' off the net  it didn't fix the problem

In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' manpage Sun's
distribution mentions this problem

BUGS
     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp  the  Berkeley  C
     preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
     that all if directives will evaluate to  true  regardless
     of  their  actual  value  This may cause the wrong include
     directives to be evaluated  Makedepend should  simply  have
     its own parser written for if expressions

Has anybody come up with some solutionfix to 'makdepend' other than
WriteYourOwnParser and willing to share it with us

Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed  please reply 
directly to my email address  I'll post a summary

Thanks in advance

Hi there


  Do someone of you have a program for sending a key event
to another window but it MUST appear in that window

I have used xsendeventtar package but it does not do that 

For example if I get a program executing


binsh
read something


echo something




and if I send the key event KeyPressaKeyReleasea
to that window then I will get

somethinga


Thanks in advance

 I've been getting mail from Xhibition about the June conference and I was
 wondering if Microsoft had bought Xhibition  The front says Conference

       Jesse W Asher                                          

Yes Xhibition is for the X Window System  The X Window System Conference 
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X  Nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirtysix technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for X application developers  Add vendor
exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today and you have a complete show focused on X

Speakers at Xhibition  include 

  Bob Schiefler Lu Abel Mark Ackerman Paul Asente Doug Blewett 
  Donna Converse Jim Fulton Oliver Jones Keith Packard Ralph Swick 
  Doug Young and many others

Xhibition is growing fortunately for us and we have added some additional
conferences  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest  These include object oriented technologies such as the Object
Management Group's ORB and CORBA C as it applies to X client server
technologies such as DCE threads databases object oriented and relational
and not surprisingly when you look at the audience Windows NT

With the bulk of the Xhibition audience and the UNIX community developing
applications for inhouse or custom use a new bit operating system from a
player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated With MS Windows on so many
desktops and the price of computing power dropping its successor needs to be
evaluated  As corporations begin to look at NT so must their developers and
suppliers

The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner  The NT Conference
at Xhibition is designed to do just that  We worked with Microsoft to provide
the only conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX
developers the capabilities of Windows and NT  If you aren't sure that NT has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment this is
the place to find out  Ask the folks from Microsoft get them to show you
what you need  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development
Kits to bang on evaluate and generally to see for yourself

I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial it should sound like an
Xhibition commercial  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience
is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it  The industry is a
confusing place at the moment with UNIX COSE NT DCE CORBA and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion

Most DOS X servers are terribly slow to use in my experience  and no I guess 
performance would be pretty bad I believe the discussion is valid for an X 
server on a decent workstation

When attempting to connect to an SGI Indigo from a PC clone using

a prelogin X screen mode  The login box won't display  Using
the package in 'telnet' mode I can logon to the SGI and run any

I have all access control disabled I believe SYSLOG message confirms

as described in the X ADm book by O'Rielly

I've run into a bit of a snag while trying to get Mac X up and running and would appreciate
 
 stuff deleted

are NOT on my local net here but the above problem holds true for nonlocal Suns as well

I tried to send this as private mail but mail to benjossahqnasagov was
rejected so here it is

same here


Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX

Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands 
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine  This is due 
to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
requesting machines that are not known to the Suns network address etchosts
or NIS hosts database  To successfully use remote commands with a SunOSbased
machine there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
Macintosh which is running MacX


I received similar informationadvice about what appears to be the same problem 
Benjamin has and I still have
NIS has all the information about the Macs
I even put explicit entries in etchosts to no avail
Monitoring with 'snoop' on my Classic the initial REXEC packet is sent to
the the SUN which sends something to the correct Mac but nothing appears
at the Mac
'rexecd' is number one suspect but it's more suble than the README suggests and
I haven't yet looked into it further

OW  is the same  But the definition of broken is relative  Pageview
requires DSC compliant PostScript files in order to stop at page breaks
I don't consider that broken  I say that any program that puts out a
PostScript file that isn't DSC compliant is broken

Well that may be true  However the man page for pageview for OW 
does not mention about DSC compliance  In any event the point here
is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will
find out that it's not a practical tool

It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need
to be DSC compliant  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the
right hand is doing at Sun  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview
program does require DSC compliant PostScript  There was the possibility that
it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it
would stop at each showpage  I believe that this method would preclude being
able to go backwards and forwards through the file ie you could only go
forward to the next showpage  This isn't in OW pageview but maybe it is
in the Solaris x version of OW OW 

In any event I find pageview extremely useful  Since all of the PostScript
that I produce IS DSC compliant I don't have any problems

As quoted from Maymoepidoopende by bernwardmoepidoopende Bernward Averwald

 Back in the days of X I did analyse the xterm code The cursor 
 was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character I doesn't
 seem to be changed 'til now
 But if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
 XtAppAddTimeOut or similar 

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though see also DESQviewX
which does this in its DOS windows  Do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt

So what I'm running emu on a  MHz  box I cannot make out ANY
difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
not If you think about it a bit a cycle of  ms is a hell a lot of
time for even the slowest PC Since you would of course only enable
the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus this 
application is active anyway To repeat it a blinking text cursor
costs almost nothing in performance it just needs some thought when
designing the xterm software

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop  What if you are on an
Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine  That is when the
load problems occur  If you had a machine with  Xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm's this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste

I'm not picking on you just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life
out there besides distributed or singleuser Workstations

The last time I taught the course I used a popular graphics text that
uses its own graphics package with implementations available for
XMacPC  The problem was that after the course the students were good
at programming in the artificial package but frustrated that they
couldn't really use their skill for other work

   Has anybody come up with some solutionfix to 'makdepend' other than

rewrite 'makedepend' to use 'cc M' or 'gcc M' or 'gcc MM' which is
the one I prefer since system headers don't change that often for
generating the actual dependencies  you'll still need to write the
parts that edit the actual Makefile  I think there's a program in the
Berkeley distributions called mkdep that will do essentially this

destroyed  Then I get a BadWindow error and my application exits

How can I make this robust  I've thought of the following
 
      Set up an X error handler that longjmps back to where I
        made the offending call  Is this safe  Do I have to
        longjmp or can I just return

BadWindow is an X protocol error  If you write a custom error handler
which does not do exit the error handler will return and let
your program carry on  So using a XSetErrorHandler is the way to
go but never mind the longjmp


      Register for DestroyNotify on all the windows returned from
        XQueryTree

I've read the FAQ I've fiddled around but I am still having problems getting
my poor old HP to let me inputdisplay characters above   I have 
the following in my Xdefaults

XTermFont        adobecourierboldrnormalmiso

So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm  I have NOT
set my LCCTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it it tells me that
that locale is not supported apparently we have no additional locales defined
or at least liblocale doesn't exist  I can get some of the characters
above  to print out but they are not where I'd expect them  for example
Altv does not produce a u umlaut  This leads me to believe that the fault
lies with the stty settings which are as follows

speed  baud line   susp undef dsusp undef
intr  C quit   erase  H kill  K swtch  
eof  D eol   min   time   stop  S start  Q

Anyway I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks and any help
anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated

         I am looking for info on products that can take

 Motif executable  Another requirement is that MFC  should
 be supported  I already know of
 
         WindU  by Bristol Technologies
         Hunter SDK
         MainWin by MainSoft
 
         Are there any others
 
 	I will post a summary if it's wanted


	I got a few requests asking for a summary so I'll attempt one
here


	Here's the ones I know of

	WindU		 Bristol Technologies

	Hunter SDK	 Hunter Systems

	MainWin		 MainSoft

	LIBWXM           Visual Solutions


	Hunter 

	The company is going through some big changes  I expect
to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name  At the moment it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info
Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down 

	Visual Solutions

	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about  They don't
yet support MDI or MFC  Libwxm was used to port VisSim a mathematical
modeling package  Does native Motif Widgets like WindU from Bristol
Contact Carrie Lemieux at    for more info  She's very helpful

	MainSoft

	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that
can switch off between a Windows or QuasiMotif look and feel at
runtime  They skip the Xt and Xm Motif X toolkit levels and go
straight to Xlib  They don't yet support MFC  They're at   

	Bristol

	This company that seems to be on the right track  WindU uses
XlibXtXm to give a real Motif app  They seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like DDE Common Dialogs and more on the horizon
My contact there is knowledgeable responds to my email and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles
They're at    or you can email infobristolcom

 I've found an hpgl viewer for X and a converter from HPGL
 to postscript Does anybody have anything that allows you
 to convert from anything into HPGL I'm desperately in need
 of something like this

HPGL does not support raster primitives so a formatter would have to 
punt on most popular image formats  This probably explains the lack of
translators out there  What do you need to plot

Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes
most standard GNU and other software won't compile out of the box well tar

Right now I'm trying to make ghostview It complains it can't find XXaW
so I just linked ln s the files from usropenwinshareincludeX and 
now the ghoddam thing still complains it can't find them

I still haven't been able to compile xdvi not no way

Has anyone ever managed to get anything normal to compile on a Sun
SunOS  and OpenWindows  What's the trick I'm missing I've even 
tried hard copying all the relevant files into the right places and
every time there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it

Sounds like you didn't load the support for those libraries when OW was
loaded  The Xaw support was missing from OW but added in

Hi

I am running XR on an IBM RS AIX  and XR on a Sun SunOS 

Since I run X on both colour and blackwhite displays I need different
values for the same resource so I want to use ifdef COLOR in my
application defaults files However cpp is only invoked by xrdb and
not when the resources are loaded on demand

Is there a proper solution to this

So far the only proper solution I've come to think of is to create 
different files in my appdefaults say XTerm and XTermcolor and
set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either HOMETN or HOMETNcolor
But that does not always seem to work eg executing a remote shell
command without reading the cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH

Furthermore I thought of using include XTerm in XTermcolor
However for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTermcolor
things are different on both machines On a Sun the FIRST found resource
is used ie the one from XTerm the bw one while on an RS the
LAST found value is used ie the one from XTermcolor What can I do
about it

I have one last question for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH I
can use T N C and S T stands for appdefaults N for the
resource class but what do C and S stand for

Thanks in advance for replying

   It will be presented in X's home turf I believe that the attendees
    will mostly have X backgrounds biases  thus I expect that the
    NT presentations will face a tough audience

   I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what
    it is hyped to be This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the
    NT technology without actually using it myself which I don't have the

   If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored there will be
    many other interesting tutorialspresentations that I won't have to
    waste my time  in California

I use those routines in a widget which only redraws exposed areas
here's a small piece of code that uses those routines

static void Redisplaypw ev region
XtpManagerWidget pw
XExposeEvent ev
Region region

 ppexposureregion is an XRegion 
XtpManagerPart pp  pwplotter
ppexposureregion  XCreateRegion
    region is passed via an expose event 
ifregion  NULL

if evsendevent   synthetic event sent by widget it wants a full redraw
        
        exporectx  pwcorex
        exporecty  pwcorey
        exporectwidth  pwcorewidth
        exporectheight  pwcoreheight
        
     else
        
        exporectx  evx
        exporecty  evy
        exporectwidth  evwidth
        exporectheight  evheight
        

stuff deleted      

 region now contains the exposure region 
        XUnionRectWithRegionexporectppexposureregionppexposureregion

else
        XUnionRegion  region ppexposureregion ppexposureregion
stuff deleted 
 WE NEED to CLIP on EXPOSE REGION for REDRAWING the GRID 
        XSetRegionXtDisplayOfObjectpw ppplotareagcppexposureregion
stuff deleted 
         check to see if child is exposed 
        if XRectInRegion pwplotterexposureregion
                         childcorex

                         childcorewidth  
                         childcoreheight 

So I build up a region of exposures so that when I service my container
widget redraw of rectobj children I only redraw what need to be redrawn

It works for me hope this helps you

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop  What if you are on an

they all had blinking cursors in xterm's this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste

Ethernet certainly has enough bandwidth for a few blinking cursors  My
Lisp Machine blinks the cursor twice a second and updates the time in the
status line every second  This uses under K bytessecond or about  of
the bandwidth of Ethernet  A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be
a problem but a couple dozen should be fine

Granted it's nothing to loose sleep over but this is Ethernet's tragic flaw
the more activity especially lots of tiny activity the more collisions
happen and the performance gets exponentially worse  I am just now
opposing ANY kind of waste of bandwidth under Ethernet  Although in a polling
system it would not be so bad

	I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each

	I've done this fine but I've turned up the following problem

	When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of
	the above events but when they are not sensitive I only get
	callbacks on LeaveWindow events  This seems odd  I would
	expect this to be an allornothing type of thing

	Is this a bug  If not can someone explain this behavior

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop  What if you are on an
Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine  That is when the
load problems occur  If you had a machine with  Xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm's this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste

Ethernet certainly has enough bandwidth for a few blinking cursors  My
Lisp Machine blinks the cursor twice a second and updates the time in the
status line every second  This uses under K bytessecond or about  of
the bandwidth of Ethernet  A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be
a problem but a couple dozen should be fine

Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem except over a wet string network
One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions and
hence process switches that it forces upon a host  Actual measurements
hourly average are  per second per logged in user which can lead to
 or more process switches depending on whether each event is
filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how
many processes are needed for each character

While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking
process and does not add any transactions it will add something like
 process switches per second per user  This is a significant increase
in overhead especially as the application may have quite a large working
set  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor there could be as many
as 

If you want to go there I wouldn't start from here

Hi

I've tried to get rid off XDM's ugly Login window by giving it a 'cool'
backgroundPixmap ressource As Login is derived from Core this should be
possible Anyway setting xloginbackgroundPixmapabcxpm did not
produce any message of the form 'cannot convert String to Pixmap' and
explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing too

Any way to do it

What are HyperHelp and Xprinter  Read on

Bristol Technology is proud to announce version  of
its popular HyperHelp product and version  of Xprinter

			    HyperHelp 
			    
HyperHelp is the defacto standard for online context
sensitive help in the Unix marketplace  Through a one
line function call application developers can access the
full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
their development time  HyperHelp can use the same RTF
project and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility
This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between MS Windows Motif and
Open Look  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker 
And with HyperHelp  Bristol introduces its SGML compiler

New features in HyperHelp  include secondary windowsa character
based viewer segmented bitmaps SGML support and an improved History
window

			     Xprinter 
			     
Xprinter  allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existingnew X based applications
very easily  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
display and printer  This lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing  Take a look at the source code for
our demo and see Xprinter in action

If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL support
to your application Xprinter is the tool for you  Earlier
this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for UNIX SVR


Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about
HyperHelp and Xprinter 

If you have any questions or comments send them to us at
infobristolcom or call us at  

				Happy demoing



					The staff at Bristol Technology

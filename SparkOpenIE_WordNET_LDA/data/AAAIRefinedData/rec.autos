  	I have been active in defending Saturn lately on the net and would
  like to state my full opinion on the subject rather than just reply to others'
  points
  	
  	The biggest problem some people seem to be having is that Saturn
  Dealers make K on a car  I think most will agree with me that the car is
  comparably priced with its competitors that is they aren't overpriced 
  compared to most cars in their class  I don't understand the point of 
  arguing over whether the dealer makes the K or not  
 
 I have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either
 The only thing that I can figure out is that people believe that if
 they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket
 expenses for the car While this may be true in some cases I do not
 believe that it is generally true I bought a Saturn SL in January of '
 AT THAT TIME based on studying car prices I decided that there was
 no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the Saturn Sure maybe I
 could have talked the price for some other car to the Saturn price but
 my outofpocket expenses wouldn't have been any different What's important
 to me is how much money I have left after I buy the car REDUCING DEALER PROFIT
 IS NOT THE SAME THING AS SAVING MONEY Show me how reducing dealer profit
 saves me money and I'll believe that it's important My experience has
 been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money
 
 Fred


Say you bought your Saturn at k with a dealer profit of k
If the dealer profit is  then you would only be paying k for
the same car  So isn't that saving money

Moreover if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by  
then their cars will be even better deals  Say if the price of a Saturn was
already  below market average for the class of cars then after they
reduce the dealer profit it would be  below market average  It will

 Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY
 
 Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive

Now not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even 
the buyers for other cars will pay less

Isn't that saving money

If you have put in a new unit in a similar car I'd like to hear

Please answer via Email

I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G
In consumer reports it is ranked high in many
catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars
Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord

A couple of things though
 In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this
   car I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's
 There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G fully
   loaded at dealer cost I have check this out and the numbers match
   up They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid
   version includes dual airbags and want to get rid of their old 's

I guess my question is Is this a good deal 
Also Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti

Thanks

Carl Hoffman

PS

The other cars that I have test driven and which are in the
running are
Mitsubishi Galant Honda Accord and Toyota Camary

Hi being new to a car owner I would pretty much like to know more about 
some basics of maintaining the cars

I know the following

 Oil has to be changed every  miles

Change the oil filter too

 Check tires before going on the high way And fill up the tank

Make that monthly or more often if you know one or more of your
tires has a slow leak

If the tire has a leak you should fix it 


What others Thank you


 Check ALL fluids regularly every month check the oil every time you
   fill up with gas

Doesn't work too well if the engine is hot its more accurate to check the
oil when the engine is cool ie not when you are at a gas station

      I'd like to add the Beretta GTZ as a car which will kick GSR butt
 anyday and it's a lot cheaper to boot

 I will take this one with a definate grain of salt  Performance data shows a

 If this poster has some proofother than my friend blew one away last week


     Want proof  Here is some data on acceleration and handling from
Motor Trend apr '

          Integra GSR     Beretta GTZ

                      
 mile            
L acc g's               
Slalom                   
WRONG
Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's slalom times they are  right
along with the Integra and the car does that with small  inch tires that
are all weather XGTV not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta
Your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine
Road  Track and Car Driver have the GSR at  to  for Road and Track
Also Quarter mile times vary from  to 
You can't tell exactly by the numbers  Furthermore the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end  Car  Driver and Road  track
have the GSR doing  to  mph and it gets there fast


     So the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep
up with it in acceleration  And the Beretta probably has a higher top
speed due to the horsepower advantage  hptorque for the
Integra vs  for the Beretta
You always believe those exact numbers why don't you drive a GSR and see
for your self while the GSR has a low  torqye its high gearing over a 
rpm make up for the difference still wouldn't call it a torque moster though

     The biggest advantage would have to be the price  The Integra costs
 as tested Motor Trend the GTZ costs  as tested  The
GTZ also has standard nicities and Airbag and Antilock brakes  An airbag
is not available on the Integra and lower models do not have ABS
Considering you save almost  dollars for the Beretta and the Quad
is a reliable engine it doesn't make sense to get the Integra as a
performance coupe which is what people have been trying to make it out
to be


Quad  reliable yeah what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsThe Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down You can rev that car all day everyday
and you'll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else I speak
from expierence
I'm not saying the Quad  is a bad engine but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine  AND while the Integra costs alot more it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time

NOTE this isn't a flame on the GTZ or other GM Quad  products  THe Berreta
is a nice car and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention it has an Airbag  But to start quoting figures from one
source isn't too reliable  Read other sources and drive both cars  While I
haven't driven a GTZ I have driven GTs and Grand Ams with Quad  engines
so they are similair

chrome bumpers ride height generally more power  The older cars are 
appreciating slowly  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the

This past winter I drove from NYC to KillingtonVT  or  times in my

with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires I put  Noika NRs on in Dec and have been 
sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since I've plowed through
   inch snow covered roads effortlessly while other cars have been paralyzed
front wheel drive included

Concentrate more on where the rubber meets the road rather than driveability of cars
in snowy conditions Drive carefully buy good snow tires and most cars will perform
adequately in less than ideal conditions

An aside 
I can't praise Noika NR snows enough Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have ever
driven on If you live in the snow belt do yourself a favor and get a set of these
next winter

Acura Infiniti Maxima Altima in which case you missed ones such
as Integra Supra Allante' Capri and Calibra  In Canada add Serenia and
Precidia  If you count misspellings add Protege and in Canada
Vigor  How about the forthcoming Mondeo if it is given that name
in North America

   Others might include Celica Corolla Paseo and Tercel  In Canada
add Asuna

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned They aren't really at

How about the Explorer Trooper Blazer Montero and if the budget

Bear in mind that  of all SUV's purchased never venture offroad
Carefully weigh the tradeoff between comfort and offroad performance
when choosing one and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the offroadability to sacrifice some of the
onroad comfort

How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the

extended warranty is worth itfor some people it is worth itothers not and
for some the peace of mind knowing you won't have too many unexpected expenses

apparently you're not a woman  my husband hates the auto door locks
features but forgets that besides families with children a woman
feels safer in a car that locks easily in addition to watching around
 checking out if anyone's near me when I get to my car  never park
in a secluded spot etc  have my keys ready to open the door so I'm
not fumbling in my purse looking for them 

This has me thinking  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
their keys in their pants pockets like men do  I have two pockets on the
back of each of my pants  I put my keys in one and wallent in another
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely
Everything is that much simpler for me  Why can't women do the same
Is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents

One of the local dealers has a used k miles ' Probe GT
on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the
window saying the dealership bought the car back from
the previous owner because of Engine noises but that
the Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those
noises were normal  I thought it was worth looking
into the car seems otherwise clean and mentioned this
to a coworker who proceeded to tell me a horror story
about her son's ' Probe GT which had several problems
ending with engine noises which she said was something
with the heads that Ford acknowledged the noise said
they were working on it but didn't have a cure as of
yet  Her son traded the car in and I checked  not
the same car  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring
problem with the V in the Probe GT's and by extension
with the Madza  and MX

Anything to this  I'd love to consider buying the GT I'm
turning   time for my scheduled mid life crisis 
but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner

It's great that all these other cars can outhandle outcorner and out
accelerate an Integra

But you've got to ask yourself one question do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade  No wimpy popup sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque  A moonroof that can be opened to the air
closed to let just light in or shaded so that nothing comes in

You've just got to know what's important

We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with WD and we have the
following questions All we would do is go skiing  no offroading

 With WD do we need the performance axle  limited slip axle
Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires
are on different terrain 

 Do we need the allterrain tires PX or will the
allseason PX be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe

Bottom line  I did it and it worked

In article Aprmichaelapplecom emsmichaelapplecom E Michael Smith writes
Does it take any peculiar tools to remove the rear springs from a Ford
F truck  This is a x with leaf springs front and rear

So with a big socket and an air wrench and a floor jack and a 
hydrolic bottle jack  can I do this at home  

I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks
And a can of WD helped

The sockets needed were metric exact fit but I was able to use
some SAE sockets   and  are rather close to  and mm
It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford 

I'm pictureing this  Undo U bolts  Put a bottle jack on the axle
and raise the bedframe to take stress off of the leaf spring  Undo
the end boltsbushings  Drop the spring  Turn the bottom leaf 
Reconnect the spring bolts

Sounds about right

Didn't have to undo the end boltsbushings  Just the  U bolts on
each side and the shock absorber  Jacking up the frame some more
had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden 
platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to
raise the frame  I't one TALLL truck lifted the spring
free of the axel  Taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together

The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end  No wrench head  Vice Grips worked fine
I soaked the nut with WD and it came right off

Flipped the bottom spring and then

Is this a nightmare waiting to happen or an easy though physically
demanding thing to do

Well it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a A 
OK well maybe it's not that easy but it's not terribly
difficult

I donno  I'm a little more sore today than after working on a
A 

A  foot pipe cheater was a real help  Torque spec for the U bolt
nuts is  to  ftlbs    A A doesn't have that kind of
torque spec 

It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack  
Squeeze pack with two hands hold bolt with third put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands   I used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment then I could let go
to get the nut wrench Vice Grips

Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too
until I discovered that the axel had  Tilted andor  rolled forward

One the drivers side a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole  On the passenger side I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about  inch to get things to line up  Spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block
with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a 
break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore since it HAD
been lined up before and I didn't move it something ELSE must 
have  hmmm axle no longer constrained not to move  hmmm move 
it back hmmm

After that it was all much easier to 'close up'

BTW the ride is now softer but not quite as soft as I was hoping for
At least it now sits level

The silly thing about this whole argument is that most of the trunk
releases I'm tempted to say all but there's bound to be a
counterexample only operate if the car is on ACC or running  Thus
you can't easily pop the trunk without starting the car

Most cars  The only cars I've ever seen with this feature have been
GM cars  My  Mazda ' Honda and coming soon ' Probe all have
cableoperated releases   My '
Camaro had an electric hatch release that was thankfully independent of
the key in the ignition the exception to the rule mentioned in my first
sentence

I should probably have said glovebox trunk releases  I haven't
encountered any glovebox releases that are cable operated  Numerous
GM and several FordMercury cars that I've encountered have electrical
releases in the glovebox and all of the ones I've seen needed the
ignition on to some degree to operate  Your Camaro example is noted
but since it's a hardtop it's not a big deal  I've never run into a
convertible with a cableoperated trunk release  I'd agree  that
in such an environment a cable or alwaysactive electrical release
would be rather stupid

jim frost
jimfcenterlinecom

My Honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key
The valet key can be left with someone and will NOT unlock the trunk
or enable the cable release

I remember my mothers ' Corvette that had an electronic hatch release
located on the drivers door which was ALWAYS active  The fact that the
car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to 
disable the hatch release unnecessary

 My friend brought a subaru SVX recently  I had drove it for couples times and I
think its a great car esp on snow  However when she took it to a local Subaru
dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about  dollars  The dealer
told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to
disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour
At first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto
but found out the they are charging roughly the same price  So is there any
SVX owner out there that has the same problem   And if the oil change story is
true then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me By the way the car
looks great

No Integra I have seen comes with allseason tires 
The GTZ does come with much bigger  wheels

along with the Integra and the car does that with small  inch tires that
Your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine
Road  Track and Car Driver have the GSR at  to  for Road and Track

The CD figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype
supplied by Acura The MT figures are more plausible

Also Quarter mile times vary from  to 
 sounds reasonable probably faster than regular Integras

     So the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep
up with it in acceleration  And the Beretta probably has a higher top
speed due to the horsepower advantage  hptorque for the
Integra vs  for the Beretta
You always believe those exact numbers why don't you drive a GSR and see

The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving It needs a  speed
box more than any other modern car Essentially th in a regualr Integra
equals th in the GSR and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed

rpm make up for the difference still wouldn't call it a torque moster though

Considering you save almost  dollars for the Beretta and the Quad
is a reliable engine it doesn't make sense to get the Integra as a

The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon It
was a piecve of junk but very quick for FWD

Quad  reliable yeah what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect

The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than k
miles a rare screw up by Honda
Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars The performance enthusiasts would take

Has anybody noticed that Toyota has an uncanny knack for designing horrible
ugly station wagons  Tercels Corollas Camrys  Have their designers no
aesthetic sense at all
 
The new Camry Wagon may just be even uglier than my Tercel   

toyota has cornered the market on ugly station wagons
after seeing the new camry sedan i had thought toyota would
finally turn out something nicelooking  the new camry station
wagon bears a strong resemblance to a hearse and a weird looking
one at that

Photo radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all Speeding is a moving 
violation committed by the operator not the owner The owner may be a 
rental agency a dealer a private party or a government agency As long
as the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegally
or unsafely the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator does
The car may even have been driven without the owner's knowledge or consent 
I can't believe a mailed ticket where the driver is not identified would 
stand up in court This is obviously a lazy cynical boneheaded fascist 
way to extort revenue and has nothing to do with public safety

What do photo radar units look like  Also what major US cities use it

 You will be surprised at the number of people who forget their glasses
 while driving  And then there are the people who just plain don't get
 their eyes checked once a year

As someone who has lousy vision I can see objects at a distance without
my glasses However they are quite fuzzy and I may not be able to make
out the details But I can certainly tell that SOMETHING is there


  I won't argue too much about anything  I am probably one of those that 
think that we can't have enough safety on the roads  I would gladly 
sacrifice distractions as you call it than someone having trouble seeing
danger earlier  One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of distractions
for me


  And then there is dawn and dusk  When your eyes have not yet adjusted
 to the poor light  And there are those who drive blackgrey cars And
 then there is the case where you are driving down a twoway one lane 
 road and someone is overtaking cars and coming the opposite direction 
 doesn't see you because your lights are not on Or vice versa  At mph 
 that is quite a small reaction time  But of course we are too macho to 
 think we are invincible and can react faster than that Only the poor 
 sod who you didn't see might not have a normal life ever

I worked out the reaction time in a previous post and its PLENTY even for
an  year old grandma as long as speeds are in the  MPH range or less
If you or some other driver is going way faster than that then be careful

As always you are responsible for your driving actions If you pull out to
pass and crash into someone for whatever reason its YOUR fault If you can't


   Problem is that I may just kill the guy I agree that I would be at fault
and I will have my license revoked why I might even go to the gas chamber
But the fact still remains that the guy is dead  Someone died because I
was too stingy to put on my lights 


see a damn thing then you shouldn't be driving  lights fail fallen trees
or rocks don't have lights etc  I maintain that headlight strength


   The ratio of the probability of fallen treesrocks on the roads to 
oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered  The difference is also
working on what we know could happen to what might happen


running lights are not necessary for motorists who drive around MPH It may
be a good idea to force the running or headlights on when you turn your
windshield wipers on but only because some people are too stupid to do so
If you crash into one of those idiots you have to fight it out in court to
show his neglegence if you can even prove it


  Just out of curiosity how much gasmilage do you loose when you put
 your lights on  And how much do you reduce the life of your headlamps
 And what is the cost of your headlamps anyway

Mileage is certainly reduced but by a very very small amount probably
about  watts for head and running lights This is an extra  horsepower
that must be made by the engine It may be that this will cost you around two 
gallons a year But times  million cars that's a lot of gas

  Compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those  million cars
it is miniscule 

  Whatever  'tis a pity I have to share the same roads with a person
not concerned with safety

S
ssaveolecdaccom


Lamp life is measured in hours So if you normally drive in half daylight and
half night your lamps will have to be replaced twice as often Headlamps
only cost about US for most halogen lamps

The cost to the individual is trivial and to me is not the issue What I
don't like is the distractions all these cars with headlights cause I don't
need to constantly see the headlights of the vehicle behind me I don't need
to see the headlights of every gosh darn car for a mile down the road These
lit up cars make nonilluminated things LESS visible like pedistrians and
bikes Hopefully we're not going to mandate DRL's for people and bikes 
too

A stream of taillights is tolerable as are the orange front running lights
This is certainly sufficient for other people to see you if they look and
doesn't distract me nearly as much as full power headlights

 This has me thinking  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
 their keys in their pants pockets like men do  I have two pockets on the
 back of each of my pants  I put my keys in one and wallent in another
 Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely
 Everything is that much simpler for me  Why can't women do the same
 Is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
 a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents 

Oh PULLEEZE

It's not biology at all it's clothing design  Women's clothing is
generally designed to be as nonfunctional as possible  It's only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in  Previously deep pockets were
virtually unknown in women's clothing  Skirts generally have better
pockets now too  Dresses espcially fancy dresses are still pretty
hopeless  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
dressed up to go out somewhere so I don't have to be encumbered by a
purse

If women consistently bought functional clothing and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures  There's
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional women's clothing  The manufactuing industry
lost millions

From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and
long legs and high waists than women's clothing without

In article foo Brad Thone CBTWUVMD writes
Well there is a difference

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy but oil viscosity in general
decreases with temperature  The SAE numbers are based on a typical'
curve that oils used to all have running from say the viscosity of a
roomtemperature weight at C down to say that of a roomtemperature 
weight at C for a typical weight oil

Oils that are designed for operation in normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a W' tacked on the end so in winter in a cold
place you'd stick W in your car in the winter and  in it in the summer
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year

Modern multiviscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature
As a result their viscosity graphs cross over several curves  A multivis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures a normal' operating
temperature and a cold' one though I can't remember the numbers

In any event the weights do indicate a significant difference  Remember
that your engine is temperatureregulated by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins most of the time  unless you overheat it or
something

Any weight of oil is better than no oil or than very old carbonized
oil  Thin oil won't in general lubricate as well at temperature
thicker oil will like a W will lubricate better at temperature 
but not as well during startup when most engine wear occurs  

If you're planning on making long drives the W is probably fine
esp in the summer in your W car  But if you're making short drives
stick to the W

No sorry your wrong again You quoted the del Sol as doing  in
 according to CD Interestingly the Stealth ES which is
faster than your RT does the samerun in  seconds according to
CD Kind of embarassing isn't it Why didn't you check the figures

before posting It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out
twice with your own figures

 that  second  for the Stealth

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an   Wonder why you couldn't find it

Do you realize that a k Sentra CD will run a  that a Sentra SER or Saturn
will run in the 's Don't you think it is kind of strange that your
hp sports car is so easily beaten 

A Mustang  which weights about the same according to your numbers
has less power and is much quicker Care to explain Don't be abusive
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those hp
went to its a mystery to me

 The Sentra SER really is alot quicker than the hp FWD Sports car

The reason I ask is because I went to a classic car meet here in the UK
and saw a very nice old De Soto 's vintage I'd guess with wooden
artillery type wheels etc but it was righthand drive I can't believe
that DeSoto produced RHD cars just for the UK

Well Sweden and Australia and lord knows wherever else used to drive on
the wrong side of the road so the export market might have been
larger then than just the UK

i'm guessing but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down
cattle trails and in wagon ruts  I am fairly sure that placement of the 
steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time

By the s there was a very active good roads movement which had
its origins actually in the s during the bicycle craze picked up
steam in the teens witness the Linclon Highway Association  or so
and the US highway support act real name something different in 
that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent
roads Also the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic
transport during WW  convinced the government that good raods were
crucial to our national defense  Anyway by the s there were plenty
of good roads at least around urban areas and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside  This was the era after all of the
first auto touring fad the motel the auto camp ground etc Two good
books on the subject spring to mind  Warren Belasco America on the
Road title may not be exact  author is and another called The Devil
Wagon in God's Country author I forget  Also any of John Flink's  or
John Bell Rae's auto histories

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary by the early
teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel
on the left  In the early days cars had the wheel on the left on the
right and even in the middle as well as sometimes having a tiller
instead of a wheel  This was standardized fairly early on though I
don't know why

  arguing over whether the dealer makes the K or not  
 
 I have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either
 The only thing that I can figure out is that people believe that if
 they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket
 expenses for the car While this may be true in some cases I do not
 believe that it is generally true I bought a Saturn SL in January of '
 AT THAT TIME based on studying car prices I decided that there was
 no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the Saturn Sure maybe I
 could have talked the price for some other car to the Saturn price but
 my outofpocket expenses wouldn't have been any different What's important
 to me is how much money I have left after I buy the car REDUCING DEALER PROFIT
 IS NOT THE SAME THING AS SAVING MONEY Show me how reducing dealer profit
 saves me money and I'll believe that it's important My experience has
 been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money
 
 Fred


Say you bought your Saturn at k with a dealer profit of k
If the dealer profit is  then you would only be paying k for
the same car  So isn't that saving money
	
	Yes  But the point is that prices are competetive  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a  profit but 
since a comperable Honda with  profit is more expensive it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn

Moreover if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by  
then their cars will be even better deals  Say if the price of a Saturn was
already  below market average for the class of cars then after they
reduce the dealer profit it would be  below market average  It will

 Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY
 
 Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive

Now not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even 
the buyers for other cars will pay less


	Not necessarily  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids who don't 
make a commision whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do make more  per hour or whatever  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision which IS taken out of per
car profits  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmenwomen

Isn't that saving money

	Maybe  Maybe not  Depends on accounting practices  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs

	I am the person who started out this subject

	To me the question really is not about dealer profit but the
	amount of money for the type of car I've settled with a
	new  Subaru Wagon with the similar amount of money a Saturn
	dealer asked for a SW OK I know it's a  model but I think
	I got a better car though I have to adjust my initial idea of 
	why I am getting a new car

	Today during a conversion with a friend I learned he rejected
	a Saturn for a Ford Tarurs as it only costed him a little bit more
	than a SL I may be wrong but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL

	I agree that a fullyloaded SL would come close in price to a
LOWEREND Ford Taurus  A FULLYLOADED Taurus on the other hand would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL  A fully loaded
SL would run somewhere around  while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the  range  A base Taurus GL I believe might
start around   Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push 
if you really try but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan  Your statement was not entirely faulty just a little
inaccurate


	I can't see Saturn is of better value and that is why I was puzzled
	by its pricings Oh we did not spend much time getting our deals
	being better informed has its advantages

Well that's ok  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some
of the other netters are  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that
is best for you  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by
the Impreza wagon so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones

	
	Then again I may be wrong

out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow not ice before I learned
this fact  I immediately bought XGT Hs which are definately allweather
A Carrera  I walk by everyday has XGT Vs on it even  The Michelin dealer
where I bought my new tires said the Vs were made out of a different

The SL does  in about  note that this is closer to a  than

comparison I know but the point is that Saturns and highend Civics
for that matter accelerate just fine in fact better than most
unimproved muscle cars of the s  hp is great but tied to 
tons it just doesn't go that quick Saturns on the other hand use 
hp tied to  lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the

While your  time is consistent with most car magazines and reports I saw
the PBS MotorWeek show clock a speed SL at  seconds  I'm sure that most
SL owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed but  seconds is still
astonishingly fast for a small door  A new Civic EX runs about  seconds
 if I'm not mistaken  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the
second range

Sweden changed in  The way I heard it was that they swapped
all the traffic signs around one Sunday

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well We changed
side  or SEP I don't remeber the exactly time but
it was in the night in the 'big' cities like Stockholm  Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden exept busses and taxis during the whole
weekend The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow

The year after Iceland also changed

About cars Before the Hday H as in Hoegertrafik hoeger is
Swedish and stands for 'right' practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side' At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side 

More contries that uses the left side is

Japan
Tanzania I think
New Zeeland
How about South Africa

BTW Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments

I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shithead Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes' This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car

Not sure how long the small shitbox Volvos last  too damn long The worst car I ever drove was a hired  In power handling and ride it was reminiscent of something

I am interested to find out if there is any domestic car manufacturer
especially GM and FORD which produces bulletproof luxury sedans

I understand Caddy is working on one double battery super high perf
engine more gauges a bit 'stretched' etc lots of communication equipment
the works Color selection is limited though 

The problem is that the guy at  Penn Avenue is about to get it
Pres Clinton Last time it was a Lincoln this time a Caddy 

I am just wondering if this socalled bulletproof perhaps reinforced
windows special materials for the bodyengineetc luxury car  Lincoln
and Cadillac models  is readily available to the public  

Not to my knowledge I know GM does conversion work for things like 
hot climates ie the Chevy Caprices sold to the Middle East but 
things like that are always done by third parties NOT the manufacturer
Maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefedup everything
perhaps the police cruiser package on the CapriceCrown Vic and start from
there 

Do we have
to go through any special dealership to obtain these cars  I would really
like to hear from anyone who has experience with the bulletproof cars

And I wuz drivin' along in my armored Seville STS and this punk pulls out
of nowhere with an RPG Rocket Propelled Grenade but the bulletproof
windshield stopped him  Don't think many people on the net have a need
for bulletproof cars 

Check with local armored service companiessecuritybodyguard places They'd
know best I think your average luxury car dealer will have a coronary if
you told them I'll take the blue Caprice with options FZ Fuzzy Dice
PR power everything and AR Armor 

Any information regarding the dealers and aftermarket shops that have
bulletproof Lincoln's and Cadillac's is greatly appreciated  You may
email me at chsumtlmitedu or post the message in this newsgroup if
you believe other netters might be interested as well  BTW same information
on MercedesBenz BMW Lexus and Infiniti luxury sedans is needed
as well if you have it

I believe an article on the conversion process appeared in the car press within
the last few months

No At six years you are nearing the end of the design life of the
vehicle when everything should be breaking At that point the
driving habits make more difference than the actual reliability
of the vehicle so the data becomes unreliable for drawing conclusions

Bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months not  years

If that were not the case everyone would be driving fleet rental resolds

And while you are considering things factors in stat terms how about
city vs highway driving ratios owner vs dealer service extreme weather
or environment adherence sp to maintenance schedules whether the car
has ever been in an accident number of different drivers of the same car
in a family whether the car is garaged warmed up

Cup holders driving is an importantant enough undertaking

This is a good idea  so you can carry your nonalcoholic drinks without
spilling or having someone hold on to them

I agree  Six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me
thirsty especially for something with caffeine  I consider it a
failing of my car that it has no cup holder nor anywhere to put a cup
holder

 Turbo in UK was good for mph Useful for blowing away VW Beetles though I
believe the Beetle corners better 

I can say without any doubt that I have never been blown away by any Volvo ever
I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shithead Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes' This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car

Not sure how long the small shitbox Volvos last  too damn long The worst car I ever drove was a hired  In power handling and ride it was reminiscent of something
from the s without the character The  only ceased production a couple of years back I've only been a passenger in the big Volvos but that was enough I ought to go
for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts


Oh well I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of
Volvo's is their marketing It looks like Volvo uses something like
Do you dare to risk your family in any car attitude which is quite
annoying in the long run

But now Volvo has produced a new  good car the Volvo  Front drive
 L  valves motor completely new chassis etc Even the British magazine
CAR liked it and believe me that is quite much for a Volvo And
the American magazine Road  Track said that This is not your uncle
Olof's car and in a positive sense

But in any case I'd still like to own the  estate Strong tanklike
chassis L inline six rear drive  

BTW the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar
drivers    

What You mean what I drive A cheapo Japanese a Toyota of course
I do not have money for a car like BMW Merc Jaguar Saab  
Volvo  or  etc
If I had the money I would have bad problems deciding which one
to buy

 Q  What is Ka band radar  Where is it used  Should a radar detector be
     able to handle it 
 
 A  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
     in socalled photoradar installations  In these installations a
     lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a  degree angle to the
     direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit
     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle  Because of the low
     power and the  degree angle many people believe that a radar
     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit
     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
     capability anyway  The number of locales where photoradar is in use
     is limited and some question the legality of such units  Best advice
     learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they
     are used or else don't speed

Photo radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all Speeding is a moving 
violation committed by the operator not the owner The owner may be a 
rental agency a dealer a private party or a government agency As long
as the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegally
or unsafely the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator does
The car may even have been driven without the owner's knowledge or consent 
I can't believe a mailed ticket where the driver is not identified would 
stand up in court This is obviously a lazy cynical boneheaded fascist 
way to extort revenue and has nothing to do with public safety

 BK



We had those fg photoradar things here in Sweden a while ago
There was a lot of fuzz about them and a lot of sabotage too a spraycan
with touchup paint can do a lot of good

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of courtcases
where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
of speeding

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a carthief that
had stolen a car and made false plates He ofcourse chose a license number
of a identical car so the photo seemed correct

In conclosion Photoradar sucks every way you look at it

  Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm  installed  
Comes with glass break sensor motion detector and shock detector  Does 
anyone have one of these alarms  Are they any good  From the looks of it its
about the best on the market for the price  It's also on sale so that's 
another reason to get it  I think I'll be saving almost   Any opinions

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum  not to mention price range
How about the Explorer Trooper Blazer Montero and if the budget
allows the Land Cruiser 
 
Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser My local Toyota dealer says they
get two a year and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list
Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires
And if they are that rare I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on
hand

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shitload of power and room
Fully stocked it cost   I think it is worth the money
Only problem is when you get into accidentit doesn't usually break down
unless you forget to get a oil change for  miles or something
stupid like this body parts and other parts are very hard to locate 
Parts are over priced also  One of my friend had accident in past snow
storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender

Well if you test drive Land Cruiser all other SUV look like toys
One of magazine writer called it Land Bruiser  

If you have  to spare for SUV get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover

Apologies if this is a FAQ is there a FAQ posting for this group I
am an infrequent reader of recautos so I can't remember

I am in the market for a used Chevy Suburban and have observed that
prices for models with diesel engines run about  less than
comparable models with a gas engine

There has to be a reason for this

Yes there is  consumer confusion  In the early 's with the
fuel crisis etc everyone wanted better fuel mileage  Diesel fuel
was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines  So GM decided to conver their
 gas engine into a diesel engine I think was a  liter  Big
mistake  The engine was not redesigned but converted  The engine
could not handle the higher compression etc  Lots of problems with
these cars  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer 
DONT BUY A DIESEL  THEY ARE BAD  This was a gross generalization

Ask yourself this question  if your livelihood depended on driving
LOTS of it would you use a dependable or undependable but cheaper
in the short run vehicle  What do Greyhound busses have in them
Trailer Trucks  Even Train Locomotives  Are these gasoline engines
No they are diesel  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a
 mile warrantee with they vehicles

I own an  Diesel Suburban  The L diesel is a GREAT engine
Just keeps going  It was more expensive when new than the gasoline
engine vehicle was  The only problem with diesel engines is that 
when they need to be rebuilt they are expensive  In a gas 
engine you will pay about  for a rebuild  Diesel L is about
  But then again the diesel engine lasts about twice as long
and gets about  better mileage  A carburator for a gasoline engine
costs about  to rebuild or less  A rebuild of the fuel injection
pump on a diesel will cost about  or more  But then again
you never need a tuneup

If you're looking at a rebuilt L I'd say you got a great deal
Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also

Good luck

A fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner
and sending you on your merry way  poorer  Go to KMart and buy the

Just because you dealer sez you need it don't mean it's necessarily so

This has me thinking  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
their keys in their pants pockets like men do  I have two pockets on the
back of each of my pants  I put my keys in one and wallent in another
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely
Everything is that much simpler for me  Why can't women do the same
Is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents 

I've found that it has to do with the way women's clothes are made
If you put keys in the front pocket of women's jeans or slacks you
get a bulge that also tends to make it impossible to sit down because
they stick you constantly  ditto in the back pocket

Also try looking at the back pockets of women's jeans and compare
them to the back pockets on men's jeans  They are usually if you buy
jeans that you expect to last for any length of time about half the
size  There flat out isn't room for a wallet or a bunch of keys

Besides which where would men put all their crap if their wives
didn't carry purses 

The same place single men do wallet in back pocket comb in other
back pocket keys in front pocket knive in other from pocket pen
in shirt pocket or front pants pocket  Or do married men start
carrying around a bunch of stuff to keep there women happy

This should not be the case if they are at all reputable Fuel injector 
cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is
hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure The car is actually run on
the solvent during the cleaning process The equipment to properly do this is
pricey and generally not something the average home mechanic has The solvent
itself is not very expensive  and you could probably make up a hose to
fit your system and do it yourself but I didn't tell you that 

Not many intank cleaners are worth wasting your money on There has been a 
discussion of these products on here from time to time and Chevron Techron
not ProGard with Techron is generally regarded as the best It is however
a bit more than  a bottle IMHO it will not substitute for proper
injector cleaning if they are really crudded up You'll have to decide if the
 price is a better deal than spending your time andor buying equipment to
do it

 JJ SHO of this vintage Anything I should specifically ask abt  
 JJ Brakes cluthch etc  I noticed on the drive the clutch engagemen
 JJ point seemed a little high since all my other cars are autotragics
 JJ I'm not sure abt this point I had my foot firmly planted on the
 JJ brake when I started it up There was a bit of a pop in the pedal
 JJ soon after the engine started This also occured on a few Tbird SC'
 JJ I test drove Was this the ABS self test
 
Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things  There has been a clutch 
replacement program you might check to see if the car is still eligible 
as it is a change well worth making  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter also a change worth making but that'll 
cost you some 

My brakes usually do one wibblewobble on startup so that is probably 
normal  Didn't know they had a selftest that's interesting

What kind of tires does the car have on it


  WinQwk b  For a good time dial  on your SHO

I don't understand the fascination with vent windows They create a tremendous

speeds above mph The current flowthrouh ventilation if designed right 
are far more superior

HELP my car insurance has been cancelled for the second time in a row
I still haven't gotten in touch with my agent from AAA because she's
out for the week but my mom said that I got a call saying that my insurance
was going to be cancelled because of an accident  not even a fenderbender 
that was never declared or anything Besides the fact that i have no idea how they found out about this the only
other thing that could bug them is that I have  ticket but I told them
about it and they said that it wasn't a problem
If I go to another insurance I know I will end up paying more bc I already
shopped around for this one and I can't afford to pay for the insurance
especially since I still haven't gotten the  the two insuance companies
are supposed to refund me I just got a new Saturn SL and can't afford the
car payments and the insurance but I bought the car having gotten a QUOTE
from State Farm which they later went back on 
PLEASE HELP ME what legal rights do I have Can I make State Farm who originally 
gave me the quote give me that rate they made a mistake after I signed all
the papers I did not give any false evidence How can I get my money back
for the car if I can't pay for the insurance I'm deperate

	I just went through this mess in New Jersey I'm still waiting for a
refund as well namely that the original company made a mistake and left me
in the lurch  My recourse was through NJ's insurance dept Office of Consumer

I know it's a long shot but maybe someone went through this and will have
some comments to share

The story is this I bought a car out of state and I'm trying to get
the safety inspection in Pennsylvania The problem is that the car has 
aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield The tint is rather
weak and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint

The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a
waiver from the state police So I went to the state police  the
officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal and I can get a
waiver only for a pre car or for a medical reason I asked him to
show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal  He
showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint if
you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint When I told
him that you can in fact see the inside very well he shut the book
and said It's just illegal and in fact we can have someone give you
a ticket for it right now Well won't argue with that

Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the
tint I'd like to keep it I'll reread the vehicle code in the
library  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police
that says it's OK so I can get the inspection and so that I won't
get in trouble for the tint later on I also wouldn't mind registering
a complaint against that officer  he really pissed me off

So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from
the police especially in Pennsylvania Does anyone have any experience
registering a complaint against an officer I called the station 
later on today but they basically said there is no place where I
could register a complaint against an officer And if I do decide
to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway how much of a chance do
I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court

Any comments about it will be welcome

Michal

No one should EVER rely on just a magazine to determine what car they
buy I don't care what magazine Btw I subscribe to three other 
auto rags I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men
from hell who think real men should read    

Statements like what you said above have no meaning People keep on
saying CU is only good for dishwashing detergent or as you
saidRelying on Consumer Reports     is like    and that is
all they say 

If there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there
would be some real content

Quad  reliable yeah what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsThe Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down You can rev that car all day everyday
and you'll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else I speak
from expierence
I'm not saying the Quad  is a bad engine but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine  AND while the Integra costs alot more it is a

a couple of things  blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability and 
while it is true that quad's have a problem with head gasket leaks that was
a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected  also i know pontiac is
replacing head gaskets that leak for free for yeark miles  other than
that i have found my quad to be completely solid and the direct ignition 
system means no wiresrotorrotorcap to ever deal with  also hydrolic lifters
mean no valve adjustments ever  i'm not badmouthing the integra engine i just
think you are going overboard on slamming the quad  you are quite correct
that the integra engine is quieter although i would not say smoother my
quad loves to rev especially at the highend  do you have any evidence
of blocks cracking on quads  i have not heard of this

In your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning
will do much more good than just using detergent gas   While I
agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged
do they get and is  a good price or can I do it myself by buying
a can of  what and doing  what


A fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner
and sending you on your merry way  poorer  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for 

Personally i wouldn't use the  product from KMart I knew about
this previously but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss 
their resident tech type discussed these products and recommends
not using them ie the nonisopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners

Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture
from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors  And although the 
others ethyl based do clean injectors they also cause rubber 
components in the fuel system to deteriorate and they don't mix well
with water to help remove it from the fuel system

I use a product recommended by VW called K by BG Products Inc
It cost more about  but it is supposed to do the job without
the potential harmful side effects and its results are supposed to 
last from k to k miles I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene sp

I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either since i 
only use these product as a preventative maintenance item

 
Just because you dealer sez you need it don't mean it's necessarily so
Be suspicious

  My friend brought a subaru SVX recently  I had drove it for couples times and I
 think its a great car esp on snow  However when she took it to a local Subaru
 dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about  dollars  The dealer
 told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to
 disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour
 At first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto
 but found out the they are charging roughly the same price  So is there any
 SVX owner out there that has the same problem   And if the oil change story is
 true then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me By the way the car
 looks great
 

Labour prices for car service are very expensive in Toronto compared to other
parts of Ontario  For example there are places in Ottawa that still charge
only hour  I've seen a couple of places charging hour  The cheapest
I've heard in Toronto is hour

If you're planning on making long drives the W is probably fine

stick to the W

Several years ago GM was having trouble with the rings sticking on the

not honor warranty work if W was used if my memory serves me
  or   was OK'd though

 apparently you're not a woman  my husband hates the auto door locks
 features but forgets that besides families with children a woman
 feels safer in a car that locks easily in addition to watching around
  checking out if anyone's near me when I get to my car  never park
 in a secluded spot etc  have my keys ready to open the door so I'm
 not fumbling in my purse looking for them 
 
 This has me thinking  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
 their keys in their pants pockets like men do  I have two pockets on the
 back of each of my pants  I put my keys in one and wallent in another
 Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely
 Everything is that much simpler for me  Why can't women do the same
 Is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
 a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents 

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most when they do are too
shallow to use

I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when
she goes from building to a car It is protect herself from
would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who
as a definite place of safty ie a locked car

Puting keys and walet looks ugly It breaks the lines and makes
you rear look wide as a cows

 Also to have the habits that
work for any clothing situation the pruse functions no mater
what you are wearing even nude or a bikni

A women's suit coat is lucky to have  pockets  on the outside
none on the inside I have men's coats that have as much as 
pockets This is definitally not fair

As one that wears both men's and women's clothes I can tell you
women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets

When dressed as a man I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and
my keys in a coat outside pocket It is much more covenent
than the pants pockets and looks better

Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is
paramout to a woman's safty Men don't see this as a problem
A woman is aware of this every time she goes out ie
Image some red necks yelling at you We are going to FUCK YOU
and the out weight you by  lbs and have  inches in hight
on you

If you want to find out why a women does something LIVE AS ONE

Moreover if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by  
then their cars will be even better deals  Say if the price of a Saturn was
already  below market average for the class of cars then after they
reduce the dealer profit it would be  below market average  It will

 Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY

 Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive

but what is Saturn's motivation here  they're already selling every
car they make with multiple shifts in the plant  given this what
possible motivation could they have to lower prices

ok how about this to argue about  why does the sl have a much lower base
price than the sc  it's over k cheaperi forget the exact amount
doesn't it cost more to have the extra doorswindowslocksmotors etc that 
are in the  door  perhaps it is just a marketing dealpeople want the
door so they will pay the extra k

Ok here's what I understand

The SLSLSLSWSW was meant to compete with the following cars

Honda Civic
Toyota Tercel SLSL
Toyota Corolla SLSL
Nissan Sentra
Mazda Protoge'
Subaru LoyaleImpreza
Isuzu Stylus
Geo Prizm
Ford Escort
Mercury Tracer
Mistubishi Mirage
PlymouthDodge Colt


Their core competition is the Civic Corolla and Sentra  Most of the other
models are in the same class but aren't the first cars you would think of
I threw in the EscortTracer because it has a good amount of Japanese
technology and has similar reliability stats  I didn't include domestic small
cars such as the Cavalier Sunbird Shadow Sundance Tempo and Topaz since I
think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese
roots

The SCSC was meant to compete against the following cars

Toyota Paseo
Honda Civic SiCivic Coupesdel Sol Si
Nissan NXNX
Mazda MX
Isuzu Impulse
Geo Storm
Ford Escort GT


If you look at the prices of these cars they're more expensive than they're
door counterparts  The is good reason for this  It is a more upscale and
trenddriven market  Even though many of these models are based on sedan
platforms their interior etc is good enough to warrant slightly higher
prices  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of

Tercel  Paseo
Sentra  NXNX
Civic  del Sol
  MX not sure on this one
Stylus  ImpulseStorm

To illustrate a Tercel starts at around  while the Paseo starts at
around   Even a door Tercel will cost less than a door Paseo  Now
you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some doors
offer  What I mean is that there is no dr Tercel with a comparable
powerplant as its sport coupe derivative  Let's take another example the
Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XSStorm GSi  Both have the same powerplants a
L hp engine but the smaller dr coupes are generally more expensive
Again this is because the twodoor sport coupe market is a more
fashionoriented and trendsetting segment  People are willing to pay more
money for this type of car  


In short even though the SCSC may be smaller hence less car it's market
orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent
sedan SLSL version

I hope this clears things up a bit

In a previous article dhqandrewcmuedu Daniel U Holbrook says

i'm guessing but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down
cattle trails and in wagon ruts  I am fairly sure that placement of the 
steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time

By the s there was a very active good roads movement which had
its origins actually in the s during the bicycle craze picked up
steam in the teens witness the Linclon Highway Association  or so
and the US highway support act real name something different in 
that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent
roads Also the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic
transport during WW  convinced the government that good raods were
crucial to our national defense  Anyway by the s there were plenty
of good roads at least around urban areas and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside  This was the era after all of the
first auto touring fad the motel the auto camp ground etc Two good
books on the subject spring to mind  Warren Belasco America on the
Road title may not be exact  author is and another called The Devil
Wagon in God's Country author I forget  Also any of John Flink's  or
John Bell Rae's auto histories

i'm sorry as i have never heard of any of this  Guess they don't think
it's important enough for a classroom and i was going on what i've seen
in picssome moviesreal nice scource there huh  I just always 
recall thinking that GOOD roads of asphalt didn't come around til the
Interstate Hiway Act or whatever they called it's and that wood and
cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression except in
overpopulated places like England and US cities  Obviously netwisdom
says i am wrong

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary by the early
teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel
on the left  In the early days cars had the wheel on the left on the
right and even in the middle as well as sometimes having a tiller
instead of a wheel  This was standardized fairly early on though I
don't know why

i knew it was almost always done but i knew of no reason that it might not
be done the other way by DeSoto for their car  Seems like they had some
other deviations from the norm too at times

NONONONO
If you do so you are putting the lives of others on the road at consider
able risk  Why do you think mechanics are ASE certified  Anyway you put
it you need those fancy scmancy gadgets

Awww right you want all the home mechanics lined up against a wall and
shot eh

Bull Pucky you chicken Read the service manual and get your head out of the
sand Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment
rack that do the job as competently albeit not as swiftly if not
more accurate due to the natural pride an ownermechanic places on his work
You can do an acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and
some imaginative work that would never have the effect of endangering
anyones life The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly well
you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able
to steer the car raise your hands those that think their vision is
so poor that they would screw up this badly

I bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall
with sand paper will kill millions of people It aint magic Go take the
certification course and look at the people that have never learned to add
in their whole life that are taking the certification

BTW I am disgusted at the Colt and some of the other Chrysler offerings
because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them My ' Chrysler
Laser Similar to the Daytona a reskinned Colt needed a realignment every
 months  Bolt a good grade ' x to each wheel using a carefully welded
spacer jig Measure toe in adjust to manufacturer specs Camber a bit more
difficult to adjust and measure  I used a micrometer to measure the
space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on
upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel hard to explain
This same tool could be used instead of the xs  I had made these tools up
right after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that
the original poster might not

  Mph speedos  esp the electronic ones

 The digital dash of the  cougars with the large analog clock in
 the middle of the dash  everything was digital except the stinking clock

  The funny thing about the digital dash  Tbird with the mph speedo 
limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would 
read all the way up to kph  At this point the stock anemic  would get 
short of breath  This of course was equivalent to about mph heheI bet 
I really coulda confused this thing if I'd toyed with the engine and rolled
the stupid thing the digits were limited to  

  I've gotta agree with ya on the analog clock wdigital dash though  My
girlfriend had a ' TurboCoupe with a digital clock and analog gaugesradio

 I love the keyless entry on my TBird it's great for those times that
 I had to stop to put air in my tires I could get out and lock the door
 with the engine running while I ran around to air up the tire It also

  I had a great feature on my Tbird  I could pull the key out and 
leave the ignition on  This scared the hell out of me the first time it
happened but I kinda grew to like it  Musta been a bad key copy or 
something

that use frequencies shared with police radar i forget which band
these will set off your radar detector if you get close enough though

BTW railroad police sometimes use radar to check for speeding trains

Tighten the bolt to the specified torque in your service manual  That
way it won't leak strip break etc hopefully  

Thank you very much in advance  Winson

You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in
place of the bolt  I have one on both of my cars  There have been no

 I agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might
 not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you don't want to
 give them that one carlength when they should just wait like you are
 BUT if you're one of those people that just sit's behind the person and
 doesn't flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or
 ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to 
 go by and you're not just drafting them then get the hell out of the 
 way of someone who will  I especially hate it when you flash someone at
 the back of a line and they don't 'pass it on'  
 And there's also the issue of some cars being more intimidating to get 
 people out of the way than others  For instance '' GTs look 
 pretty mean in a rearview mirror at night with the foglights on  
 There have been plenty of times when I've broken up a pack that a 
 secondinline hyundai has been behind for miles  You just need to
 know how to get their attention


I'd like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers If they see you
they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle
finger extended Because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane
ahead

  A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received
 In short
     The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign Given the conditions
   I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the
   intersection I would complete my rightturn and avoid a possible accident
   A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left
   and gave me the ticket
     The officer said The only reason that you even slowed down in the first
   place was that you saw me approaching otherwise you would have bombed right
   through


  I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for
 help To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine
 PHGHGHGHGH

 The judge sided with me and decided that in this case Not stopping was the
 safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY

  The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time very
  slippery backed by newpaper weather conditions were the factors what made
  the judge decide on his verdict


  Moral If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case
	 go for it It is a very interesting process and it is there for
	 your benefit Exercise your rights

I had exactly the same problem with a  Horizon  Third gear would
just disengage  Engine would rev up  Kind of disconcerting

I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny
sticks with me  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer
could not fix  If the lemon law had been in place then that car
would have been covered

I have had several Jap cars since then figuring the Horizon was my
contribution to the American Auto Companies and have never seen any
bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of
clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try

Anyway from that day forward I have sworn that I would never
purchase another American car with a standard  American manufacturers
don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and
have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars
However I hate automatics so I am still buying Jap cars

Not sure this is any help but other cars do this too

This makes senseradar pointed down because almost every train I pass headon that triggers
my radar detector does so more just after I have passed the front of the engine

I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer  The
design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat
ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM  The idea was to make the circuit
difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM  The
secondary purpose acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint
of practicality was to distributed the writes so as to avoid
exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used
The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect
at a rate any higher than  MPH so as to make spoofing the reading
by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable  This was for an
automobile that was not expected to ever exceed  MPH in
operation  The case of course might not be the same for your
 RX

The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions
under which cars have been operated  Since steering angle and
velocity data etc is available it would not be difficult to
collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the
drivers' use of the car  I am not aware of any manufacturer
currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading
out use data from the ECM  While it could be a potential invasion
of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your
driving style it could also provide valuable information from
actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars
I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving
demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion

Howdy

I'm a little new to this newsgroup but I would like to tap some of the
knowledge and expertise available here

The Subject  Aftermarket cruise controls

The Background
I recently broke my ankle in a roadbicycling accident  places five 
screws yuk    In two weeks I will be returning to Texas my
home from my school BYU in Provo Utah  As you can imagine trying to
drive nearly  miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of
a good time  My car does not have a cruise control so I would have to do
all the pedalling ha ha with my messedup ankle

My question
What is the general opinion of aftermarket cruise control units  I
realize that a cheap CC cruise control from say Pep Boys isn't going to
be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a
thing  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of
accuracy looks and that sort of thing  But anything's gotta be better than
trying to drive with a hosed ankle

I have a  Jeep Cherokee  speed standard  L engine with
ketteringsp ignition y'know distributor cap rotor that setupnot
electronic  Maybe you could've guessed it being an ' but I'm just trying
to give information as completly as I can

I found a CC unit for  bucks  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system 
instead of an electric servormotor  Is this good or bad  If I did buy
this CC which vacuum hose should I tap

It has two speed sensors  One magnetic and one that gets a signal from the 
negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pickup or so I
understand  I can use either one  Which is best  The manual says I read
it in the store today that the magneticaxle setup is more accurate but
harder to install  Is there really a big difference

It has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other CCs but does NOT have a
sensor for the clutch pedal  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I
might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up  Which
would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned 
the thing off  I'm pretty coordinated so this doesn't bother me if it
were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but I'm ok with it

The installation also calls for an attachment to a steadyon brake signal
and a switchedon brake signal  I think I can get a switched brake signal
from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse  Am I right  But I'm
not sure where to get the steadyon brake signal or for that matter what
exactly it is  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get
it

I think I can figure the other things out  Like how to hookup the negative
side tachtype sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and
all that miscellaneous business  But I need a little help with

	  Is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a
	    device
	  Is there any particularly good aftermarket CC
	  Are professionally installed CCs signifacantly better and
	    worth the cabbage
	  If the unit I saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just
	    that it is at Pep Boy and its  is sufficient for my simple 
	    needs how do I get the thing installed properly specifically
	    the questions above

My father and I built a Veep Volkswagen powered Jeep CJA when I was in
high school so I consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and
cars  So the installation doesn't scare me  I just want to be certain that
I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more
complicated than my Veep 

I appreciate your time in reading my post and I would appreciate any
expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject  If you would like to share
some of your wisdom please email as I don't get over this group very often
but I check my mail all the time

Again thanks for any help anyone may have

whips and their tempers Initially all cars were built with the driver's
controls on the right because that's the way people drove buggies so the

This is just not so  many of the earliest cars had their steering
controls in the center of the vehicle and there is no discernible
pattern of left or righthand steering controls until a few years into
the th century when in America at least lefthand wheels became the
pattern The mule team or horses I imagine explanation however
seems to have some merit

      Consumers report did a study I think and found that most
trucks got worse mileage with the tailgate off The tailgates on the
newer trucks actually help

oh sure they do  and replacing the front bumper and grille with a closet
door helps mileage and cooling  if CR actually said that then they have
bigger fools working for them than the fools that believe their drivel  but
who am I to argue this  just someone that's been a pickupdriver for 
years that's all  forget the 'net' just take off the tailgate on hiway trips
since the nets aren't designed to nor capable of restraining a load in the bed
anyway  around town the tailgate will have a negligable effect on mileage
anyway

Walt K

They may help to improve mileage in some cases I believe With the tailgate
on the flow structure behind the cab may differ and the vortex drag may be
reduced during high speed driving

How about those toneau covers I've been thinking of building one
from chipboard for roadtrips Any comment on how they affect
mileage in highway travel

I have a  chevy sprint with ac and doors It's odometer turned k
and the sensor light started blinking I went to the dealer and he said
it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor He
said It is to be changed every k but since I bought the car when it
had k I don't know if the same thing happened at k and k  He
quoted  for the part and  to install it The part cost 
outside but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor
is placed too deep in the engine parts He suggested I wait till it
malfunctions before I do anything  If anyone out there owns a chevy
sprint I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed Also
did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help Also
what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction 
  Any help would be greatly apprecisted
   Thanks

 After too many years of school I'm finally graduating and getting a real

 I was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around
 k on a sports car of some kind  After thinking about it I may have a
 better idea  I'll keep the Accord until it drops and buy the car I've
 always wanted  a Corvette Stingray My reasoning is that  accord
  corvette  is less than what I would spend anyway
 
 Basically I'm thinking of a late 's early 's for around k
 My question is what are good years to consider for reliability looks
 horsepower  in that order believe it or not horsepower is not a main
 concern if I want to go fast I get on my motorcycle and what are
 good prices
 
 Also what would insurance look like  I'm male single  I might
 wait until I'm  to get the car  lower insurance Would the fact that
 I mainly drive the other car lower it  Is there some type of classic
 car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under k miles
 per year
 
     My dad has a  vette and its on what you say 'classic insurance'
     Basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving
     time which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would
     probably suit your needs for limited mileage
  


In addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also require
that the vehicle be garaged when not in use

You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in
place of the bolt  I have one on both of my cars  There have been no
leaks in  miles combined miles on both cars

Yes but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot

all they have to do is reach underneath turn a valve and forget the trip 
home
But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them

I personally recommend installing a 'special' locking drain plug to keep
vandals away

 and out of curiosity I slowed to  to get a better look  Just as I
 passed from underneath the trestle my radar detector went into full 
 alert  all lights lit and all chirps beeps and buzzes going strong
 I thought I had been nailed good but no police materialized
 
 Could this have been caused by the train's radio or what
 


I don't know about trains but I've saw a sign on the back of a
Greyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off
It doesn't explain why but it does set off my radar detector

Do you have a Ziebart dealer in your area They've offered spray
on bed liners around here for several years If you do see what
kind of a warranty they have  Unfortunately I don't know anyone
who has gotten one so I can't help you there Also ask if they
can give you a list of references

     experience with Jeep service dept 

While not exactly a service incident I had a similar experience recently  
when I bought a new truck

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  
agreed on a price I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck  
When I returned I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  
get to me When I finally got in there everything went smoothly until he  
started adding up the numbers He then discovered that they had  
miscalculated the tax  license by about  He then said he needed  
another  from me I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  
their problem I wasn't giving them any more money The finance guy then  
brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time I  
reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  
treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  
deal He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it  
snatched back my check and left Needless to say they were not pleased by  
the turn of events

Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  
to know what happened I related the story and he apologised profusely and  
asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind I told him  
that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it  
that there were other dealers in town I was a repeat customer of theirs  
and that they should learn how to treat customersetcetcI was still  
pretty steamed about the whole affair He gave me the line about hating to  
lose a customer and they would try to find a solution etc etc I told  
him not to bother thanks I'd go somewhere else

A couple hours later the owner of the dealership called me all  
apologetic etc etc etc and said that they would cover the  plus  
knock another  off the price of the truck I told him I'd think about  
it and he gave me his private direct phone number his secretary's name  
and assured me that they valued me as a customer etc etc etc

I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  
decided what the hellthat was a pretty decent deal so I called him  
back and accepted his offer When I went back the next day to pick up the  
truck I received the royal treatment Everyone seemed to know about the  
incident even the lot boy Everything went smoothly and I was out of  
there in my new truck in about  mins

So I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer However it should not  
have happened in the first place I was a bit shocked to have a sales  
person talk to me like that I don't expect them to bow and grovel but I  
sure don't expect to be given a hard time either esp when it's their  
mistake

Anyway I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  
dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee  
I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer tho

 This reminds me of the first time my cousin did an oil change on his
car He crawled under removed a bolt drained the fluid replaced the
bolt then carefully poured in  quarts of oil Didn't bother to
check the dip stick just drove off Didn't get too far till me found
out that he'd drained the speed trans and dumped an extra  quarts
into the engine MORAL As Craig said don't be ashamed to get some
in person help the first time

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut It works great 
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than

Works for me I must say

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators and I've never 
seen nor heard of a vandal opening one  I imagine that there
would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have 
to crawl furthur under the car to open it  

Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods and do things
that don't get them dirty like keying your car dumping sand sugar
or mothballs in the gas tank TPing it etc

I did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons  I was wondering

most recent changes  March  addition of altautoskarting  rpw

                Welcome to RecAutos 

This article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general
description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and
some suggested guidelines for discussions  The keywords Monthly Posting'
will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of
newsreaders with kill facilities  This article is posted to all autos
groups but followups are directed only to recautos  If you don't
understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at
least for copies of the newuser documentation  Failing that please
subscribe to the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers and read the
documentation provided there

Introduction to the RecAutos newsgroup hierarchy

recautostech

is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design
construction diagnosis and service  Other discussions are largely
inappropriate especially For Sale ads

recautossport

is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving
automobiles  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles  Discussion from either of two viewpoints
spectator and participant is encouraged  Arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate as are most other discussions  For Sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles andor equipment
Discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law  remember the FBI reads Usenet

recautosdriving

is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles
Also if you must discuss  vs  or radar detectors or insert
your pet driving peeve boneheads do it here

recautosvw

is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen this includes VWs Audis
Seats etc  It was created on the grounds that the infovw mailing
list was very successful  It should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as
a mailing list

recaudiocar

is not properly part of the recautos hierarchy  it is however
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and
so is mentioned here

recautosantique

is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than  years
old although this is not a hardandfast rule

althotrod

is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the
recautos reader  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing
performance vehicles

altautosrodncustom

also not part of the official' hierarchy devoted to that peculiar
American hobby of customizing older cars

altautoskarting

for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting

recautos

is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics


Crossposting

Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the Newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed

Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
Usenet  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular
audience  This distinction is subtle but important  Radar Detector
articles for example are moreorless appropriate in recautos  They are
almost never appropriate in scielectronics or rechamradio and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in scielectronics or
rechamradio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group

Crossposting between any or all of the recautos groups is usually
inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is
truly advisable before sending your article  Consider setting FollowupTo
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost

Crossposting between recautos and miscconsumers is chancy at best in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US andor the use of
radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups

Most readers of scielectronics and recradio couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
recautos

It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups and Followupto  lines of
articles before posting a followup  In particular be wary of posting to
misctest recartsstartrek or talkbizarre or any combination of these
three  The life you save may be your own

Distribution

There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
partially control where the article goes it is called the Distribution
field  It may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system

The distribution of recautos is fairly extensive  As of this writing 
the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe Australia
New Zealand and some locations in Japan  With this in mind I offer the
following hints about use of the Distribution field in your article
headers and on article content

 Please take care not to send forsale ads about clapped out Ford
Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California i doubt that anyone in
either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange
reason likes Mavericks but only door Mavericks at that

 When posting technical questions please include the market for which
your car was manufactured  For example there are a number of differences
between a Europeanmarket Ford Escort and a USmarket Escort  Likewise
all cc and early cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel
injection European market cars usually got carbs often Webers  These
differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear
Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation

 Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting
in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values whereas
Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system  A future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonlyused
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that recautos
reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it

 Use the Distribution field to limit where your article goes when
possible  Within North America the values na north america can
canada and usa may be used  in addition the twoletter state
abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases eg if i wanted
to send an article only to New York and New Jersey i could put
nynj in a Distribution field  note that multiple commaseparated
values are legal  these distribution fields vary widely however so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area

The Dangers of Overgeneralization

To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article
Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc  What is
true for a  Buick with a cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
 Honda with a cc engine  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly
different from those in Idaho

The Need for Adequate Specification

When you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information
eg if you have a question about your Honda please specify year
model engine size etc  Otherwise most answers to your question may be
quite useless


Concerning Lemons

At one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two even Honda admits to this  Please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your brand x' automobile is terrible so all
brand x' automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from
the brand x' company  Such articles are worse than useless because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information


Concerning Flames

As much as we might wish it a flamefree newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur  Here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them a list of flameprone topics follows in the next section
of this posting

If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory don't imagine for a
minute that including the words No Flames' will work  It won't and
you'll get exactly what you deserve

If you're going to flame you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a wellknown reference  No one is likely to believe
bald unsupported assertions

Be careful about who you choose to insult  Consider not insulting anyone


Asking the Question

It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like Please
send email I don't read this group'  It is a much better idea to
end the question with Please send email if there is sufficient interest
I'll summarize the results in a later posting  I may miss posted responses
to this request'

Answering the Question

If someone wants to hop up their Yugo don't tell them to get a Mustang
Either be silent or give them useful advice  If someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket don't tell them to obey the law next time 
it's offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesn't directly
address the original question  In general don't post in order to see
your words in print and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
selfrighteous


Stale andor Inflammatory Topics

Certain topics are considered stale by old timers' while discussion of
them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings
about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether  Some topics are naturally inflammatory it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them  Some
of these topics include the following

  the mph speed limit in the US Pro and Con

  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
    radar detectors

  discussions over which radar detector is best

  discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why
    recautossport is not a sports car' group  everyone would argue
    about what constitutes a sports car'

  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's
    right to own and operate a radar detector

  Buy American' discussions

  clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates

  insert nationality here cars are terrible

  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive
      when I have a complete accurate answer it will be added to the
          commonlyasked questions article which is also posted monthly
          Until then please don't waste bandwidth on this topic  rpw

                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions


Tire Questions

Q  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean

A  Typically you will see something like HR  the  is the
    overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually
    narrower  The  is the aspect ratio' it indicates the height of the
    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width  Our example tire
    has a sidewall height of      mm  The  is the wheel
    diameter in inches there are also some special tires called TRX'
    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like
     which is in millimeters  The R means Radial and the H is a speed
    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly
    inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate  Common
    speed ratings are S MPH T MPH H MPH and V up to
    MPH

    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed
    rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find
    designations like R H the  indicates the pertire load
    associated with the speed rating  exceeding this load in continuous
    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice  What follows is
    a table showing a number of load indices' and corresponding maximum
    pertire loads

    Load Index                               
    Max Load Kg                   

    Note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table

    In some cases the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire
    size the LT designation indicates Light Truck and the P designation
    indicates Passenger car  If no letter is given then the application
    of the tire is Passenger car usage  As far as I know these letters
    only appear in the US market  The LT designation is prinicipally of
    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles  For
    the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference
    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at
    all

    If the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably  but may be 

    Tires with an MS mudsnow designation may have their speed rating
    reduced by  kmh about mph

    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature
    traction and treadwear  Temperature and Traction are graded
    A B and C with A the best and C the worst treadwear is
    a numeric rating  These values are of limited value as they
    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are
    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires

Q  My car has tires with a funny size designation  HR can i put
    normal tires on the car

A  Your tires are called TRX tires they were devised by Michelin
    Because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible
    with normal tires Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them
    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that
    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels
    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your
    car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels and horribly
    dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner
    or possibly blow out at high speed  TRX type tires are becoming hard
    to find in addition to Michelin Avon makes suitable tires  Goodyear
    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires

Q  Can I rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side
    of my car

A  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many
    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a
    car is now ok this group includes Michelin and Goodyear others
    for example Pirelli and Nokia will void warranties if such swapping
    is done  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before
    rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations

Q  How many snow tires should I buy and if I buy  which end of the
    car should I put them on

A  In short  and both ends  To explain many drivers in areas that don't
    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively or at all in snow
    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there
    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice  With a rear
    wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car
    going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car
    a function of the front axle  In a front wheel drive car you start
    stop and turn with the front end  The primary risk of putting the
    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes
    while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards

Radar Detectors and Speed Limits

Q  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits
    in this QA posting

A  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between
    miscconsumers and recautos always start long tedious and pointless
    flame wars  If you want to talk about either of these topics please
    subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it there

Safety Equipment

Q  Do airbags really work

A  Preliminary statistics suggest the following  Airbags work much
    better than no belts good  point belts alone work much better than
    Airbags alone and AirBags   point belts work slightly better than
     point belts alone  The con to airbags is that some designs tend
    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the
    explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but
    not all may knock the driver's hands from the wheel making retention
    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult

Brake Questions

Q  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned  Midas
    always wants to do this

A  No  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing
    rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors
    more often than is strictly necessary  if the rotors are not warped
    warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or
    to turn them  Note also that some rotors the rotors on many Hondas
    are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical
    to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped
    or badly grooved

Q  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down  Is
    this really a good idea

A  It used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade
    prone drum brakes  In modern disc brake equipped cars use of
    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases
    of long steep downhill runs  Otherwise modern disc brakes are more
    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they
    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings

    On the other hand many standard driver's license tests in the USA
    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking I
    suggest that before taking a US driver's test you either  learn to
    do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or  borrow a
    car with an automatic to take the test

Q  How often should I replace my brake fluid

A  Probably more often than you do  Traditional brake fluids tend to
    absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake
    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid  DOT type
    are older fluids DOT and DOT are newer specifications  The
    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry
    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling
    point is important in older brake fluid  DOT fluids have the lowest
    wet and dry boiling point requirements DOT fluids have better
    boiling point requirements and DOT fluids have the best boiling
    point requirements but DOT fluids are not clearly superior see
    the next QA for more details  While the requirements imply that
    DOT fluids are better than DOT fluids there may be specific
    cases where a DOT fluid is preferable but these are mostly
    competition applications  Otherwise DOT type fluids offer much
    improved brake pedal feel  Replacement once a year is recommended for
    DOT fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out
    fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid
    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly

Q  What about DOT brake fluids

A  This breaks down in to two parts  The DOT specification looks
    excellent for performance but the first DOT fluids were Silicone
    based  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition  Unlike DOT and
    DOT fluids they do not absorb water at all  While this may sound
    like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in
    such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any
    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring  The water will tend
    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where
    most of the corrosion occurs

    Because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to
    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly
    beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the
    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids

    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids   they are
    difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which
    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and  while they
    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT fluids they
    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable
    in effect from boiling DOT fluids  SIlicone fluids may make sense
    in some street car applications but they are certainly not
    recommended for high performance driving applications and the
    economics are questionable for street use

    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT standard
    that do not contain Silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably
    compatible with the older DOT and DOT fluids but I have little
    information at this time

Q  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at but it costs
    more  Is it worth it

A  This does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will
    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons  The short answer
    is that ABS costs more both initially and to maintain will generally
    work better for the average driver' that is to say a driver who does
    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques
    and may require the unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques
    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case

    Now for the long answer  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the
    car looking for signs of locked brakes  It may or may not be able
    be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several
    systems on the market  It cannot detect impending lockup which is
    what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence
    of lockup  The sensors used vary some of the less well designed
    sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and
    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original
    equipment or OEequivalent components

    When the sensors detect lockup the ABS system responds by unlocking
    the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the
    system  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the ABS
    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a
    sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could
    sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is
    achieved  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as
    the system cycles  The percentage of the time that the brakes are
    truly engaged is called the duty cycle' typically in an ABS system
    this is about   On dry pavement a trained driver can beat this
    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking
    on wet pavement braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform
    threshold braking nearly every time  Unfortunately on mud and on
    snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes
    locked only Audi of the manufacturers producing ABSequipped cars
    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this
    eventuality

    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves
    steering control  This is the case simply because if you are
    braking near the limit and turn the wheel the ABS will release
    the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off
    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied
    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly

    An important caution  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical
    braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on
    glare ice don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much
    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an
    ABS system in your car

    As far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential
    restrictions I've listed above you have to worry about the
    following   parts costs are much higher the OE master cylinder
    for my obscure european sedan lists for  but the OE master
    cylinder for the ABSequipped version of the same car lists for
    over   Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT
    silicone brake fluids in ABSequipped vehicles  Because of
    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system
    components regular I suggest annual replacement of brake fluid
    becomes very important

Q  What about this threshold braking business

A  normally I'd not put this in the consumers QA but recent
    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers
    in ABSequipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is
    needed here  rpw

    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high
    performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab
    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely and is much
    to be prefered  Basically the premise is that tires generate
    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but
    just before the wheels lock up entirely  Drivers who threshold
    brake learn to feel what this threshold' feels like and learn
    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake
    pedal  In many cars you can feel that you are near the
    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it
    In any case if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit you're
    not very near the threshold

    In a car with ABS often there is a twinge in the pedal just
    before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on
    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very
    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better
    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS
    take over

    Recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of
    accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with
    ABS systems  The police departments in question quickly blamed
    the new ABS systems but according to Autoweek magazine it now
    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the
    involved officers had any recent performance driving training
    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing
    brake pedal by pump braking' an old and discredited technique
    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to
    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system  If you
    think about it for a minute you'll realize that pump braking must
    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least
     so if you cut the  duty cycle of an ABS system by that
    much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason
    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective
    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS if
    you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at
    the pedal will be sufficient    

Gas Questions

Q  Does High Octane gasoline help

A  Maybe maybe not  Some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the
    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used
    On most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your
    car run well  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car
    needs

Q  My car was made for leaded gasoline  Will unleaded gas hurt it

A  It is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear
    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise  The actual increase
    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded
    gasolines actually contain very little lead  You should however
    check your owner's manual many cars from the early s do not
    actually require leaded gasoline

Q  Do fuel treatments help  What kind should I use

A  Some do and some don't  During the winter it is a good idea to use
    dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems
    Never use an additive containing Methanol sometimes called Methyl
    Alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs
    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection

    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol sometimes
    called Ethyl Alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owner's
    manual on your car before  using these  Most manufacturers consider
     Ethanol acceptable in gasoline  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol
    Isopropanol and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected
    cars

    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with
    fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that
    do the same job  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain
    Ethanol or Methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything
    in your gas tank

    There are a small number of particularly good additives these are
    noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work
    much much better  Among these are Chevron Techron Redline SL
    Wurth Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber' and BG K  A bottle of one of these
    once every six months is highly recommended

Q  What about detergent gasolines

A  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat BMW
    has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this
    test may advertise that fact  Stickers indicating passage of the test
    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations  If such
    gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional
    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean
    engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits

Lubrication Questions

Q  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean

A  There are several different items encoded  There is a twoletter
    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer	
    uses in the oil this looks like SESFCD or such  The S codes are
    for gasoline engine applications the C codes are for diesel engine
    applications  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels
    of protection are developed thus SF is considered better than SE
    SE is considered better than SD and so forth

    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight  This is either
    a single number eg  weight or a pair of numbers separated by
    the letter W eg W  The latter type is much more commonly
    used these days and are the only type that most automobile
    manufacturers specify in operators manuals  The first number in the
    designation W is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold
    the W stands for winter'  The second number  is the viscosity
    of the oil when hot  There is a trick here the oil doesn't actually
    get thicker turn from  weight to  weight as it gets hotter  What
    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity
    of a cold  weight oil  as it gets hotter it doesn't get thin as fast
    as a W oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the
    viscosity of a hot  weight oil

    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not
    all W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all
     weight oils have the same viscosity when hot  Note also that the
    novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has
    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX W oils
    do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time  W
    W and W oils work very well though

Q  Are quick lube' places any good

A  Some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out
    there  Let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure
    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on
    your wallet at all times

Q  Are oil additives like Slick or Tufoil any good

A  Slick and Tufoil are PTFEbased additives  Many of these have
    come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased
    additives that have been around since the early 's  PTFE is the
    chemical name for TeflonTM a trademark owned by DuPont In general
    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products  Most USENET
    responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight
    increase of MPG after application smoother revving but long term
    results whether PTFE additives are effective after K miles are
    debatable  Some manufacturers such as Saab claim that either the
    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes
    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage  Some BMW owners
    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of
    Slick  to their cars  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick
    Dealer  that Slick should not be used in Japanese motors as
    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine  Otherwise there are
    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives

    On the other hand there are satified Slick  customers in the world

Q  Do synthetic oils really work

A  Yes but  More specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics
    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by
    oil manufacturers  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to
    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your
    car  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change
    the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty
    as conventional oils

    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter
    entirely Amsoil Redline and AGIP are very highly regarded and very
    effective  Mobil  synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however

Q  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals
    How often should I change my oil

A  It depends on how you drive  If your car always or nearly always
    gets warmed up and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs
    down the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine  If however
    you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you
    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up
    to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often
    perhaps at  mile intervals given that most manufacturers are
    now specifying  mile intervals  If you don't drive your car
    much at all say  miles a year then you probably want to change
    oil every six months anyway  If you are storing a car during the winter
    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out
    of storage

Misc Questions

Q  My car has a timing belt  I hear that bad things happen when they
    break  What's the story

A  It depends on the internal design of the motor  Early Ford Escorts
    for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but
    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt
    Some Honda motors will not be damaged but others will be

    If no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the
    belt at least every  miles some cars may require more frequent
    replacement  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic  Also ask if
    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time
    for example the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have
    a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize
    destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage
    as a side effect  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water
    pump can be a costly mistake

Q  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it
    self destructs when the timing belt breaks

A  For performance reasons  Compromising piston design so that the
    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression
    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are
    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance
    oriented vehicles

Q  What causes Unintended Acceleration

A  The final report of the National Highway Transportation and Safety
    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be
    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the
    same time be consistent with the physical evidence  The NHTSA report
    goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator
    is probably the cause

Unfortunately I've got another story to add to this  My girlfriend
and I were driving through west LA and got pelted by a rock just as
we were pulling away from a stoplight  The scary thing was that the
rock was heavy enough to put a decentsized dent in the door of my '
Riviera which is pretty much solid Detriot Iron  Couple of inches
higher and it would have gone through the window

I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show and would like to 
hear your comments

MILITECHtm is yet another oil additive But the demonstration of this
product really impressive if it didn't cheat

The setup of the demo is fairly simple A cone shaped rotor is
half submerged in a small oil sink filled with motor oil The rotor
is powered by an electronic motor A metal pad is pressed against
the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction 
The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench

Before MILITECH was added the rotor was stopped with about  lbft
of torque You pick the brand of oil no difference Once MILITECH was 
added to the oil the rotor could not be stopped even with  lbft of
torque 

Here is the good part even after the salesman emptied the oil sink 
you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it

They say you need only add oz per quart of oil every k miles A  oz
bottle is 

I still have my doubts If this product is really so great why it was
so little known The salesman said it is widely used in military I didn't
believe it  The demo was so impressive that I bought a bottle against
my common sense

Has anyone heard of or actually used this product Is it real
If you are going to the auto show please visit this stand on the 
second floor See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not

this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly
asked automotive questions the other article contains questions
of general consumer interest and is broken out to facilitate
crossposting to miscconsumers  rpw

last change  February  CT now permits radar detector usage
    new tiretraction qa  rpw

                Commonly Asked Questions

Radar Questions

Q  Where are radar detectors illegal

A  In the US currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit
    all usage of radar detectors  New York prohibits their use in
    large trucks  In Canada they are illegal in Manitoba Ontario
    Quebec Newfoundland and PEI Prince Edward Island  They
    are apparently are illegal through most if not all of Europe
    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other
    jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal

Q  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used  Do they really work

A  Usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in Canada
    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia  It is unsafe
    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and DC
    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently
    available super Het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate
    more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted
    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected
    by the current generation of detector detectors  Note that a
    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned
    on

Q  What is VASCAR  Is it some kind of Radar

A  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance
    computer  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target
    vehicle passes landmarks  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR
    system

Q  What is Ka band radar  Where is it used  Should a radar detector be
    able to handle it 

A  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
    in socalled photoradar installations  In these installations a
    lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a  degree angle to the
    direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit
    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle  Because of the low
    power and the  degree angle many people believe that a radar
    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit
    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
    capability anyway  The number of locales where photoradar is in use
    is limited and some question the legality of such units  Best advice
    learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they
    are used or else don't speed

Q  Do radar jammers work  Are they legal

A  Quick answer  No and Not in the USA
    Detailed answer  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all
    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the
    military  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the
    Federal Communications Commission of the USA

Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions

Q  What are understeer and oversteer

A  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a
    car while cornering near the limit' limit of adhesion that is
    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to
    be descriptive of the situations they encounter  Simply put they
    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less'
    or understeer' or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer'
    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that
    untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast won't get into
    trouble  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle
    in a corner  Oversteer is designed into some more performance
    oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle Trailing
    throttle oversteer or TTO  In extreme cases lifting on the throttle
    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or
    spinning

    Some technical details  in a corner at speed the tires on the car
    will develop what are called slip angles' the slip angle is the
    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling
    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to
    travel  In understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle
    than the rear wheels  In oversteer the rear wheels have a greater
    slip angle than the front wheels

Q What is a revmatched downshift

A When downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear
   than it was in the higher gear  However during a downshift normally
   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop
   rather than increase  In revmatched downshift you blip the throttle
   before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to
   the new speed  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift

Q What does heelandtoe mean

A Heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while
   braking  This is normally challenging because you need the right foot
   for both the brake and throttle  It is called heelandtoe because you
   use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to
   match revs for the downshift  In many modern cars this is a misnomer
   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side
   on the throttle

   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the
   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing
   the same thing

Q What is doubleclutch downshifting

A While your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of
   three things  nothing declutch once or declutch twice  The reason for
   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the
   transmission to the speed of the engine  This is usually coupled with
   revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch
   engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission
   speed up

   The procedure is as follows
    declutch
    move gearshift lever to neutral
    engage clutch
    match revs
    declutch
    move gearshift lever to next lower gear
    engage clutch

   This sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural
   The problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the
   synchronizers within the gearbox  In transmissions without synchros or
   with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift
   Basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at
   all  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good
   condition

Q What do the numbers for acceleration from   mile skidpad and
   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean  May they be compared

A In short  not as much as the magazines want you to believe and
    almost never

   In more detail  the acceleration numbers mph and  mile times
   in the US may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the
   same source  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine
   that comparing a Road  Track number to a Car  Driver number is quite
   pointless  Keep in mind too that the same variation applies from
   driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the
   major part of the equation

   Skidpads vary and even if they didn't skidpad figures are really
   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically
   when tire compounds change  DO NOT make any assumptions about the
   comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers
   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however Skidpads
   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools  They are simply
   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires

   Slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the
   automobile's transient response  However they are also heavily influenced
   by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the
   car's envelope  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making
   a buying decision  For example they don't tell you what the rear end
   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber  When a car
   has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport'
   setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving  The list of
   caveats could go on for page after page

Q My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference according
   to his freshman physics textbook and that you can't ever accelerate
   or corner at more than G  Does he know what he's talking about

A  in short  he hasn't got a clue

    in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics
   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth  dry and nondeformable
   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a
   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating
   temperature

   Pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser
   extent  Tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a
   substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been
   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match
   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over  In a tire
   at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses
   inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling
   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term  The colder a tire
   is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will
   be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its
   proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some
   part of the tire actually reverting'' to liquid which is mostly like
   to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking
   This latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal
   street driving so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of
   high speed track driving don't worry about it

   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction
   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters
   accelerate at more than G and race cars corner and brake at more than
   G  Because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible
   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of
   grip  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques
   such as Finite Element Analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism

Misc Questions

Q  What does name or acronym stand for

A  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked
    about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names
    as misinformation abounds on the net  In particular NEVER
    ask in rechumor if you want a useful result

    Saab   Svenska Aeroplan A B
              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation

    Alfa   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili
              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company

    Fiat   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino
              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin

    BMW    Bayerische Motoren Werke
              or Bavarian Motor Works

    MG     Morris Garage


Q  Does VW own Porsche

A  No  Porsche is a publicly held company controlled by the Porsche and
    Piech families  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VWAudi
    which causes some confusion  Since currently Porsche is in some
    financial difficulty there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may
    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future but this
    is only speculation at this time

New article as of  February   rpw


Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite
automotive topics rather fewer know how to do it  This article
will provide the essential information for doing so on standard
Unix systems  A shell script and examples of alias file setups
are included which presently run on a Sparc  here at balltowncmacom
for a number of mailing lists  Note that if you do set up an automotive
mailing list please let me know of the request address so that I can
list it in the montly recautos posting  Also inform the keeper of the
Usenet listoflists check newsanswers for this monthly posting

First of all to get anywhere you need to either  be a sysadmin
or  have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin  It is also
important that you have reasonably good network connectivity if it seems
like you get everything several days after anyone else or that you
have trouble getting email through then your network connectivity is
probably not good enough

Listserv

There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv which
is available from several ftp servers on the network  Details of
the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this
article but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should
probably  look at listserv carefully

The Alias file

On a typical unix system there is a file named usrlibaliases on
whichever file server is your mail host it contains lines such as

foo   bar baz bletch


which means that any email sent the name foo' on that host is
redistributed to users bar baz and bletch  thus the simplest
possible email list is 

myfavoritecar  member member member myaddress
myfavoritecarrequest myaddress

this has a couple of problems the most noticeable one being that
you have to be superuser to edit the alias file  however you can
do the following with the connivance of your sysadmin

myfavoritecar includehomemydirmiscautosmyfavoritecarlist
myfavoritecarrequest myaddress

Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated
addresses  This file can be in the list admin's home directory
owned by the list admin

Bounced Mail

this still has a problem bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the
members of the list which is generally considered somewhat irritating
Therefore the way that the driving school mailing list is set up
is instructive Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup
by the way  I'm not sure where he got it from


schoolrequest   welty
schoolrebroadcast  includehomenewweltymiscautosschoollist
school usrlocaladmbinexplscript school
ownerschool schoolrequest
ownerschoolout schoolrequest


here's what is going on here

the owner and request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail
coming from the network  the request address also serves as the point
of contact for administrative duties

school is what people send mail to instead of pointing at addresses
it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending
the email  schoolbroadcast of which nobody except me knows the name
the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity points at the
actual list members

the shell script i use is as follows


binsh
cd tmp
sed e 'ReplyTod' e 'Senderd' e 'From d'  
        echo ReplyTo balltowncmacom 
         echo ErrorsTo requestballtowncmacom 
         echo Sender requestballtowncmacom 
         cat   
        usrlibsendmail om f requestballtowncmacom 
                F The  Mailing List rebroadcast
exit 


note that this script does not know the name of the list the name
is passed in from outside so that the script may be used for multiple
lists i run several out of this site
the script excises ReplyTo Sender and From lines from the incoming
message substitutes for Sender and ReplyTo and adds Errorsto
 of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the request
or owner addresses if this header rewrite is done

For digested lists there is some digestification software around
Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version
of this posting

This is a twosided problem Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time
The breeding of these lowlife's is getting worse our justice system is at best
extremely weak to handle these problems That is why lowabiding citizens should have
the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary 
anywhere a threat is imminent

My Camaro my pride and joy got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back
The persons that did that were eventually caught lucky for me but not before
having trashed the car

On another occasion on my way from Texas to Florida I had stopped in a small motel
for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida About  youths were disturbing my
car setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out When I and another tenant
walked out with a  Magnum and a  automatic respectively they vanished 
Needless to say I immediately packedup and left

Watch out for carjacking and staged accidents They can be deadly

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators and I've never
seen nor heard of a vandal opening one  I imagine that there
would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have
to crawl furthur under the car to open it

Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods and do things
that don't get them dirty like keying your car dumping sand sugar
or mothballs in the gas tank TPing it etc

USUALLYgo enough places and you'll see stuff happen you didn't think did

While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights
I know that Saab started using them about  years ago  My  Saab 
didn't have them but a friend's  Saab  certainly did  In addition
to the confentional taillight mounted backup lights they had another
set integrated into the front turn signal assembly  For those of you who
don't remember Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic
growth about the size of a National Geographic magazine sticking out
of the front fender which incorporated amber parking lights amber side
marker lightsreflectors white cornering lamps like American luxury
cars aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators
on and white backup lights aimed towards the back of the car when you
have selected reverse gear  The glossy brochure showed how these front
mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards pot holes kid's
toys etc that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the
wheels turned while backing up

Les Bartel's comments
Sorry I can't help you with your question but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket AC units  I have a FrostKing or FrostTemp
forget which aftermarket unit on my Cavalier and am quite unhappy with
it  The fan is noisy and doesn't put out much air  I will never have
an aftermarket AC installed in any of my vehicles again  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience

Les Bartel			I'm going to live forever

Let me add my  in I had a AC installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the AC that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine I have talked to other people that have had the same
result Don't know if this is just a probable with Ford or what

 I looked into getting ac installed on my  Honda CRX Si
 The unit is  plus shipping installation is like   hours on
 top of that  This is a hunk of change
 
 Does anyone know any place that does aftermarket ac installation
 not with a Honda ac unit but some third party unit
 
 I cannot seem to find anyone who can put a third party ac unit in a
 Honda  I am in No Carolina so I would prefer some place nearby but
 any references would be handy

 Thx Andy brandtcsuncedu

Les Bartel's comments
Sorry I can't help you with your question but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket AC units  I have a FrostKing or FrostTemp
forget which aftermarket unit on my Cavalier and am quite unhappy with
it  The fan is noisy and doesn't put out much air  I will never have
an aftermarket AC installed in any of my vehicles again  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience

Les Bartel			I'm going to live forever

Let me add my  in I had a AC installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the AC that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine I have talked to other people that have had the same
result Don't know if this is just a problem with Ford or what

 I have been looking at buying a  Jeep Laredo and was wondering
if anyone had any bad or good experiences with this model Is it
all that much different than the other YJs 

 It looks feels and sounds like a nice vehicle even thought the
price is rather steep for an ' K Canadian

This is consistent with the pre'   The engine before that was a

Bzzzt  Wrong answer  It really depends on whether you are talking model
year or date of manufacture  For instance mine was a ' but was
manufactured in August of '  Prior to  all s were o liter  For
the ' and ' model years they were  liter  for the  and 
model years they were  liter EXCEPT for the ' Carerra RS which was a

' they went to  liter and there was only a single model the SC think
of it as a cross between the S and the Carerra models  note all the above
are based on MODEL year not date of manufacture  

I stand corrected  This is all from memory mind you  

As for the rev happy behavior the earlier cars are even more prone to
this  The  liter cars used low compression engines and suffered a bit
in this regard  The early  liter and  liter engines also got a good
dose of smog gear as well  The  and  liter engines were far and away
the quickest revvers of the lot 

Yeah that's what I was trying to say  No REALLY

Well if you want to stick the nose of your car up the ass of a  foot semi 
I suppose it's your neck however I'm not going to let you kill me in the 
bargain  If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death 
due to less that wise driving practices then TOUGH

Well I never wrote that I would act as you described  I stated that I 
would not block a wouldbe passer  I would not block a wouldbe passer
for their own good or for any reason other than I was prevented from 
doing so due to the traffic circumstance  I fail to see how deterring a
passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances
of being involved in an accident fatal or otherwise  In fact I could
imagine how blocking a wouldbe passer would actually INCREASE your 
chances of being offed or involved in an accident especially if 
this passer is riding your bumper  Intentionally blocking a person
riding your bumper is certainly NOT a wise driving practice it 
only causes the jam to become more congested 
 
I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the 
road behind   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a pack 
of vehicles I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you 
decribe  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal 
with this fact of life or I wait to a slow passer to complete their 
pass and make way for the pack to clear  If someone decides then to 
pull up on my bumper I signal my intention to move to the right and 
do so at the first opportunity  hope they will open the jam  I 
feel this is not only courteous driving but ALOT safer than the 
actions you advocate  There are actually many courteous drivers 
on the road who do not intentionally impede others  

If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they 
are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights or if all 
else fails will briefly speed up slow down so they MIGHT get the 
message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass  I feel it is never 
safe to ride anyone's bumper  IF someone is intentionally blocking 
traffic because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty 
or for some unfathomable reason I feel they deserve at the very least
derision       Sorry this is soooooooo long

	Wasn't the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he
could see where he was backing up  Although reverse lights on the sides
are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the
path of the car I don't think warnings were their original intents since they
are colored white

Ah yes the big chunks down in the sump The solution is simple Sort of
like the advice my Aunt always gave  never scratch your ear with anything
except your elbow

If you have pieces of ring con rods valve heads or stems just reach into
the sump through the hole in the block that was associated with the creation
of those large bits and pieces Anything you can't remove with one hand 
through the hole in the block may safely be left in place

I have just taken delivery on a new GM car Firebird with a 
clearcoat finish  I assume that it is probably urethane since the 
industry has moved in that direction in paints
 
In years past it used to be recommended that owners wait up to 
 days before you wax a car for the paint to cure  The dealer 
shop manager said this also but I'm not sure that he wasn't just 
basing it on past tradition  Does anyone know if this is still a 
recommended practice or is it better to go ahead and wax right 
away nonabrasive new car wax with the newer finishes

Is clear coat really worth it  Yes on the showroom floor the cars
have this deep lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs
that aren't clear coated  On the other hand it seems that every clear
coated car that I've seen on the road in a parking lot etc has
fine scratches throughout the paint job  As does alas my  Laser

Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed
When I picked it up it had that same showroom shine that I remember
from a year ago when I bought it  Several days ago I took my car
to the dealership for some work  As an added bonus they washed my
car  Unfortunately whoever washed it either didn't get the roof
which is black the rest of the car is red completely clean before
he dried it or he used a dirty towel  Now my showroom shine is a
haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light
hits the roof at a particular angle

I am to put it mildy somewhat peeved about this  Do I have any 
chance of getting the dealership to do something about this
My guess is 'no'  Is there any product on the market that provides
a solution to this problem  Or am I faced with the prospect of
having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches
Information commiseration and sympathy all greatly appreciated

I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter I've been
doing it my self over  miles on my current toyota truck I've got
over k I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a
transmission My experiences suggest otherwise What techniques do you use

	Yeah  I don't use the clutch all the time either  I've done it
with Fords BMW Datsun and Chevy and it works fine  I can't think of
any reason that it would damage the tranny  Essentially you are just
doing what the synchros do anyhow  match the engine speed with the
tranny speed and slip it into gear


On some old pieces of junk I drove the transmission was so
worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless
To date I've driven rabbits datsuns comets fords  a chevy Some where
harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother
quicker  easier they where to shift

My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever If for some reason I miss the shift window
I lightly press the accelerator  try agian I've found that clutchless
shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms  I also skip gears some
times using   

	Sounds about right  I usually slip it out during throttledown
and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
usually about a second and then slip it into gear

     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it The camshaft took 
     weeks to get because it is on national back order 

     Everything on the engine is unique to the  year They went to a new

No way would I ever buy another Acura It is highly overrated

Well you could always go with a  Mustang LX with a pleasant V but the
diamond star cars TalonEclipseLaser put out  hp in the turbo models
and  hp in the AWD turbo models  These cars also have handling to match
the muscle and are civil in regular driving conditions rather than having a
harsh stiff rideThe AWD Turbo is clearly the better choice of the two
because of all that torque steer on the front drive model but you may have
to go with a leftover or slightly used model for that price rangetough

An audible alarm is just an annoyance  to either a professional or
amateur  NOBODY LISTENS TO AUDIBLE ALARMS ANYMORE  The thieves know

This is why I think there ought to be a heavy fine on false alarms
I'm really honked off about the fact that due to all the
cars with cruddy alarms crying wolf no one will pay any attention
to my car if its alarm ever goes off for real

 Depends on your area in the city nobody thinks about itbut at a mall or
something near the suburbs people do at least glance over  Remember an
alarm is only a deterent not a prevention  If a thief sees two cars he
likes one has an alarm and the other doesn't he's obviously going to skip
the alarmed car and avoid the hassle  There is a way around every alarm but
at least you've got SOMETHING on your side

I'm plannig to trade my Sentra SER in with a NX  My car has 
miles on it and is a ' model  The NX the dealer is selling is a '
model with miles on it  It has a TBar Roof ac and an airbag
which my Sentra does not have  They are asking for   Is that a fair
deal  The only thing I noticed about the NX is that the engine did not
seem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical
engine  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine
to it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine thuis the NX's
engine is a little tight  So if I buy the NX and excercise it
well should that slight power problem go away  Any advice on this will be
much appreciated  Thanks  Please reply via email if possible

In article AprVirginiaEDU ejvjVirginiaEDU Erik Velapoldi writes
This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway
Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  Four or five
cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly
a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
in the head by one of the larger rocks  I don't recall if she 
made it but I think she was comatose for a month or so and 
doctors weren't holding out hope that she'd live

What the hell is happening to this great country of ours  I
can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
 pound rocks  Has our society really stooped this low

   Yes Nobody is watching them  If they get caught there is no punishment
 at all  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping
 with a goodsized belt and then taken into some hospital to see first hand
 what kind of damage such accidents cause   Of course this doesn't happen
 any more  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching
 him some respect for others  A person with that little respect would
 inevitably wind up dead early anyway

   The problem is creeping gradualism  If you put a frog into hot water
 he just jumps out  But if you put him into cold water and then everso
 gradually heat it the frog will cook  This is what the entertainment
 industry and lack of religious moral and educational standards in our
 modern North American society have done to us over the years  Now that
 we are about to be 'cooked' we may have woken up too late


Erik velapold
 
Society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams The basic reason
is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
No Big Deal Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV we can abort 
children on demand and kill the sick and old at will So why be surprised
when some kids drop  lbs rocks and kill people They don't care because the
message they hear is Life is Cheap

  And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much 
 about it either  With both parents working in this society where is
 the stabilizing influence at home   Latchkey children are everywhere
 And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to
 whatever violent hatepromoting music and videos they like because no
 one is home to stop it

  This day and age when there is about  times more things to learn
 than when I went to school our answer to this increased knowledge is
 shorter school hours and more leisure time  I say keep the kids in
 school longer feed them good food and teach them something and when
 they get home have a parent there to interact and monitor them  There
 is a very old and now forgotten proverb a child left on his own will
 bring a parent to grief  Daycare systems are not the answer  This is
 just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to
 whom it's not a lifelong committment but rather just a job

overpass quickly to see who did it We figured it was kids reported it and
left
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company He was
in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away They caught the  year old

Wrt performance converter lockup is purely irrelevant  The lockup only
occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG  Mind you
a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG but the additional
mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked
converter clutch than its inherent losses take away

the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions  i get much
stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup which i can induce
by briefly lifting off  then quickly but not too quickly to trigger
a kickdown applying throttle  above  rpms the convertor will never
unlock  it would kickdown first

who says there's no skill involved in driving an automatic  i think
of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal  with
my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my
right foot while having both hands to steer

     I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single male
drivers under  yrs old were paying on performance cars Here's a summary of
the replies I received
 
 
 
 

 
I'm not under  anymore but is  close enough
 
 Dodge Stealth RTTwin Turbo hp model
No tickets no accidents own a house have taken defensive driving 
airbag abs security alarm single
 
year   decut State Farm Insurance this includes the additional 
for the  umbrella policy over my car and house  The base
policy is the standard      policy required in DE
 
After nd defensive driving course it will be  less
 
I bought the car in September   The company I was with never had
and accident or ticket in  years quoted me 
 
Hope this helps

    You asked about insurance for performance cars  Well last year
    I was in a similar situation before I bought my car and made the
    same inquiry as you
 
    Age  then and now
    Car  Eagle Talon TSi AWD
    Driving Record Clean
    State Illinois
    Cost  mos
 
    I turn  in May and the insurance goes down to  mos
    Also I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company
 
    I've got a couple other friends w AWDs and they pay more
    than I do different ins companies also so maybe I'm just lucky

I am beyond the under  age group but I have an experience a few
years ago that might be interesting to you  I owned a  Toyota Celica
GT  I decided to buy myself a gift  a more exotic car  Front runners
included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche   model years
I narrowed it down to those two  I liked the simplicity and handling
and snob appeal too of driving a Porsche  The Supra Turbo was less
money and had more features and performance  almost a personal luxury
car  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 
I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the  but i
decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way  I asked
about what would happen to my rate with either car
 
If you buy the Supra your rate classification will be the same as
the Celica the ' Celica was considered a subcompact and for that
year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because
the car will be  years newer  Our lowerrisk division will continue
to handle your account
 
If you buy the Porsche  we'll have to change you to the standard
higher rate company and your rate will double  And if you go with
a  it's another story again  we'll cover the rest of this year
but cancel you after that
 
But the Supra is much faster than the  and the  is actually
faster than the standard   That doens't make sense
 
 That's what the book says  We don't insure Corvettes either  For
some reason the underwriters consider Supras  and their drivers 
as very traditional and conservative
 
I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons  The Porsche
dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure
guy in the back room  At equal monthly payments it would have taken
a year longer to pay for the Porsche plus its higher insurance  I
concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto
theft

I live in Idaho  When I was  many years ago  years I bought a Trans
Am new  Insurance was about year  When I turned  it immediately
dropped to year  I had not had any accidents before or after this was
strictly an age change  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I
sold the car  years ago  My F pickup is about year less
 
The real amazing thing is that when I woke up at age  I felt SO MUCH MORE
RESPONSIBLE than I was before

Single  years old Eagle Talon Turbo AWD  fullcover reasonable
 liability
No tickets No violations No accidents knock on wood
Mass
 
	One thing that makes a HUGE difference in MASS is the town you live in
I'm personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance
of Boston  If I moved to the absolute best it would go down to about
 if I moved to the worst it would be 
 
	Also one accident and a couple of tickets would probably add another

I have a  Mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd am  years old and have no
tickets that went on my record  I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago
and pay  a year with full coverage at State Farm  I did get a small
discount because of my alarm system a year  I only live  miles from
Chicago but if I actually lived in the city the price would be about 
a year
 
I'm over  but in case you're interested anyway I'm insuring a  SHO
for  month  Thats k personalk totalk property with
 deductible glass and towing State Farm
 
 
 
Unless you are under  or have been driving for less than 
years I think you are being seriously ripped off  I don't have
one of the performance cars you listed but if your record is
clean then you should not be paying over K
 
Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find
Although rates are supposed to be standardized I've found that
most places I initially call give me some ridiculously high
quote and finaly I hit one that is much lower
 
Also I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at
renewal no accidents tickets car gets older to maintain a low
rate  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance
companies 
 
Good luck

Hello
	I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my  Honda
Civic Si  I was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not
too drastic  I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new
header  Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give
me  I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part  Are there
any other comparines would make Honda parts  

	Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't
screw up the car  Things like new injectors new fuel injection chip etc
I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a
difference

	I don't really want to change the cam etc because I have heard that it
would be much harder on the engine

EMail relpies prefered please and I will post a summary of all the replies
Thanks for any help you may have to offer

The biggest hurdle for automatics IMHO is not shifting speed
per se but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you
try to force it to shift manually  

This was the biggest fault with the Subaru ECVT  it took SOOOOOO
LONNNNNNNNGGGGG for the tranny to find the right ratio

The sales propaganda says the Saturn automatic is effectively an
electronicallyshifted manual  Might this mean that Saturn has
conquered the problem  I dunno only driven Saturn speeds

INPUT PLEASE

Another question  Any plans for a manualtrans Chrysler LH
Does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo

The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers  test drivers for the
Buick Co when Durant was there

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in  he took Chevrolet and
others with him  As mentioned before they founded the successful
Chevrolet company

A littleknown fact is that the Chevrolet Co actually took over GM
That was how Durant got back in charge of GM legally his new company
Chevrolet Co did the buying and GM was a division of Chevrolet

After  and into the Sloan era GM shuffled things so that the GM
board was superior but there was always a degree of autonomy given
the Chevy division presumably because of the initial structure
If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book Chevy
division reports directly to th floor not through the passenger
car division which covers Buick Olds Cadillac and OaklandPontiac

Ford tried that also back in   My  Ranger Pickup had the horn at

God intended it to be   I drove two different cars then the other an

Not one of Ford's better ideas

I rented an Oldsmobile Achieva is that a yuppie name or what and a
Nissan Stanza  They both had automatics  I'm a manual transmission
bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were
better shifters than I am  And yes they responded very quickly to
kickdown requests  The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure
out which gear I was in  The Olds may have also but I don't
remember  I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 
mph when my foot told it No I really want to accelerate quickly

I would still prefer a manual but I won't delude myself into thinking
that I can outaccelerate a modern automatic  And I'm very smooth at
shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic

Dear Netters

I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon ' or ' TSi AWD

In particular the manual transmission electrical system
and brakes were below par in both models  A friend of mine
ownes a ' TSi AWD and he has had  brake jobs pads one
stuck valve and some clutchtransmission problem something
about stickinggrinding into second gear  This doesn't seem
too bad if one beats on his car

I am willing to suffer reliabilityfor speed and looks  Seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three  Anyway can
anyone please let me know how you like your Talon and any

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy  it switches to
sport mode when the electronics figure it  not when the driver sets
the switch which is the proper way to do it IMO  so what does sport
mode entail  several things

 revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy

 delayed upshifts  ie if you lift off briefly it will remain in the
	low gear  this is handy if you are charging through corners and
	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's
	another curve approaching

 part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is
	depressed rather than the position of the pedal  modern
	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode
	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about
	to turn red  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as
	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough

also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage
than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that
the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a
big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to
use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an
inattentive driver cruising on the highway at  in th gear of a
 speed  

how many  of people who drive manuals really know what the best
gear to use is for every conceivable situation  i'm sure there will
be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with
all possible scenarioratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do
better  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved
wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear
low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high
revs and small throttle opening  the explanation is quite simple if
one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight

In recautos you write

if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission
it can't be half bad  

This McLaren autotransmission I still think it's only half auto
but You may be right has NOTHING to do with Your GM Chrysler Volvo
or whatever auto transmission It's a normal manual transmission
gearbox with clutch and all but there are servo motors which do
the shifting 

That means there is no power loss in the drivetrain if You take out 
minimal mechanical friction and the samiauto transmissions 
Ferrari Williams McLaren don't tell You when to shift
either However these transmissions share an important disadvantage
with Your stock autotrannie They are EXPENSIVE

As long as these servoshifted gearboxes aren't available on 
'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual I just can't see an
advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the
loss in mileage and power except maybe in real heavy traffic But
then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway

There's no point in making a religion out of this I just wanted to
point out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion so there's
no need for a flame war

My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever If for some reason I miss the shift window
I lightly press the accelerator  try agian I've found that clutchless
shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms  I also skip gears some
times using  

        Sounds about right  I usually slip it out during throttledown
and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
usually about a second and then slip it into gear
 
   So how did you guys learn this Is it something you were
born with or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few
times how many times
 
   I would think you'd have to have a certain amount of feel
for it to begin with Some people would never get it and others
like me would never have the guts to try it unless maybe you
were planning to buy a new transmission anyway
 
   BTW I've heard that quite a few truckers and race car
drivers shift this way

I am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a VW
Passat GLX  How does it compare to a Toyota Camry  I thought the car
looked very solid stable and European  Only disappointment so far is
that that it doesn't offer an airbao my next question is why isn't VW
offering automobiles with airbags  Should I pay the extra three
thousand for a BMW  is even though it is smaller and less powerful
than than the Passat

    I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure
 we are compliant with the regulations  The trouble with regulations is
 that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do not what
 you should do instead

     I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol
 which has a definite CFCphaseout schedule  Of course the cause of
 the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the
 Ozone Depletion Problem

     Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast
 to ban the ozonedepleting CFC chemicals and not gasolines and other
 greenhousegasproducing compounds  The greenhouse effect produced by
 infraredtrapping gasses like CO and methane and the ozonehole problem
 produced by longlived chlorinecontaining molecules are not the same
 thing  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's
 chlorofluorocarbons than it is to stop producing CO and methane which
 are natural byproducts of combustion and of living animal organisms
 Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help
 the greenhousegas problem but would do nothing for the ozone problem

Hey NISSAN why aren't you guys making any station wagons  You used
to make a wagon on every platform SENTRA STANZA MAXIMA and now
NONE AT ALL

In fact they make some but they just don't sell them here in US

Sunny California is a l wagon based on Sentra
Avenil is a l WDWD wagon It looks like Infinity G 
but actually it's independently designed to be a wagonI mean it's 
not based on any sedans 
 
Nissan had better consider to sell them here

After buying my SER and really loving it I would like to buy another
NISSAN product for my wife  but prefer a wagon  I've owned minivans
and don't prefer them

How about an ALTIMA wagon  or a sentra wagon would do

Sounds nice But I doubt they have a plan Coz Avenil was introduced 
to replace any sedan based wagon

or here's an even better suggestion why don't you guys go ahead and
buy the rest of Fuji Heavy Industries Subaru and put either an
inline  or V into the LEGACY WD wagon  I'd buy the Legacy in a
minute if it had a Nissan engine instead of the Horizontal  that they
seem sentimentally attached to

With all the Camry Accord Taurus Volvo and Subaru wagons out there
 it's got to be a market segment that would be worthwhile

I can wait a year or two  but if you don't have something to compete
by the  model I may have to go elsewhere

 While not exactly a service incident I had a similar experience recently  
 when I bought a new truck
 I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  
 agreed on a price I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
 and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck  
 When I returned I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  
 get to me When I finally got in there everything went smoothly until he  
 started adding up the numbers He then discovered that they had  
 miscalculated the tax  license by about  He then said he needed  
 another  from me I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  
 their problem I wasn't giving them any more money The finance guy then  

A similar thing happend to me a year ago  I bought a used Ford Bronco
which has since been stolen      and few weeks after I paid
and took delivery they sent a letter telling me they goofed and 
miscalculated the license renewal by  and that I need to send
in a check to avoid further delay in the processing of my registration
The thing is I had already received the pink slip from the DMV so
I ignored it  I received another letter and then the phone calls
started coming  First from the finance guy and then from the general
manager both hounding me for the extra money  They left me alone
once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause
in the contract that stated that the final price was just that FINAL
Afterall they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another
 off after the deal had been signed right  I told them not 
to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future
They didn't seem to have a problem with that  This after all was a
used Ford at a Toyota dealership

I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month
ago  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month
It was even raining too so they had done very little business that 
weekend and were really willing to deal  I kept telling them I would
think about it and they kept dropping the price  Got a very good
deal and so far have been very please with the service

My Honda Accord just hit the magic  mile mark and now
all sorts of things are beginning to go bad The latest problem
I am experiencing is with my brakes  They still stop the
car fine but once I am stopped completely my brake pedal
will sink another  or  inches all by itself  If feels really
strange and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of
these days

I checked my brake fluid and the reservoir was full but the
fluid itself looked really dirty like dirty oil  I called
my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder
which will cost me a whopping 

I was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this
sort of thing  If so is my mechanic being honest Or do I
simply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in

Any help you could provide would be appreciated  Please send
replies directly to me as I rarely have a chance to read this
list  I will post the responses if there is any interest

Thanks

With the popularity of minivans the market room for station wagons is 
squeezed out They are not as comfortable as sedan and don't carry as 
much as the minivans 

This is not to say nobody wants the wagon anymore But the demand is certainly
hampered by the minivan and may not be economical to build a product for

 After too many years of school I'm finally graduating and getting a real
 job  Of course I am trying to make plans of how to spend all this extra
 money  Right now I have an  accord a good car but not real sporty 
 I was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around
 k on a sports car of some kind  After thinking about it I may have a
 better idea  I'll keep the Accord until it drops and buy the car I've
 always wanted  a Corvette Stingray My reasoning is that  accord
  corvette  is less than what I would spend anyway
 
 Basically I'm thinking of a late 's early 's for around k
 My question is what are good years to consider for reliability looks
 horsepower  in that order believe it or not horsepower is not a main
 concern if I want to go fast I get on my motorcycle and what are
 good prices
 
 Also what would insurance look like  I'm male single  I might
 wait until I'm  to get the car  lower insurance Would the fact that
 I mainly drive the other car lower it  Is there some type of classic
 car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under k miles
 per year
 
     My dad has a  vette and its on what you say 'classic insurance'
     Basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving
     time which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would
     probably suit your needs for limited mileage
  

        In my area Denver if you look around alittle you can get an
     for  or less not much less You said your not looking
    to go fast they are a really nice car just not real powerful
In addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also require
that the vehicle be garaged when not in use

mean huge tax increases as municipalities tried to make up for the

	Oh right  Only  dollar cars should be driven fast

My whole point was not to say that the cars couldn't go that fast
but that they shouldn't go that fast  A family sedan designed to be
operable at mph doesn't suddenly become operable at mph because
you added some plastic aero effects slightly wider tires and a much
larger engine  That's what the SHO is  a slightly modified family
sedan with a powerful engine  They didn't even bother improving the
brakes

The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO  a big power
plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications
I have reallife experience with the Mustang  it handles like a
brick except when you're invoking oversteer of course something I
personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is
inadequate even from mph  Lots of accelleration  but the rest of
the car is not up to par

I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in
mind  It didn't have to be the   it could have been the much
cheaper  or one of several Mercedes or Audi models  All of these
cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them
drivable at high speed  This should be elementary

There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought
it up  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but I believe
the following to be true

 Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here
 The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than
   they are here and usually include animal fences  This makes them
   far more predictable than most US highways
 Not all of Europe is the Autobahn  Most places in Europe have
   speed limits that aren't outofline with what we used to have in
   the US  if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not
   much higher than kmh

I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing mph
nearly kmh on the Autobahn but I could be wrong  Some people
have no respect for their own lives

You certainly haven't convinced me

	Of course not  Speedingisbad  Speedingisillegal 
Iwillnotspeed  IloveBigBrother  You had your mind made up

If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my postings

 Hello
 
 	Does anyone know how to take out the bolt under the engine
 compartment  Should I turn clockwise or counter  I tried any kind
 of lubricants WDetc but I still failed
 	Do you think I can use a electric drill change to a suitable
 bit  to turn it out  If I can succeed can I retighten it not too
 tight is it safe without oil leak
 Thank you very much in advance  Winson

  I would suggest you take the car to the nearest Chevron dealer with
your own oil and filter  Ask for an oil change  It will cost less
than   Watch himher do it  Just from watching someone do a job
you will be able to learn and remember the sequence and do it right
when you do it yourself the next time  Besides when heshe loosens
the drain nut the next time around it will be easier for you

  If it is stuck use an impact wrench  Not too much force though
Use a new washer each time you put the nut back

One thing that everyone is forgetting in this argument
over the pricing of the SC vs the Japanese cars is
the Saturns nodicker sticker  This makes the Saturn's
price low in comparison to the inflated base prices of
the Japanese competition on paper but in reality one
could dicker several hundred dollars off the price of
the Japanese cars

Admittedly though here in Canada at least the SC 
is in the same price class as the Civic Si not the
SC

Driving  in a straight line is fine you very soon become aclimated 
to it It's only a rush when there are corners that you don't
think you can make

On a clear autobahn  is nothing In the US  of people and
all judges would label you insane and it is difficult to persuade
people otherwise

Sure but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface
isn't much different to a typical TX freeway They are better
in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc I'd have
no problem driving  on most US freeways as it is I save it
for the backroads which really are more likely to be dangerous

than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at  will kill you at  Don't get me wrong I love to

It would have to be quite severe I don't recall any US freeway
without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe
at  in any decent well damped car Note that my definition
of decent well damped would exclude most typical American sedans

drive quickly and they say my Probe will do  but that's  more
than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece
of road hereabouts

I don't know where you live but I would be much more worried
about cops other traffic etc than the road surface at 
It just isn't that fast or that dangerous If you have a Probe
GT no problem The cyl models I have driven would be
likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds

	Wasn't the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he
could see where he was backing up  Although reverse lights on the sides

No reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up They
aren't bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail
lights 

are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the
path of the car I don't think warnings were their original intents since they
are colored white

Well red and orange were already taken Maybe white defines the direction
that the car is moving in


If you really want to be able to see behind you get some fog lamps for
the back of the car These work very well  and are a good way to get
rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone

 This is a twosided problem Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time
 The breeding of these lowlife's is getting worse our justice system is at best
 extremely weak to handle these problems That is why lowabiding citizens should have
 the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary 
 anywhere a threat is imminent
 
 My Camaro my pride and joy got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back
 The persons that did that were eventually caught lucky for me but not before
 having trashed the car
 
 On another occasion on my way from Texas to Florida I had stopped in a small motel
 for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida About  youths were disturbing my
 car setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out When I and another tenant
 walked out with a  Magnum and a  automatic respectively they vanished 
 Needless to say I immediately packedup and left
 
 Watch out for carjacking and staged accidents They can be deadly
 
I'm not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but I would ask you if 
you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
alarm  I can think of worse things in the world  Glad you got out of there
before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun

We can all ask what's happening to society these days but don't forget to
ask another important question too What effort am I expending to make it any
different than it is

Just my thoughts

Excuse me but I understood what Mr Smith meant  AND I have often observed 
when traffic is blocked solid that if a few people yeild to the moron
who is impatiently riding bumpers the slug at the front of the pack will
miraculously wake up change lanes and viola no more jam  Granted the
situation here does not apply to rush hour in a crowded city  But I have
observed this situation regularly on your average interstate six or 
eight sets of cars side by side bunched up in a pack with open 
freeway fore and aft as far as you can see  The people who refuse to
yeild as a point of honor are just as annoying as the slug in the front

I agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might
not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you don't want to
give them that one carlength when they should just wait like you are
BUT if you're one of those people that just sit's behind the person and
doesn't flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or
ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to 
go by and you're not just drafting them then get the hell out of the 
way of someone who will  I especially hate it when you flash someone at
the back of a line and they don't 'pass it on'  

So after I've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't
'pass it on' and few if any do what next On major highways  or more
lanes in each direction keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who
are entering Also as someone posted in this thread here in the DC
area we have a few left lane exits sounds like  If you wait until
the last minute to get in the left lane you won't cause these yoyos
won't make room

We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin
John bridge There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurryup
yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead When we get to the point
where these ramps merge all hell breaks lose The result is that traffic
which was moving at  on the VA side of the bridge stalls on t'other
side If these dingbats had stayed in lane allowed the folks coming up
the two ramps to merge we would still be doing  Instead we do start
stop for  miles Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be
real useful here

Bob

PS If you drive the beltway and want to merge look for a brown Probe
with a silver haired driver then use your signals  I don't read minds
but I do try to be courteous They told me courtesy was contagious but
I guess the folks around here have had their shots

I know that this isn't the group for it but since you brought it up
does anyone have any idea why they haven't bombed the Waco cult    

Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all
testified that the BATF shot first they they did not identify themselves
before tossing in concussion grenades not that anyone inside could have
heard such identification after being near a concussion grenade and
the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under
which they were operating  which was a search warrant by the way
not an arrest warrant  In short perhaps because the BATF is wildly
out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a
compound full of woman and children will not improve their position
There is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove selfdefense
in court  That will leave  what  four officers dead and no one to
blame but the BATF

It shouldn't be THAT hard if you know much about digital electronics  If the

the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in
and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh you'd also have
to know what the conventions are for low and high  It might be a little more
involved than this but it shouldn't be beyond someone with a BSEE or BS EET
All the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using
a translation table stored in ROM


Nobody is using discrete IC's to do these functions anymore if at
all  I doubt any of the Motor electronics had any to start with
Much less TTL

I can almost guarantee that it'll a fruitless attempt to figure out
how BMW does it without breaking anything and invalidating any

cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly
a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
in the head by one of the larger rocks  I don't recall if she 
made it but I think she was comatose for a month or so and 
doctors weren't holding out hope that she'd live

	The girl's OK actually and she recovered well enough to go home  I
don't know if she has any permanent damage though  Just in case anybody was
concerned


What the hell is happening to this great country of ours  I
can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
 pound rocks  Has our society really stooped this low

Erik velapold

	If people start forcing others to take responsibility for their actions
things like this wouldn't happen  Untill we stop blaming outside causes and
start blaming the criminals we will continue to let things like this happen

Last night I had a dream that my dad bought a Viper
I took it out for a test drive without his knowledge
and had to push it all the way home just to avoid a ticket
Wierd dream I wonder what it means

You do have the power Steve You can do it Why don't you Why don't you
go shoot some kids who are tossing rocks onto cars Make sure you do a good
job though  don't miss  'cause like they have big rocks  and take it from
me  those kids are mean

	As a stong selfdefense advocate you're 'statement' does littel
but irk me  Of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your
car is out of the question but what if they disabled your car with their
rock and then wanted to come killraperobbeat or otherwise harm you
your wife kids  
	I think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation
wouldn't you  Or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers
more than your own or those of your family  
	Don't think it couldn't happen to you  From the sounds of it here
it has happened to a few people  

	Please do not misunderstand  The only justification for using
deadly force on someone is that if you don't it will mean your own

Yes I have the same questions What makes me upset is that R costs are
skyrocketing and in fact can't be bought anymore in my area  Also this is yet
another way mechanics and dealers can RIPOFF customers Also I was reading
that the new refrigerant is not compatible with the r system and that it
would cost   upto a   to retrofit a car with the old R system
ALthough it is important to consider the environment I think the sudden ban is
a slap in the face for the consumer Why is it that the consumer should have
to pay for the retrofit The auto companies should have seen this coming Also
why is it that the governments of the world were so quick in banning freon use
and yet so slow in banning gasoline In my opinion gasoline is just as
hazardous as anything else  Why can't they start proposing bans on this and
switch to natural gas or electric The technology is there Hopefully some
chemist will come up with another alternative coolant that will be compatible
with the old system

	Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for
R  You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society
MACS that is the people who stand to rake in that  to  per
retrofit per automobile have mounted an organized campaign to squash those
R substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether on very shaky
technical grounds at best on outright lies at worst

	Does this piss you off  Yes  Write a letter to your congressman to
your senator to the president to the EPA and to the DOT and complain

How hard is a carb rebuild for moderately experienced backyard mechanic
I've done my clutch and miscellaneous little engine fixes

The hardest part is usually getting the darned thing off the intake
manifold  Rebuilding a carb is fun if you're into things with
lots of little parts  I used to rebuild them for all my friends'
cars in high school so it doesn't take a PhD  Buy a carb rebuilding
kit from an auto supply store  Buy a gallon of the best carb cleaning
solvent you can find do they still make Tyme  as a rule of thumb
buy the one with the scariest warning labels  Put it into a metal
bucket  Make yourself a dipping can by punching holes in the bottom of
a coffee can and attaching a wire handle to it  If the carb cleaner
doesn't strip the paint right off the coffee can you're not
using the right stuff  Use the can to soak the little stuff and
just hang the big parts from a coat hanger  Wash them off with a
garden hose wipe off excess water with paper towels and air dry
Then remember where all the little parts go  Follow the rebuild
kit's instructions concerning float height choke tension etc
Bolt it back on the engine and admire the superclean carb on the
filthy engine

	Heed this man's warnings  If you get carb cleaner this strong on
your hands your hands will be eaten away  Not pretty  Hence the dipping
can method

Why crawl under the car at all I have a machine I got for my boat that 
pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube It does an
excellent job and by moving the suction tube around you can get more 
old oil out than by using the drain plug I think I paid  at EB Marine
The oil goes into a steel  gal can  wait until it cools and decant into
your favorite device I use soft drink bottles Easy to take them down to
the local oil recycle center

However if I were to design a BMW's electronics I will use a counter to 
count the number of times the car passed  million miles or whatever and 
store it in the car computer's memory This could be read when doing a 
diagnostics test Ditto for the date of the odometer As easy as this is I 
don't know why manafucturers don't do it don't they to prevent illegal 
odometer tampering

But as a previous writer said it will in any case take aeons to reset an 
odometer mechanic or electronic by simulating a driving car It will be 
easier to reprogram it How I don't know

It shouldn't be THAT hard if you know much about digital electronics  If the
counter is made with standard TTL chips all you should need to do is find
the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in
and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh you'd also have
to know what the conventions are for low and high  It might be a little more
involved than this but it shouldn't be beyond someone with a BSEE or BS EET
All the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using
a translation table stored in ROM

selah

Dan

But those chips are probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller and
use less power and the presetdata pins are not going to be available
It would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS 
wider operating voltage range not that the tecnology would make 
much difference
Plus the custom chip would probably be potted encapsulated with epoxy
Good luck

I like my Wrangler but when doing some serious off roading it can't

stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted
The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO  a big power

The Mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the
SHO 
plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications
I have reallife experience with the Mustang  it handles like a
brick except when you're invoking oversteer of course something I

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because
of the suspension

personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is
inadequate even from mph  Lots of accelleration  but the rest of
the car is not up to par

Yes When i think Mustang I think schoolbus   F motor In
my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 
or so It just isn't safe check out your local junkyard Mustangs
outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in
junkyards

I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the
Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power Ford should at least
standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 's




I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in
mind  It didn't have to be the   it could have been the much
cheaper  or one of several Mercedes or Audi models  All of these
cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them
drivable at high speed  This should be elementary

There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought
it up  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but I believe
the following to be true

 Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here

True of Northern Europe latin countries are something else

 The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than
Kindof true remember they were build by adolf in the ''s

   they are here and usually include animal fences  This makes them
   far more predictable than most US highways

Yes

 Not all of Europe is the Autobahn  Most places in Europe have

Autobahn is the german word for freeway Other countries have
different names for loose equivalents autostrada autoroute motorway
etc

   speed limits that aren't outofline with what we used to have in
   the US  if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not
   much higher than kmh

Europe did seem on the brink of a kmh limit It hasn't passed as
far as I know typical speeds in western europe are much higher than
the US Law enforcement is negligible in my experience comapred
to the US as there is no revenue enhancement motivation The things
you really notice are the higher speed differentials and the more
professional attitude to driving You just never see two cars
running parallel at  mph oblivious to all around them


I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing mph
nearly kmh on the Autobahn but I could be wrong  Some people

You're wrong GTI's  go this fast Just kind of noisy not the ideal

autobahn car A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers
foot on the floor How do I know  when you're not making any ground
on the identical car in front of you

have no respect for their own lives

If something happens at  you're dead but the same goes for much
over  Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate I feel much
safer driving  on the autobahn than  in typical US traffic
because most people seem to be awake I've never seen any driver reading
a book on an autobahn I see it all too often in the US

Craig

It just doesn't seem fast after  minutes or so of aclimation everybody
drives that fast no big deal 

Craig

You certainly haven't convinced me

RT had an article on cars of the SC ilk and they liked the Civic Ex
the Escort GT and the MX best of all and the SC was way down the

I just looked at that article first of all this summary is inaccurate
of  cars the SC was th right behind these mentioned and the Suzuki
Swift  As has been pointed out it was a semisilly comparison the
Saturn was at least  cheaper than the MX and Escort admittedly
negligible but an issue and  less than the Honda The stated
goal was a base under k the Honda was  over while the SC at
the same price was excluded In other words they let the best Honda
play but not the best Saturn  Note that the Saturn did beat the k

I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest
assured that the street prices for the MX and Escort and maybe even
the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about
All price comparisons I've seen are based on MSRP and of course the
saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others
will do it way below sticker

This just a warning to EVERYBODY on the net  Watch out for
folks standing NEXT to the road or on overpasses   They can
cause SERIOUS HARM to you and your car  

just a cliffnotes version of my story follows

pm last night I was travelling on the interstate here in
knoxville  I was taking an offramp exit to another interstate
and my wife suddenly screamed and something LARGE hit the side
of my truck  We slowed down but after looking back to see the
vandals standing there we drove on to the police station

She did get a good look at the guy and saw him cock his arm with
something the size of a cinderblock BUT I never saw him We are 
VERY lucky the truck sits up high on the road if it would have hit
her window it would have killed her 

The police are looking for the guy but in all likelyhood he is gone 

I am a very good driver knock on wood but it was nighttime and
I never saw the guy  The police said they thought the motive was to
hit the car have us STOP to check out the damage and then JUMP US
and take the truck  

PLEASE BE AWARE OF FOLKS  AND FOR YOUR OWN GOOD PLEASE DON'T STOP

peace

As long as we're on the subject Several years ago myself and two others
were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 
north of Seattle WA Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
windshield Not by accident I'm sure it was impossible to get up to the
overpass quickly to see who did it We figured it was kids reported it and
left
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company He was
in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away They caught the  year old
that did it They put a cover over the overpass what else could they do
I don't think I'll over forget this story

in the area of reliability and maintenanability
Please send email to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net

My opinion about this car is you get a lot for

their problem I wasn't giving them any more money The finance guy then  
brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time I  
reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  
treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  
deal He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it  
snatched back my check and left Needless to say they were not pleased by  
the turn of events

That's nothing  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small
sedan a few years ago she brought me along as a token male so
the salespeople wouldn't give her the bimbo treatment
Her first choice was a Mazda  and second choice was a Nissan
Sentra  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what we
wanted  We started negotiating on the price and the salesdroid
kept playing the let me run this price by the sales manager  After
playing the good salesman bad salesman game we finally told him
that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price perhaps
we should be speaking directly to someone who did  He brought in
the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick
in the book  Read Remar Sutton's Don't Get Taken Every Time for a
list  Finally after playing a few more rounds of you'll have to
work with us on this price also known as each time you come up a
thousand dollars we'll come down ten the salesmanager gave a signal to
his two sales cronies stood up and said well we can't come down any
more so I guess we can't help you and they trouped out of the room
leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves  Hmm
I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they
can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer and
I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering
why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the
door  For lack of anything better to do I picked up the phone on
the desk and called another Mazda dealership asked for a salesman
and began discussing what kind of price they would consider  A few
sentences into the conversation Mr Salesmanager broke into the line
 and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call
another dealership from his phone  I said that since he'd announced
that our business was over he shouldn't care and every time I tried
to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our
voices with his own  How did he know that I was using the phone
anyway  Finally I hung up and we headed out of the showroom
Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he
begins to berate us again  We say that we won't bother him anymore
we're going next door to the Nissan dealership

Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped  As we go out
the front door the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom
customers and all Go ahead  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan
So my friend bought a Sentra

Just so the guilty won't go unpunished I'll mention that the
sales manager's name was Gary Tusone  From his manner his
refusal to come down to a reasonable price and his anger at the
end my guess is that he had bet our original salesman who was
a young novice that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of
us and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks

I was following an example of the LH the other day and noticed the fit
between the tunk lid and the rear bumper   The gap was quite small on
the left side but much larger on the right  Blech

Driving  in a straight line is fine you very soon become aclimated 
to it It's only a rush when there are corners that you don't
think you can make

On a clear autobahn  is nothing In the US  of people and
all judges would label you insane and it is difficult to persuade
people otherwise

Sure but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better
than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at  will kill you at  Don't get me wrong I love to
drive quickly and they say my Probe will do  but that's  more
than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece
of road hereabouts

  Hi Me and My roomate are going to redecorate the living room and 
we thought it would be a cool idea to have a license plate from every 
state in the US and then from whereever else we could find like canada
Mexixo even some European ones

  If anyone has any ideas or knows someone that could help us out
please let me know  The more recent the better but anything
would be nice

  Either that or if you have an old plate hanging around hint hint

I wish I had the figures with me to back me up but I recall
statistics showing that women tended to have more accidents than men
but the damage was generally quite minor  Men had fewer but far more
expensive accidents  The rate of total vehicle destruction was
significantly higher for men than women particularly in the younger
male age groups

IMHO social considerations are probably the strongest influence here
possibly more so than any difference between the sexes  Social
influences often affect the type of car that's bought and the
situations the car is used in and the type of car and driving
situations have a major effect on accident risk  Thus if society
expects you to buy a Mustang and race it on the street you're more
likely to do it and our society expects that of males more than
females

I agree with some of your social influences such as driving conditions
but lets get real here  Guys don't drag race becuase there expected too
we do it becuase its fun  and we find out whose car is faster  
Guys drive different than women becuase there men  When a driver is  
driving 'unusually' I can usually figure out if it is a male or female
driver without looking at the driver
Social influences may give a person more reason to buy a vehicle that
has a certain amount of character which he or she would like associated
with  Do you change your driving habits when no one is around

Sheesh I don't know what kind of women they have where you guys live
but there are some ladies here who will blow your doors off Or at least
they will try to but we just can't let the youngsters get too uppity

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut It works great 
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every  miles
Works for me I must say 


I did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons  I was wondering
how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear
that somebody might steal my airfilter

Oh come on Silly all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and 
put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole  What do you
think all those big air intake things are for on those hotrod cars
They're just for looks onlylittle does anyone know they provide
access to the oilfill hole

Well over where we live we have problems with vandals stealing 
people's wheels  Those locking nuts didn't stop them  So to be
safe and sure I welded the lug nuts to my wheels together  It
works serious  I haven't had my wheels stolen yet

This just a warning to EVERYBODY on the net  Watch out for
folks standing NEXT to the road or on overpasses   They can
cause SERIOUS HARM to you and your car  

just a cliffnotes version of my story follows

pm last night I was travelling on the interstate here in
knoxville  I was taking an offramp exit to another interstate
and my wife suddenly screamed and something LARGE hit the side
of my truck  We slowed down but after looking back to see the
vandals standing there we drove on to the police station

She did get a good look at the guy and saw him cock his arm with
something the size of a cinderblock BUT I never saw him We are 
VERY lucky the truck sits up high on the road if it would have hit
her window it would have killed her 

The police are looking for the guy but in all likelyhood he is gone 
Stuff deleted

I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport
for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the
freeway  Several persons were killed when said blocks came through
their windshields  Many overpass bridges are now fenced and they
have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges as if that would stop
such people  Yet many bridges are NOT fenced  I always look up at a
bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this
sport has not reached us here in Fresno

While not exactly a service incident I had a similar experience recently  
when I bought a new truck

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  
agreed on a price I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck  
When I returned I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  
get to me When I finally got in there everything went smoothly until he  
started adding up the numbers He then discovered that they had  
miscalculated the tax  license by about  

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers  Last month my brother bought 
a new Audi  series quatro from a local dealer  They came back with the 
final price tax and all and he added it up for himself  There happened to 
be an extra  tagged on under the tax part He pointed out their error 
and asked them to rethink their addition  They came back with the right 
price the next time

the same I would have expected The Cizeta was not only the slowest of

of smoking brakes For a sportscar it showed ridiculous performance

Hm I find this hard to believe  VT weights about the same as
the Red Head but it has hell lot more horse power  Perhaps it's
due to preproduction glitches  Well to me it still got the most

Hi maybe someone can help me here
I am looking to buy this  Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN right now
The car has  km or about  miles on it
A typical mileage for  cars seem to be about  km or about K mi
The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification
he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced
to meet the legal standards  He said he will replace the components before
selling the car to me

Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars I don't know
what this could mean
Is K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items
Or is this an indication that the car was abused
Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon
The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot but
I don't know how to verify this  I've seen the paint chipped away
in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood though

Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and
well kept it's currently out of warranty
a similarly priced ' Accord with K km will have  years or K km
worth of warranty left and I don't want to worry about paying for
any repair bills
But I also need a car for  people  

When will the new Maxima come out by the way

I would very much appreciate your input in this
Please reply by email preferred or post in this newsgroup
Thanks

RT had an article on cars of the SC ilk and they liked the Civic Ex
the Escort GT and the MX best of all and the SC was way down the
list except for braking

I just looked at that article first of all this summary is inaccurate
of  cars the SC was th right behind these mentioned and the Suzuki
Swift  As has been pointed out it was a semisilly comparison the
Saturn was at least  cheaper than the MX and Escort admittedly
negligible but an issue and  less than the Honda The stated
goal was a base under k the Honda was  over while the SC at
the same price was excluded In other words they let the best Honda
play but not the best Saturn  Note that the Saturn did beat the k

I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest
assured that the street prices for the MX and Escort and maybe even
the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about
All price comparisons I've seen are based on MSRP and of course the
saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others
will do it way below sticker

	I'd hate to rehash an old thread but  Would someone kindly quote
a prices that a dealer quotes for a Civic EX and Escort GT  Also I'm a
assuming that the MX was the V so go ahead and look that up too  If 
someone has one of those yearly buyers' guides that give a low quote price
please quote them too  Then find the the SC base price

Both my pastor's late model Corolla and my father's  Stanza
have demonstrated the falling door seals problem

As unfair as it may seem the difference between Chrysler and Toyota is
that Chrysler needs to prove that it can build quality cars Toyota can
afford make a few small mistakes without hurting the image

After all door seal failing on a year old Stanza is not comparable to 
the same problem on a brand new Intreprid

I don't know about trains but I've saw a sign on the back of a
Greyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off
It doesn't explain why but it does set off my radar detector

Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their
RADAR collisionprevention system They use RADAR to monitor how close
other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are and signals
a warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast
or are getting too close

This is all I remember from the news reports a few months back at
the time they were only talking about the possibility of installing
the system They didn't mention how it worked in bumpertobumper
traffic or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at
mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached 
at mph on a curve

I do recall something about progressive stages of warnings from
flashing lights to audible warningsie it goes from a red Too

 Watch out for carjacking and staged accidents They can be deadly
 
I'm not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but I would ask you if 
you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
alarm  I can think of worse things in the world  Glad you got out of there
before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun

If I hear someone screwing with my car ie setting off the alarm and
taunting me to come out you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite
will also be coming with me It's not the screwing with the car that'd
get them shot it's the potential physical danger If they're
taunting like that it's very possible that they also intend to rob
me andor do other physically harmful things

If they're just screwing around no harm done If they're bent on
mayhem they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency a
gr injection  fpsthere's no telling what today's violent
criminals will do Death may be the most pleasant outcome

Hi maybe someone can help me here
I am looking to buy this  Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN right now

So its an automatic Don't know if US specCDN spec for Maximas

The car has  km or about  miles on it
A typical mileage for  cars seem to be about  km or about K mi
The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification
he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced
to meet the legal standards  He said he will replace the components before
selling the car to me

Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars I don't know
what this could mean
Is K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items
Or is this an indication that the car was abused

If it is the first set of brake pads on front then this is fine My car
eats a set every k miles or so The fact that he is replacing the
muffler too is also ok

Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon

The mileage is fairly low  but typical fwd stuff is CV joints Check
the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve
adjustments timing belt changes and so on

The k mile service is often expensive so make sure he has done everything


The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot but
I don't know how to verify this  I've seen the paint chipped away
in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood though

Well this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a
car with highway miles 
Might check the gas pedal wear too Ask him how many sets of tires he
has been through A highway car might have squeezed by on  sets
a hard driven car  sets


Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and
well kept it's currently out of warranty
a similarly priced ' Accord with K km will have  years or K km
worth of warranty left and I don't want to worry about paying for
any repair bills

Well the Maxima should be pretty reliable  but if its out of warranty
you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first Stuff
for Japanese cars can be expensive

But I also need a car for  people  

When will the new Maxima come out by the way

 model year I believe 

I would very much appreciate your input in this
Please reply by email preferred or post in this newsgroup

Craig
Thanks

Ryan

No reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up They
aren't bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail
lights 

I don't know where you live but I couldn't get out of my driveway
at night without reverse lights As someone said out in the country
you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between
day and night At night around my house which is amongst a forest of
rather tall oaks it is DARK except for nights with full moons
Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up I greatly
prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights

 dealer had an ABS equipped SER  I went straight to the fleet manager
 at the dealership I liked told him what I wanted made him aware that I
 knew what his price should be  He called me back with exactly what I
 wanted from a dealer mi away I took delivery the next day 

When I was selling Nissans last summer I sold a ' SER in early August
  when its supply was getting quite scarce  The car was black with ABS 
  Value Option Pkg and power moonroof  I sold it for  plus tax
  Naturally my manager didn't really care to sell one of the most desirable

Craig

Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights
are for couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of
letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse
and that they can also light up the area behind your car while
you're backing up so you can see

Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used
to be on older cars Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright
enough to illuminate a good area behind the car and they're 
MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the s and s 

Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights look at a ' or '
model or perhaps a year or two earlier too and you'll see
red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the
car's hindquarters  Those aren't just white reflectors

CAR just tested the S wagon with  banger and  speed manual  Rave
review except for Servotronic  Audi is trying to recoup the
development costs for the V and since the V is not selling well
they are sticking it into the  series cars Neat marketing trick
eh  yeah a  Vv wouldn't be a bad idea as competition for the
upcoming bimmer i would it  maybe they can use a  liter
version to avoid conflicts with the v model then strip off all the
luxogarbage  let the S remain with the flared arches and fat tires
to go fight with the M maybe turn up the boost a wee bit to bump
bhp up to say  or so  while keeping the  V with mercedes

I have found a kit advertised for lowering the front end of an early 
mustang  Installation envolves moving the upper Aarm and installation 
of a wedge shaped spacer between the Aarm and ball joint  Apparently 
Shelby Mustangs did a similair modification but left out the spacer

I would be interested in feedback pro or con on such a modification

	I'm no mustang head but don't the early ones have a simple
strut suspension that is with no upper Aarm  Just a strut
going down to a lower control arm single bushing not an Aarm with a
tensioncompression rod locating it in the forwardbackward direction

	Anyway simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using
shorter springs cutting the springs lowering the spring perch or shortening
the strut below the perch  In each of these cases the suspension geometry
will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the
intended angle  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom
of the strut roughly the height of the reduction will restore
the suspension geometry  IMHO the kit that includes the spacer
is the only way to go

How do I square this with a respectable resale value  Easy if it's expensive

A patently false statement Try this logic on an Alfa  In fact 
marketplace has a wonderufl mechanism to adjust the value of the cars that 
are overpriced by the manufacturer If it is expensive to buy new it is NOT 
necessarily expnesive to buy used In fact it could be real cheap to buy 
used depending what that car is of course Note that I do not question your 
statements on the reliability of Wrangler I have never owned one driven one 
or been in one I do love to have one though


 What I don't understand is why 
this apparent neglect of quality for so many years has not filtered down into 
the used marketIs Jeep so intoxicating so irresistable and so seductive as 
to make its purchase a fatal attraction

Bijan



Yep  They are popular vehicles  You don't see a lot of previous model year
ones sitting on dealer's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are
out  The things sell they are popular

Because they are popular and highpriced new they are high price used very
simple

I knew they were overpriced when I bought it I knew they had a terrible 
reliability record when I bought it  But I didn't expect anything like I
got especially with a dealer network unable to repair it  Personal experience
has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine

There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought
it up  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but I believe
the following to be true

My knowledge about driving in the US is also secondhand but I think I can
correct your statements about our Autobahn

 Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here

Oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it From all I've
heard from my US relatives drivers esp here in Germany are much more agg
ressive but not disciplined One of my relatives a LA resident hired a car
at the Nuernberg airport and went about  miles to our home He said then that
he grew about  year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in
Germany again this was in  and he kept his promise  the situation now is
even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic
What you mean by better disciplined' should perhaps be considered cautious due
to fear' 
When driving around here you always have to take into consideration that the
majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you They expect that nobody
fails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can
go of course only where that is allowed you might think  dream on 
So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health  and if you're ex
posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn to
handle it  or you lose 
That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation  
whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you I think we handle
a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared to
the volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents  OTOH more and more
people esp women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatened
and each accident is one accident too much

 The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than
   they are here and usually include animal fences  This makes them
   far more predictable than most US highways

Better designed and maintained may be  but animal fences are very rare Auto
bahnen and many other streets have guardrails I hope that's the right word  
a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights it's about  feet high
those guardrails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road Smaller animals
can crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it The point is
that esp larger animals are very rare in Germany they tend also to be very
timid Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger

 Not all of Europe is the Autobahn  Most places in Europe have
   speed limits that aren't outofline with what we used to have in
   the US  if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not
   much higher than kmh

You're right there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn 
but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to that
in Germany I've been in France Switzerland Italy Austria Spain Belgium
the Netherlands  besides that you really can't rely on the residents abiding
the local speed limits I've got quite a lot of practise k miles and I'm
used to travel at  mph FYI with a car even smaller than a rabbit but I
consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill

I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing mph
nearly kmh on the Autobahn but I could be wrong 

Sorry but you'll find quite a lot rabbitclasscar or even smaller mine is a
Peugeot  owners going that fast small cars with much HP are very hip' over
here  and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run

                                                        Some people
have no respect for their own lives

I disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant Formula cars
weigh less than  kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at
 mph or higher  OTOH when crashing against a solid object at  mph
it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche a Mercedes a tank or on
a bicycle Your're dead

I too was puzzled by this obvious untruth What I think is going on is that
Nissan claims that the Altima is the best selling new car namelplate in
the US I think I have this near verbatim Lee Iaccoca's statistics
dept would have been proud of that sentence


Note that the CorollaPrism are also new designs but hey are not new 
nameplates  I guess Nissan doesn't even sell as many Altimas as
Toyota does Corollas or there would be no nameplate qualifier

Jeremy G Mereness zonkerCMUEDU says

Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford Probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

I am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something
a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power I
am considering the MX Probe Accord Corolla and the SX 

I bought a ' Probe GT with the PEP A last July now at  miles
after debating over the Sentra SERNX MX MR Stealth Prelude 
and Celica

The car design is different than earlier years so it's too early to see its
reliability so far  For what it's worth my comments

My dislikes
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal

Some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented 
about this problem but I haven't seen it happen on my  month old 
' Probe GT  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since 
the initial batch of cars  Also someone said that Ford has issued a 
service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you 
may be able to get your dealer to fix it

Headlights have stuck up a few times weather
air conditioning broke  miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely

Haven't seen any of these problems nor have I seen these mentioned on the
mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these

crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical

Definitely

parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not 
stitched properly  Hopefully just a fluke

No problems like these either  I haven't been able to find any obvious 
places where they screwed up

Ford only gives  key with the car  C'mon Ford spend an extra few pennies

Hmmm  I got two keys with my car  Something tells me you got stiffed by
your dealer on this  Actually if you count the credit card key that 
came in the owner's binder I got  keys but since the credit card key
doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet I guess I won't count it 

Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  I'm waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference

The latter is probably because of the air bag  It's pretty much takes up
all the space where you'd expect to find the horn

Speaking of the horn I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind
The previous Probes had Japanese horns

Tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 

Yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes

My Likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely 
handling very good for FWD understeer only at limits
transmission the  speed is a must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
Very little torque steer at full power much better than the ' SHO I drive
stability at mph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility in front
Heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather
ABSAir bag see above
rear seats fold down I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important
No shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
Tires VR Goodyear Eagles  left hoping for K 

I agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine  The
interior is very very nice too  Very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically
sound


I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the
Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes  When you test drive one find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is 
tolerable

Yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone  I personally like it
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car I'd strongly
suggest looking into the MX

If you have  passengers by all means bring them along too  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently if that's better is up to you  

The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room  Plenty of 
head room though  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints
so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to 
give them a place to put their feet

Also there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer  My back seat passengers now very few complain about
the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat

The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car 
I really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then I've always been a sucker
for open air driving  No leakage problems or anything like thatyet

I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine

I haven't heard about this one  I know that some of the very early Probes
' and maybe ' had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which
Ford will replace at no charge but I haven't heard about anything like
this concerning the ' Probes

I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot
that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even
gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my
car  I was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering
that I was expecting the worst from them

From what I've heard it sounds like FordMazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe and probably MX when they first went into production but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  That's
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though

Hope this helps

Hello netters

I'm visiting the US I'm from Sweden in August I will probably rent a Chevy
Beretta from Alamo I've been quoted  for a week  for additional days 
This would include free driving distance but not local taxes Baltimore 
They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but I doubt that
 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than what's included in the base price But on the other hand he didn't
rent it from Alamo

Does anyone have some info on this

Is  a ripoff 
Probability that I'll be needing more insurance
Is the beretta a good rental car

Thanx

Markus

Ashtrays and cigarette lighters  These should be an option

GM at least is heading in that direction  One of the postsale
questions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette
liter or an accessory plug and another whether I'd like the choice of
an ashtray or a cup holder

The ' Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option
which did not exist in the ' I bought  I'm not sure about the
ash tray vs cup holder  It's a step in the right direction

The ashtray does make a convenient changeholder so it's not
completely useless

Alright beat this automobile sighting

Driving along just a hair north of Atlanta I noticed an old run down
former car dealership which appeared to deal with and repair older
rare or exotic foreign sports cars I saw

Ford GT  the famous model from Ford that seemed to win most of 
its races in the late s including LeMans  or  times

Two Jensen Interceptors one a convertable one a hatchback

Porsche  boring compared to the rest

THREE Ferarries a Mondial a  prepared for racing and a red s model
that I couldn't identify

And at the bottom a late s MG convertable

Outside there was a rotting Rover  saloon which was never regularly
sold in the US

And in the showroom there was a small italian body either an Alpha Romeo
or a Lancia It was about the size of an Austin Mini
The trunklid was missing exposing a boot with a voltage regulator 
in the upper left corner of the wall and a chunk of metal removed from
the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk
and go to the outside from here
The taillights looked like they
would be the round type if they were there Does anyone know what the
make of this one is  

Certainly made my day

       The restriction could have to do with the car being a convertible

A lot of paronoid laws were passed concerning convertibles in the 's
These states may require greater rollover protection than the Capri affords

Well the MGB is currently in production for the English market built

Thanx to all those who responded particularly those never driven an XXX
but here's what it's like guys

OK we all know that newage AT's are great in traffic and do a satisfactory
job in acceleration when you keep your foot buried in the carpet

My question regards downshifting  NOT downshifting to pass AT's are 
good at this now but manually moving the lever to   or  at a point
where you would downshift a manual eg approaching a red light or a 
curve or just tooling around a parking lot in st or nd wo shifting
This is why I'm still a ManualTrans Bigot the downshifting for
deceleration seems so natural  When I try this in an automatic the
tranny doesn't seem to understand what I want

Addendum isn't it great after downshifting while approaching that
red light when the light goes green and you're already oncam
or the turbo's already spooled up  zippppppppppp

i have a grand am with auto and quad  around the gear selector there is a 
plastic strip which covers the space so you can't see inside  anywayi took
the cover off and cut the end of this long strip to a specific length the 
strip curls up into a cirlce at one end inside  anyway by doing this the 
strip can't feed into the lip that circles itsoi can push button pull
down and the gear shifter will only go back to  from driveno accidental
hitting first  i drive around town in  to keep the revs up  shift to drive
above  and pull down to  when coming up to lightsif i want  if i am
eating foodi drive in drive  there are probably aftermarket shift kits
that will accomplish the same thing  porsche's tiptronic automatic can be 
driven like an autoor put into  mode  tip upupshifttip down
downshift  of course there is an override so you don't redline the engine

Is it worthwhile to get an alarm system on a new car


Although others have in the past and will continue to disagree
i think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm


What features are important

I think that it is important to protect your trunk engine bay all
doors  I'd get flashing lights LED's mounted on the drivers and
passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation Toss in 
a glass break sensor and shock sensor Door lock and unlock
two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have

Most important is where you have the installation done  Some places
may cost a little more but a poorly installed alarm no matter how
much it cost will be a major burden


What features are unimportant

IMO things like engine starters voice alarms windowsunroof open
and close and most other conveniences

Could we plase cease this discussion  I fail to see why people feel the need 
to expound upon this issue for days and days on end  These areas are not
 meant for this type of discussion  If you feel the need to do such things
 please take your thought elsewhere  Thanks
 
   Exactly my point  There is a lot of hostility to and from teenagers

   If you follow the news for the northwest USA you will have heard that a
 group of year old boys barely out of the teens certainly their outlook
 was developed during their teens just shot and killed an innocent little
 girl riding in a car in the Seattle area when her mother who was driving
 honked her horn at the car with the boys in it  This is really upsetting
 and makes my stomach turn as it would any parent's   Doesn't your heart
 just go out to that poor mother
   Teenagers both drive cars and are involved in automotive vandalism and
 crime  Maybe someone on this newsgroup has had specific experience in
 dealing with violent teenage offenders like these kids are  At the same

It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a
case of violence by teenagers

For a little perspective

How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children seniors the homeless

Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring
breaks helping out in inner city areas What about the hundreds of
volunteers  teenagers and others who worked to clean up the mess
after the Rodney King riots in LA

Have you gone to your local high school play recently Attended the
school orchestra performances Have you seen how many kids volunteer
to pick up trash plant trees do walkathons How many kids have
tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to How
many girl scout cookies have you bought How many chocolate bars for
good causes

The media picks up on all the anomalies the sensational

What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at
school get good grades go to college or to work and make a real
contribution to our society

All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives Mother Theresa
was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer

It is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational
reporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today
It is a reflection of what is happening on the outer fringes of our
society and nothing more

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live 
If you live in a place where crime is apparent then it might be a good idea to
get one simply as a deterrent  However if a professional thief wants your
vehicle its as good as gone no matter what you do  But to slow down any
thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options  That would be

	ignition kill or fuel cutoff
	a flashing red LED

These two are basic to a decent alarm system  
To slow down the criminal some more get a steering wheel lock
That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target
But then there's always carjacking  
Why is life so confusing
I hope I helped somewhat

It did it again  This morning my  Ford Ranger was idling at  RPM
Ok so I exaggerated a little but it was idling very fast  It has a 
liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would
cause the idle to drop back to normal I don't think the linkage is stuck
What can I do to fix this problem  This has been a problem from time to
time but has straightened itself out  until now  I don't have a tach
but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast
as it should be  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up
at a stop light

Many thanks for any suggestions

Jeremy G Mereness zonkerCMUEDU says

Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford Probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

I am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something
a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power I
am considering the MX Probe Accord Corolla and the SX 

The Probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions
But every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value
BTW the SX is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for  

Thanks in Advance

While I don't read normally read this group I was looking for Valentine radar
information sigh maybe in the FAQ and came across your posting

I bought a ' Probe GT with the PEP A last July now at  miles
after debating over the Sentra SERNX MX MR Stealth Prelude 
and Celica

Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records  

My criteria a fun car with ABS airbag over hp and less than K
I thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out
The TriStar cars EclipseTalonetc were out since they don't have an air bag
Ditto for the Mustangalso no ABS
The SERNXM fell into the pocketrocket category  A good used car buy
The MX was almost there but rolled more than I liked  
I didn't like the Prelude dashinstrumentation at all  Too weird for me
The MR has a much smaller nonpassenger space than I needed so out that went
The Celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat
overpriced too in nonturbo form
I never considered the SX since it didn't have an airbag  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but that's it  The Corolla never entered my mind
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VRDodge Stealth more
Since my list was exhausted I bought the Probe  

The car design is different than earlier years so it's too early to see its
reliability so far  For what it's worth my comments

My dislikes
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal
Headlights have stuck up a few times weather
air conditioning broke  miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely
crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not 
stitched properly  Hopefully just a fluke
Ford only gives  key with the car  C'mon Ford spend an extra few pennies
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  I'm waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference
Tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 

My Likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely 
handling very good for FWD understeer only at limits
transmission the  speed is a must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
Very little torque steer at full power much better than the ' SHO I drive
stability at mph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility in front
Heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather
ABSAir bag see above
rear seats fold down I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important
No shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
Tires VR Goodyear Eagles  left hoping for K 

As you can see I'm primarily interested in the engine  While it doesn't
have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling
point for me was the allaluminum  value  liter engine  

The overall car is a good buy for the money  That market segment hasn't changed
much since July Prelude VTEC Honda Del Sol  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the
Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes  When you test drive one find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable
If you have  passengers by all means bring them along too  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently if that's better is up to you  Also there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer  My back seat passengers now very few complain about
the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine
Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so
I can't comment on them I got the car before it was officially announced  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway  

I wouldn't want this car in the snow  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes tires aren't meant for snow and the seats assume
that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing  Rain is much better  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles and I was really trying  
There is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door but they're rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CD's max  The center consolestorage binarm
rest has  cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch
but that's it  No change holders  Quite a letdown from the SHO
And the Probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car

Lastly don't store wet car covers in the back  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will not smell pleasant

 This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway
 Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
 throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  Four or five
 cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly
 a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
 in the head by one of the larger rocks  I don't recall if she 
 made it but I think she was comatose for a month or so and 
 doctors weren't holding out hope that she'd live
 
 What the hell is happening to this great country of ours  I
 can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
  pound rocks  Has our society really stooped this low
 
 Erik velapold
 
 Society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams The basic reason
 is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
 No Big Deal Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV we can abort 
 children on demand and kill the sick and old at will So why be surprised
 when some kids drop  lbs rocks and kill people They don't care because the
 message they hear is Life is Cheap
 
 AT

Well people fortunatly or unfortunatly 
only the US is experiencing the devaluation of human life among 
developed nations

I am an American but I was raised in Europe where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into or have his pocket
picked by Slaves or Russian refugees

Of cource there will be some nutcases but thats extremely rare

Ie in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying

In Germany  you can walk the sidewalks at  am and not even look 
behind your back at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen

Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying

I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere

Of course these postings sould be in soccultureUS but if we reduce
crime here it 'll mean less car insurance rates thus we could spend
more money on modifing our cars Now my posting is recautostech 
revelant

 Why crawl under the car at all I have a machine I got for my boat that 
 pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube It does an
 excellent job and by moving the suction tube around you can get more 
 old oil out than by using the drain plug I think I paid  at EB Marine
 The oil goes into a steel  gal can  wait until it cools and decant into
 your favorite device I use soft drink bottles Easy to take them down to
 the local oil recycle center

This does sound good but I heard it tends to leave more grit etc in the 
oil pan  Also I've been told to change the old when it's hot before the
grit has much time to settle

Any opinions

 This just a warning to EVERYBODY on the net  Watch out for
 folks standing NEXT to the road or on overpasses   They can
 cause SERIOUS HARM to you and your car  
 
 just a cliffnotes version of my story follows
 
 pm last night I was travelling on the interstate here in
 knoxville  I was taking an offramp exit to another interstate
 and my wife suddenly screamed and something LARGE hit the side
 of my truck  We slowed down but after looking back to see the
 vandals standing there we drove on to the police station
 
 She did get a good look at the guy and saw him cock his arm with
 something the size of a cinderblock BUT I never saw him We are 
 VERY lucky the truck sits up high on the road if it would have hit
 her window it would have killed her 
 
 The police are looking for the guy but in all likelyhood he is gone 
 
 I am a very good driver knock on wood but it was nighttime and
 I never saw the guy  The police said they thought the motive was to
 hit the car have us STOP to check out the damage and then JUMP US
 and take the truck  
 
 PLEASE BE AWARE OF FOLKS  AND FOR YOUR OWN GOOD PLEASE DON'T STOP
 
 peace

 As long as we're on the subject Several years ago myself and two others
 were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 
 north of Seattle WA Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
 windshield Not by accident I'm sure it was impossible to get up to the
 overpass quickly to see who did it We figured it was kids reported it and
 left
 A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company He was
 in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children Turned out there was
 a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away They caught the  year old
 that did it They put a cover over the overpass what else could they do
 I don't think I'll over forget this story

In Des Moines Iowa about a year ago some kid dropped a rock from an 
overpass and hit car just behind the windshield  It put a dent in the roof 
so I guess I was lucky it hit metal

It's frustrating that we can't do much  Bother the city government to put
covers on all overpasses  Slow downspeed up a bit when driving under all
overpasses in the city  I like the first better but that will take time
and lots of people talking to the city governments

Just another

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface
isn't much different to a typical TX freeway They are better
in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

They light the highways in Texas  Funny everywhere else I've been
they only light 'em at junctions

I won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and
localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
essentially nonexistant

than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at  will kill you at  Don't get me wrong I love to

It would have to be quite severe I don't recall any US freeway
without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe
at  in any decent well damped car

I suspect you have very limited experience  US freeways vary
dramatically particularly between states  I can name a number of
interstate highways in various parts of the country where  would be
very optimistic in any car

I'm not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations
but I suspect every single bridge junction on I through CT would be
considered so  They're hard to take at mph  That's not the only
interstate I've seen with such deviations but it's one I drive
frequently

Texas is pretty much an edgecase  you can't assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such
wideopen spaces  It just ain't so

Wharf Wrat rites

They were designed for speeds of upwards of   I forget the
exact spec  but for military vehicles  That's  in a  Dodge 
Powerwagon  Not  in a  Ford Taurus

Ever' once in a while you still see a reference to the super
slab system as Interstate and Defense Highways  But whether
the military has much of anything that goes  on the road is
another matter  A few of their most whompedup diesel trucks
maybe load permitting  The military surplus stuff I've
driven  Jeep Classic WillysKaiserAMC preindependent
suspension and Power Wagons Slant  in a crewcab pickup
weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds and I wouldn't
swear any of them would do  except as a bedload on a semi

You just gotta love the standard military tire too or at
least the one they used to use  Designed circa WW II as a
compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity
on sharp rocks and so forth it's quite illadapted to high
speeds on civilian roadways  For those who can't remember
what they look like imagine a mountainbike tire with a
road rib in the middle scaled up to car size Oh yeah and
narrow too One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus 
Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of
the advancements made in ride and handling since DDay

But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands  if
you're going to do  in a milspec ' Power Wagon or a
Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubbertired
vehicle anywhere I'd suggest the American interstate  
Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car
and skills road maintenance and the swarms of fools around
you the roads were designed for going like the devil

Naturally neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe or
unlawful driving

Anybody got any goodbad experience with selling their car through one of
those car hunters  I'm selling a  Dodge Stealth RT and I was contacted
by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois  

They said they have  buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't
be talking to me  They talked to me for a good  minutes asking everything
about my car and said they could sell it no problem  They guaranteed that if
they didn't sell my car in  days I would get my money back  and since
I charged it I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied
I would get a refund which is true  They federal expressed all the paperwork 
to me which had a contract stating their policy about the  days and such

I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is
good news  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far it's been
over week and I have gotten nothing  So how effective are these types of 
companies Anybody care to share their experiences

that get taken into account when I purchase my new car  Does the
dealership pay off my car and add on the amount they had to pay to

If you don't already know it you should call the bankcredit union
finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the
current payoff cost

If you are trading in your current car on the new car subtract the
payoff amount from the tradein the dealer is giving you  If this
turns out to be a negative number you need to reconsider the deal
Subtract this difference from the price of the new car  This is the
size of the loan you will need for the new car

The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out
of the money you give them when you pick up your new car

At least that's how it worked for me  years ago in Ohio

Dear Netters

I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon ' or ' TSi AWD

I would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was
maintained  I own a turbocharged one and I would never buy a
turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and hisher
drivingmaintenance habits

Question is that the ' TSi AWD was mentioned in the
April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid

I have been wondering about that myself  The ' AWD models and the
's were identical except for the ABS option  

In particular the manual transmission

Yes  Some owners had problems with the transaxles  Using
synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most
cases  The problem was not unique to the AWDs however  It was
common to all models  The Galant VR and GSX had the same transaxle
but I didn't see those listed in CR

electrical system

I don't know of any major complaints in this area except that the
battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating 

and brakes were below par in both models

The first FWD models those built before May  were recalled for
brake upgrades  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped
rotors  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every
time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem

A friend of mine
ownes a ' TSi AWD and he has had  brake jobs pads

I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one
day  It all depends on how you drive  It seems that most owners have
been getting between k on a set of pads

one stuck valve

First time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars
other than timing belt failures

and some clutchtransmission problem something
about stickinggrinding into second gear  This doesn't seem
too bad if one beats on his car

If your friend beats on the car then his unit is not a
representative sample of the car's reliability

My suggestion is instead of listening to the useless Consumer Reports
talk to several owners the mailing list may be the best way to reach
a few of them

I am willing to suffer reliabilityfor speed and looks  Seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three  Anyway can
anyone please let me know how you like your Talon and any
problems you may have had and if the repairs are worth it

if humorimpaired skipto TheEnd
No matter how much you pay you won't get all three  Examples

NSX       reliability and looks
Ferrari   reliability HHHHHH yeah right speed and looks

TheEnd

Hello netters

I'm visiting the US I'm from Sweden in August I will probably rent a Chevy
Beretta from Alamo I've been quoted  for a week  for additional days
This would include free driving distance but not local taxes Baltimore 
They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but I doubt that
 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than what's included in the base price But on the other hand he 
didn't rent it from Alamo

Does anyone have some info on this

Is  a ripoff 
No that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city

Probability that I'll be needing more insurance
Unless you have an accident you won't need more  If you plan on
paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card
automatically covers rental cars  Also your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also

Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and
require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it  The
credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell

I have never rented from Alamo so I don't know if they follow this
same practice

Is the beretta a good rental car
Yes  It is a compact door probably a bit dull performance and
accelerationwise but very adequate  It will have an automatic
transmission AMFM stereo air conditioning and possibly power 
windows and door locks

race car stuff deleted

Back to the F stuff for a second note that the auto' tranny in F
STILL shifts at the driver's command not some preselected schedule  The
driver still controls the shifting not the transmission 

 now there is no dispute that in production cars automatics are
 inherently more lossy than manuals  that is in theory  my point all
 along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an
 automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isn't skillful or

One thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact that
it has a torque converter vs a clutch  I know this sounds strange but
a torque converter multiplies the engine output when launching  It functions
           
as a sort of limited Continuously Variable Transmission Typically you get 
a torque multiplication of  to  times depending on the stall speed

I have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile 
Such systems do exist but none are presently installed in production autos
that I am aware of  These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or
fluidic amplifiers 

Contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no TQ mult

What the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to its
torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's
driveline  Chevy proved it many years ago with the ' Camaro ETs and
terminal  mile times were close enough tpo be identical for  speed and
auto cars  Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can
get away with fewer gears than a manual the slip in the convertor makes up
for the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed
 sspeed autos soon to be out note that some manufacturers are using 
speed manulas now 

Once past lauch however the converter begins coupling and the TQ multiplication
effect is reduced but by then you should be on the cam

My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over  
The outcome was decidedly mixed  I won the battle but 
lost the war  The arbitrator found that the car was 
defective but decided to offer a repurchase well below 
market value   At the time of the hearing average 
retail on my truck in the NADA book was  but 
the decision was for    I wrote a letter to the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the 
fact that if you have an automobile that does not 
depreciate rapidly the manufacturer has no incentive 
to deal with you  There is no way that the 
manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and 
sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded 
a repurchase  The attitude of Chevrolet's 
representative at the hearing tends to support this 
point of view  he was totally unprepared and did not 
seem to take the proceeding very seriously

I decided to take the repurchase even though I am 
getting totally screwed on the price  I will not have 
to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon 
myself and I have no case for a civil suit based on 
the Idaho lemon law  I am planning to send a letter to 
my elected representatives telling them how utterly 
ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is  The law allows for 
a use deduction equal to the IRS mileage allowance  
As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying 
for my insurance

Summary of the case  In May  I bought a new  ton
HD Chevrolet pickup  Between May  and December  
this vehicle required repair after repair  Systems 
that required attention included the transmission 
heater fan paint suspension and motor  The main 
problem was the five speed manual transmission  They 
could not install a nondefective transmission in at 
least four attempts

So in summary it is possible to get a repurchase but 
you are going to get screwed on the price unless you 
paid too much in the first place or if your car 
happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly

Could we plase cease this discussion  I fail to see why people feel the need 
to expound upon this issue for days and days on end  These areas are not
 meant for this type of discussion  If you feel the need to do such things
 please take your thought elsewhere  Thanks
 
I just want to second this request I value this net group as one where people
focus on solving problems and go out of their way to be respectful of
differences The hostility expressed in the original posting feels like an
assault 
 
Thanks
Jan 
 

   Exactly my point  There is a lot of hostility to and from teenagers

   Look I sent these posts here to altparentsteens with a copy to
 recautos since you people in this group may have the best advice for
 and experience with troubled teenagers

   If you follow the news for the northwest USA you will have heard that a
 group of year old boys barely out of the teens certainly their outlook
 was developed during their teens just shot and killed an innocent little
 girl riding in a car in the Seattle area when her mother who was driving
 honked her horn at the car with the boys in it  This is really upsetting
 and makes my stomach turn as it would any parent's   Doesn't your heart
 just go out to that poor mother


Yes Fred my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have 
been victims of these and other senseless crimes

   You folks in this group have a responsibility to offer any good advice
 that you may have  I suspect lots of people all over the world will read
 and appreciate your comments


However I feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings see 
top  Your statement of 'responsibility' is felt as an attack towards the 
members of this group  You are attempting to make the members of this group
be REQUIRED to answer  The only people who should make a statement are people
who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution

   Teenagers both drive cars and are involved in automotive vandalism and
 crime  Maybe someone on this newsgroup has had specific experience in
 dealing with violent teenage offenders like these kids are  At the same
 time maybe you would have some good advice for those hostile people who
 sense that are now the potential victims  Maybe you would have some good
 advice for them on how not to pay back andor not make the situation worse  
 Maybe you have some good advice for local authorities or schools where
 this problem is prevalent  But then again maybe you're not interested 

Many people are interested but have no input  I will restate that your last
sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group  If people have
input they will give it  If they do not YOU should not make them feel 
compelled sp to respond  

If you wish to continue this conversation PLEASE send email  DO NOT repost or
attempt to bait me I will not make another post and may I make the same a
suggestion to other group members on this matter



   Thanks in advance for your help if we get any


BTW your welcome

  my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car
 
jpvllyoakresuncom Jeff Perry writes

 FYI just last week the PBS show Motor Week gave the results of what they 
 thought were the best cars for '  In the convertible category the 
 Honda Civic del Sol achieved this honor  
  
 The one downside I see with the car is its interior it looks 
 inexpensive and dull
 
I own a del Sol and I must vouch for the interior  I really looks snazzy when
the top is off  I looks a lot better in person than on the television  I saw
that Motorweek as well  Needless to say I was smiling a bit by the time it
was over   

Watch out for that darned convertible tan tho

I am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a VW
Passat GLX  How does it compare to a Toyota Camry  I thought the car
looked very solid stable and European  Only disappointment so far is
that that it doesn't offer an airbao my next question is why isn't VW
offering automobiles with airbags  Should I pay the extra three
thousand for a BMW  is even though it is smaller and less powerful
than than the Passat

I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing  It's only been in the last
year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature
VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt requirements for
passive restraint but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would
actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag

VW is really hurting right now in the US market  Check out the
article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW  Golfs and
Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico but they don't have
the quality at that facility  As per normal VW practice the US
launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again until a good chunk
of the useful life of the design is spent

I think that Passats come from Germany so there is not the same
quality and availability issue  It's a nice car with a nice engine
Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a
different question

I'll leave the Passat  Camry flamewar for someone else

I have a  chevy sprint with ac and doors It's odometer turned k
and the sensor light started blinking I went to the dealer and he said
it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor He
said It is to be changed every k but since I bought the car when it
had k I don't know if the same thing happened at k and k  He
quoted  for the part and  to install it The part cost 
outside but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor
is placed too deep in the engine parts He suggested I wait till it
malfunctions before I do anything  If anyone out there owns a chevy
sprint I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed Also
did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help Also
what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction 
  Any help would be greatly apprecisted
   Thanks




I sold my ' Sprint last April with k on it  I'd driven it since
the previous July putting k miles on it  The sensor light used to
light up regularly starting about k miles after I bought it  
My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment
so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement  Performance hah
if you could call it that did not change  Perhaps emissions increased
but how much emissions could a CAregistered  cylinder engine produce
That was a neat car I held the engine block easily in one hand  Has
anyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant  Just curious

For an all out sports car I'd go for the RX without the sports
suspension which is too stiff  For a little more practicality and more
comfort the Nissan ZX Turbo is a good buy  And for a good dose of
luxury the Lexus SC is perfect with a manual transmission of course
However the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks
the performance is supposed to be great almost race car like  I don't
particulary like the Mitsubishi GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are
too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car

Is it only me or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car

It depends on your priorities  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety buying unsafe econoboxes
instead of Volvos  I personally take a middle ground  the only
thing I really look for is a threepoint seatbelt and mph bumpers
I figure that mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are
lots of lowspeed collisions that do worry me

anything if he hadn't emptied his gun into the asshole  Texasit's

That reminds me of one of Texas's adsyou hear a guy speaking in
French like it's a letter home then the French moves to the 
background and a Frenchaccented voice come to the foreground talking
about how he went walking on the beach and it felt so much like
home that he decided to take his shoes offand the rest of his
clothes It ended with please send bail 

On an recautos note does anyone carry a gun on them or keep one in
their car which is bad idea isn't it if you work in a bad part of
town or regularly go through one  Is this a loaded question  

I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded
magazine handy which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma For those
times that I'm travelling interstate I keep an unloaded 
SW  Magnum revolver in the glove box with a speedloader
in my pocket which is legal everywhere under Federal law Illinois

As I've said before this is stricly for defense my insurance
will pay to replace my car but I only have one life

around in a door car  My criteria are door ac amfm cassette
quick acceleration cruise control decent rear seat legroom my
husband is a footer  It must also be under k
preferably closer to the k range which will probably rule out
the Accord  The ' cars that have caught my eye are Toyota Corolla 
Toyata Camry Mazda  Pontiac Grand Am Pontiac Grand Prix 
Honda Accord and Civic if it's roomy enough and still comes in a 
door model Hyundai Sonata and maybe even a small Oldsmobile 
although not the Achieva  All opinions benchmarks
recommendations etc are welcome

I really wouldn't consider the Grand AmAcheviaSkylark all the same
since they are very bad in frontal collsions and don't have any
other really outstanding qualities

john
 

I really must object to that last statement  Having a lot of experience
with a ' Grand Am coupe I can firmly state that they do have a lot of
outstanding qualities  Very reliable throughout  Great layout of controls
and components  Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car  They 
look sharp inside and out  The V that I drive has exceptional power and 
drivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven

All in all it's a funtodrive dependable and reasonably priced vehicle
Please don't knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with
specific reasons why you feel that way

 Is that one mag or two B and I was wondering if people out
 there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to say

Depending on how you plan to use your SUV I might recommend also
browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup Shotgun
and WD magazines  The car rags mostly seem to consider recently
graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips
to be a bedload  Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be 
used mostly as robust station wagons that's probably not a bad
approach but if your applications are more demanding pick your
information sources accordingly

Of the three vehicles on your short list Explorer Runner 
Pathfinder I'd recommend the Runner as being closely based 
on a rather robust pickup and the Explorer for being comfortably 
carlike  Don't know much about the Pathfinder

Good luck

Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me I'd guess that this is on the same
chassis as the Kadett rather than the bigger Manta  but I could easily
be wrong  I think the later Kadett's were sold here as Buick Opels

G'day people
	
	Are there any MR owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why
my MR's engine sounds noisy The MR's engine is noisy at the best of times 
but not even a nice nose  it's one of those very ugly noises 
	I do an oil change every  months and for about  months the engine
noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling At around the  month
mark after an oil change I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months
now it starts to get that very disgusting noise not so much during driving
but more so during idling 
	What's its problem 
	Also I don't know if it's just me but if noticed a little
performance drop It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to 

	Any helptips would be appreciated

Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me I'd guess that this is on the same
chassis as the Kadett rather than the bigger Manta  but I could easily
be wrong  I think the later Kadett's were sold here as Buick Opels

Craig

	I think the Manta is the European name for the GT  I'm pretty sure
that the only Kadett's sold here wereare the Pontiac LeMans  I think the
GT is just an early 's to mid 's Manta

Sounds more like an Opel GT  Neat cars fun to drive  Sold through
Buick from  through  if I remember correctly  I believe it
was in ' that there were some engine mods made such that parts
were not interchangeable with the older models  Parts are thus much
harder to come by for the later models  Parts in general are not
too difficult to find  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff
including a brand new not remfg long block  Either a GT or a
Kharman Ghia hmm that spelling looks hosed will be my next project

As I recall from reading posts here a while back Rovax Rovacs died
because it was larger and noisier than the competing cheap R systems
of it day  Probably a case of bad timing  I think the system would
have a better chance today now that R systems are on death row but
investors may be hard to come by a second time

Gee you really make me confused  What is radiator  Where is it located
What does it look like  Will it release any radiation since it sounds 
like radiation generator when you punch holes


Of course it releases radiation Thats why your car goes faster when
you punch the holes in it All that radiation gets on your engine
and gives it pep scientific term You get more horsepower 
torque too If you don't know what HP  torque are you can read
mile long threads on the subject but they are all wrong Horsepower
is how much power a horse can make pulling a Subaru and torque is

developed nations

I am an American but I was raised in Europe where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into or have his pocket
picked by Slaves or Russian refugees

Of cource there will be some nutcases but thats extremely rare

Ie in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying

In Germany  you can walk the sidewalks at  am and not even look 
behind your back at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen

Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying

I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere

Of course these postings sould be in soccultureUS but if we reduce

more money on modifing our cars Now my posting is recautostech

The Continental may have been the first modern era auto to mount the
spare on the rear of the car but it was hardly the first car to sport one
Various mounting techniques for rear mounting the spare were quite common
in early automobiles both US and Foreign

Right In the thirties both Buick and Packard had two spares mounted in
wells in the front fenders Of course that was back when the front
fenders were long enough to provide room There were a couple of other
marques that did this as well but memory fades

As a long time motorcyclist I have never understood what
posessed auto builders to put delicate controls which must
be used with skill and finesse like clutches and brakes
on the floor

Why not hand control It's much much easier

In the early days neither of these functions had powerassist so
only legs had enough strength to activate them  Since then it's
been traditional and people would have a hard time getting
used to anything else  

Well where exactly would you put a hand clutch and brake On
a motorcycle it's easy the handlebars have a very limited
range of turning Steering wheels on the other hand turn around
and around and aroundwhich is fine for electrical relays like
your cruise control and airbagbut how many of you want to
lose your clutch andor brake due to a short circuit

Shades of the Edsel They had pushbuttons in the steering wheel hub
that controlled the auto tranny It was very disconcerting to shift
into reverse when turning a corner and the wires shorted

There are workarounds but there's really no reason to use hand
power on a car's clutch or brakes and lightening them to the
point that they are finesse controls suitable for hand use
would increse the mechanical complexity substantially look at
power brakes and nonpower brakes for an example

I saw an experimental car that had a joystick instead of a steering
wheel

That's about useless IMHO 

Another automotive oddity is separate keys for trunks doors and
ignitions Why on earth would you want this

I know I don't

I want a separate trunk key for security reasons it gives me a totally
separate lockable container For door and ignitionehhh the same key's
OK I guess

I think this is getting a little overheated  Highway robbers have been a
part of life since the Middle Ages at least  It's human nature to look
at history through rose colored glasses but random acts of violence have
been a ceaseless part of our heritage  Overall life is better now than it
ever was then  It's just that random individual acts of violence have
never
been historically significant and record keeping in the past was never
good
enough to retain them all

I have a  chevy sprint with ac and doors It's odometer turned k
and the sensor light started blinking I went to the dealer and he said
it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor He
said It is to be changed every k but since I bought the car when it
had k I don't know if the same thing happened at k and k  He
quoted  for the part and  to install it The part cost 
outside but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor
is placed too deep in the engine parts He suggested I wait till it
malfunctions before I do anything  If anyone out there owns a chevy
sprint I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed Also
did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help Also
what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction 
  Any help would be greatly apprecisted
   Thanks

      Nagesh
I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every
K to let you know it's time for a check up  When that light goes on I just
take it to the delaer tell them It's that time and they work on it for  hou
and you pay  for parts and  for labor Ahhwhat they get for labor
I currently have about K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for
service I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the
Oxygen sensor  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor  As far an I know of I have
never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten
Now I don't have ac Mother Nature does that for me   and that might have
something to do with it but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor  The only
MAJOR service job I have had on my car besides getting the tires replaced
if you want to call that a service job was getting the Rotor Distributor and
Gasket replaced  And that was all done within the past  months  

What I do at K is have a good tuneup let them replace what ever they need
to pay the bill about  and go home and don't worry about the car for
another K  Oh I just remembered something  If that little sensor light
bothers you in the fuse box right below the turnsignal lever up against
the dash there is a swith on the right side  Flip that switch and the light
will go off  I do that so that little light won't annoy me  If you can't
find it look it up in the car manuel  I hope that I have helped a little
and good luck with the Oxygen sensor

  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these
electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage  What kind of
memory is stablereliable enough nonvolatile enough and independent enough
of outside battery power to last say  years or more in the life of a
vehicle  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for
this length of time especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that
are doing good to work for  months without breaking down somehow

MKT from thomsom  It has a timekeeper clock and  bytes of NVRAM which
has a lithium battery backup  The battery has a life of  years of poweroff
operation  Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not
draw much current  The battery would only be used when your auto battery was
dead or had been removed

Side question  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with
a replaced odometer that starts over at  miles after say K
actual miles  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy  for the price of a
new odometer you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the
buyer it has

In California they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states
that the odometer mileage is correct  If incorrect you are required to 
fill in what you know or guesstimate to be the correct mileage  If you
lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can
sue you for the value of the mileage differential

Les Bartel's comments
Sorry I can't help you with your question but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket AC units  I have a FrostKing or FrostTemp
forget which aftermarket unit on my Cavalier and am quite unhappy with
it  The fan is noisy and doesn't put out much air  I will never have
an aftermarket AC installed in any of my vehicles again  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience
  les

Let me add my  in I had a AC installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the AC that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine I have talked to other people that have had the same
result Don't know if this is just a probable with Ford or what

	Ernie Smith

i agree never have the dealer add anything to your car  if you want ac
make sure it is factory installedhonda's maybe excluded many can't be 
bought with ac installed at the factory but i think maybe they actually
use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one inas
in bigger radiator etcor are designed properly for this in the st place
anyway my point is the dealer installed ac won't be anywhere near as good
as factory and the service bums will mess up your car when installing it
scratches screwdriver holes in seatsparts not reinstalled correctly or 
with all the screws etc  i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm
dealer for  yearshe said never have a dealer add anything to your car
except maybe floormats

Thanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question
It does seem that the master cylinder is bad I will have my
mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler
and cheaper first but from your responses it sounds like it
is very likely to be the master cylinder

Thanks everyone

The Taurus SHO for those who can get it straight it is SHO as in Super

Having spoken to technical staff from Ford many times I can assure you that 
internally at Ford this car is always called the Taurus Show or just  
the Show  As in long o sound  I still refer to it as the SHO
however because it sounds better to me I assume many purist fans and owners 
prefer using the Ford lingo

A replica would be great I think  

							TKH '

The VW Thing Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and 
possibly South America  Good luck importing one  They probably don't meet 
US safety and pollution requirements  There are mechanics and junkyards 
which specialize in VW they might be helpful for finding a Thing unless 
the WWII reenacters have grabbed them all

The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep but was not 
wheel drive  One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox Kentucky 
also the rare Schwimwagen sp amphibious version in fullscale dioramas
Highly recommended

It is actually simple in principle Porous adsorbents like zeolite and
activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate water
or methanol etc giving the cooling effect  Upon being heated the 
gassaturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be
condensed  This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle  The only problem
is that the COP is very low

I just started reading this thread today so forgive me if it has already been
mentioned  Butwhat was the deal with Renault's putting the horn on the
lefthand turnsignal stalk  It was a button on the end where the washer
button would be on the wiperwasher stalk  Could the Frenchies not figure
out the wiring through the steering wheel or what

Had an ' Alliance for a long time  It was a comfortable but sluggish
car  I got very used to the horn on the stalk after a couple months worth
of getting used to it  After I bought my next car a Chevy it took me
forEVER to get used to the horn on the steering wheel again

I think he's talking about a different form of rush Evidently it's fun to be
terrified But hey if you want that kind of rush try bobsledding You may
only get up to  or so but it makes  in a car feel like a stroll in the
park

Why should a good driver be terrified at mph The only thing I fear
going at  are drivers who switch to the left lane without using
either rearviewmirror or flashers Doing  to  ain't a rush
for me but it's fun and I get where I want to go much faster

But in one point You are quite right If You are terrified at  You
should better not drive that fast or You'll be a hazard to others

BTW before You flame me read my EMail address I know what I'm 
talking about as I live in Germany

 BK

Chris    crhregentetechniktumuenchende

not a flame just a point  I'd be scared at  here not because i feel
I  or my car couldn't handle it but because of exactly what you said
drivers who are STUPID  Like the ones who are doing  also and so
they pull in right behind you at maybe  car lengthsoh yeah real
smart  This scares me in cities at   When i can't see enough of
the car to make it recognizable they are following TOO CLOSE  And 
when i see them doing this AND reading a newspapersighthis
is why America has  speed limits our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise
that reading the paper should be done at breakfast or work not in their
car

   relates an experience similar to mine 
 Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped  As we go out
 the front door the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom
 customers and all Go ahead  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan
 So my friend bought a Sentra
 

This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience' For  
crying out loud how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers  
this way and still stay in business Again I don't expect sales people to  
bow scrape and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be  
abused either I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to  
me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales  
cubicles Evidently their success rate is high enough that they continue  
to do business this way There must be a lot of people out there who are  
easy to intimidate

On the other hand I'm not sure about the 'one price no haggling'  
approach that Saturn and other are starting to use I guess if their fixed  
price is fair it's OK Maybe the best approach is to do your homework  
before you go in Find out the invoice prices of the car add a reasonable  
profit for the dealer  offer them that price and stick to  
it If they get abusive just leave Then don't let them try to screw you  
after the deal is agreed on

Well I guess I know for sure what I meant and it is this  I don't know where
you drive but around here freeways are often clogged solid with large packs
of semis trucks and cars of all descriptions  When I close on one of these
rolling clusterfs on the highway I have no desire to add my vehicle to this
rolling accident looking for a place to happen If there were any way to pass it
I WOULD BE PASSING MYSELF however I can't      As I posted before all it
takes is a blown tire or some moron tramping on the brakes to turn this pack 
into a cloud of shredded metal flying glass and burning vehicles   I want to
maintain enough free space between myself and this mess to at least have a
minimal chance to avoid a mass crash That means maintaining a clear space 
between me and it
However there is no end of shortdriving morons who are dying to pass so they
can add themselves and their car to the bodycount  That wouldn't bother me so
much except that after letting enough of these morons pass me and glue themselves
to the pack ahead my interval is filled up Trying to back off further does not 
work because the road behind me has filled up trapping my car right into an ever
increasing pack  Now if there was any slight possibility that there was a lane
open ahead I'd be glad to move over But there usually is no way in hell that
anybody is going anywhere So I block the wouldbe passers Not only for my own
good  but theirs as well even though they are often too stupid to realize it


Just an comment  I don't like it when people decide what's good for me
If you think you're going to decide anything for me you'd better be 
carrying a badge and a gun  Who made you capable of determining if there
is no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere  Why do you find 
it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own 
business  If someone is minding their own business I will give them
all the room they want and I'll try to make things easy for them even
letting them in in front of me if they ask politely with a directional
On the other hand if someone like you decides they want to block me and
be a general asshole you can bet your ass that I'll make life as 
miserable as possible for you as long as it doesn't affect anyone else
who's minding their own business  
They have a phrase to describe someone like you
Self Appointed Traffic Police
Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong

As a rule of philosophy I don't feel particularly sorry when somebody gets 
offed by his own stupidity but It does worry me when some idiot is in a position
to cash in my chips too

I don't know about where you are but here in California false
representation
of odometer readings is a criminal felony If you can substantiate this
you need to report that dealer to the local authorities You should consult
with a lawyer to tell you what civil action you can take as well Keep in
mind that you will have to prove that the dealer was aware of the change in
the dashboard

	I think the Manta is the European name for the GT  I'm pretty sure
that the only Kadett's sold here wereare the Pontiac LeMans  I think the
GT is just an early 's to mid 's Manta

The manta was a twodoor sedan in the US
It had a  engine
Was sometimes referred to as an Opel 
Manta's are also ve hot and fun cars too

I am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust
for my  BMW i So far I have found a Pacesetter exhaust for 
and an Ansa exhaust for  Canadian funds I was wondering if anyone
could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible
exhausts that I may be interested in My main priorities are a decent horse
power increase  and a nice low note to go along with that added power
I was also thinking of looking into both Remus and Leistritz exhaustsHas 
anyone got anything to say about these I am mainly looking for the muffler
only but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit I would be willing to
go after that I also would like to know how much these would cost me in the 
StatesPlease mail me back if you have any information

I just had my  Chrysler painted I was told to refrain from waxing it and
to leave it out in the sun Supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from
the paint over a month or so I can smell it  feet away on a hot day and
lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out as the paint remains
a little soft for a while

My boss is interested in a new  series Mercedes Benz wagon
Does anyone have any testimonial evidence andor strong opinions
on this car or line

Particularly I would like to hear about power manual t only
reliability feel and any unusually good or bad features of the
line

She currently drives a VW Passat and is being plagued by its
electrical problems  The dealer claims there is nothing wrong
even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them
selves while you are driving down the road  The automatic shoulder
restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along
She does not have the new larger engine and is quite
dissatisfied with its lack of power

The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems
such as the Passat's electrical system  She is also considering
a Saab  add some letters  Any comparisons between the 
line and the Mercedes would be helpful

Price is not an impediment

  Neither car was designed to turn at those speeds
  Neither car was designed to stop quickly from those speeds
  Safety mechanisms were not designed for impacts at those speeds
  An uncontrolled environment leads to unpredictable circumstances
    where you might need to turn or stop with no notice


Do you by any chance own an SHO or have access to one such that you

	Are there any MR owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why
my MR's engine sounds noisy The MR's engine is noisy at the best of times 
but not even a nice nose  it's one of those very ugly noises 

assuming yours is a non turbo MR the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline  that doesn't have balance shafts  i guess toyota
didn't care about little details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling

myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or
recommendation which has an inline  larger than  liters and no
balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine  

if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V

As long as we're on the subject Several years ago myself and two others

overpass quickly to see who did it We figured it was kids reported it and
left
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company He was
in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away They caught the  year old
that did it They put a cover over the overpass what else could they do

Execute the juvi on the grounds of the reformatory required attendendence

I'm considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
guns by police depts I'm not sure where


Geico has purchased radar guns in several states I know they have done
it here in CT

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had  accident and were immediately dropped  And once
you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk and end up forking out  or  times what you should be for insurance

My suggestion stay where you are or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico

I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to clean up
diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter  I'd assume easier
since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses  Let's hear people's opinions

 Watch out for that darned convertible tan tho
 
 
 i simply must inquire how can people honestly consider this car
 a convertible  Does Porsche have a patent on the targa name
 I mean convertible to me means top down which the del Sol certainly
 does NOT do  It has the center that lifts out  This is what i would
 term a targaunless Porsches was gonna sue me for doing that  I know
 the rear window rolls down but i still can hardly consider this car
 to be a convertible
 

Yes however with the top off and the rear window down this car is more 
like a convertible than a coupe  Think of it as a convertible with an 
integrated rollbar like addition

Bricklins were manufactured in the s with engines from Ford They are rather

Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies There is
little or no chance that they are the same The Manta went through several
generations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time

that the only Kadett's sold here wereare the Pontiac LeMans  I think the

Not true The Kadett has been in and out of the US market over the years
The LeMans old Kadett is only the latest version

so let's get some responses on the net

The question again
Does anyone have any info on the  Eagle Talon  Mitsubishi

I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant
and that in Japan a  hp twinturbo V  Galant has been

So anyway any info on the ' Talon would be appreciated

I'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it  Since I paid
cash for the last car I bought I did not have to worry about
whether or not I had a good amount of insurance on it because
of a bank loan  I just put the amount that I wanted not what
a bank would have wanted  Friends are telling me that banks
require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it
is collateral on loans  Is this true  Can that insurance be
gotten as part of my other insurance  I assume I don't have to
pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance
Am I correct  I hear about accidenthealth type insurance at
the dealers and I am pretty sure these are just money makers
for them  I just want to verify that I don't have to buy
these at all  Or any other types of extras

What do I have to pay for  Car tax license  Anything else

the Chrysler minivans not only is this not true at all but it was a stupid
claim to make the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the 
vans  Kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet eh


And I thought Buick and Oldsmobile where bad  Shame on you Nissan and 
Mercury
 
 Any other interpretations

 I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
 Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX
 
 But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  I'd assume easier
 since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  Let's hear people's opinions

This really bugs me  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle
but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars
in California  What a bunch of crap  Diesel is the fuel of choice for 
enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason

The particulates are nothing but carbon  They are just an annoyance at worst
Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions torque or engine
durability  It's also cheaper

In a previous article wratunisqlUUCP wharfie says

	That shows how much you know about anything  The brakes on the
SHO are very different   inch or  I forget discs all around
vented in front  The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front 
drums rear

one i saw had vented rears tooit was on a lot
of course the sales man was a fooltitanium wheelsyeah right
then later told me they were magnesiummore believable but still
crap since Al is so m uch cheaper and just as good

i tend to agree tho that this still doesn't take the SHO up to standard
for running  on a regular basis  The brakes should be bigger like
 or sotake a look at the  ones on the Corradoswhere they have
braking regulations

Well let's seemy TBird SC has a computercontrolled adjustable
suspension wheel ABS disks  vented front   rear point
							
						Rears also vented

belts sturdy passenger compartment aerodynamics good enough for 
NASCAR without too much change  hp ftlb supercharged l V
wheel independent suspension plus limitedslip differential with 
a top speed in excess of mph and rides on Vrated tires I have yet
to find Rs in any other speed rating 

Is that up to standard If not why not

james i really hate to do this but try reading the damn posts

Then you shouldn't've done it Try answering the damn question
I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC
in there

never was a t'bird mentioned  The discussion was about SHO's and
'stangs not being up to spec  I do not know about t'birds  I
only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded
a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff  This does not
kn any way  disencourage me from wishing to own one nor does it make it
a bad car  It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra
bit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes as the wheels are plenty large
enough for them to fit if memory serves right which it may very well not
and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it

Well my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar
characteristics front and rear disks ABS on the SHO high output
V wheel independent suspension very good aerodynamics point
harness fat rubber and mph top speed If one of them is 
up to standard and I think the SC is but the other isn't then
why is that No flamage just curiousity

 But waiiiiiit isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as
 government paperwork goes Nissan Stanza Altima to avoid costly and
 lengthy paperwork I read this on the net a while ago and someone
 actually may have said there's a little Stanza logo on the Altima
 somewhere

I just bought an Altima and like it very much and yes there is a
little Stanza logo ever so discretely placed on the trunk The Altima is
emblazoned in big silver letters but the itsybitsy Stanza is shunted
to the far left of the trunk lid You can only see it if you get up
close to the car and know where to look It is very inconspicuous

In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual
called the car a Nissan Stanza Altima

Anybody know why Nissan did it this way

Eliot is right about  liter engine in the second and last generation
MR's But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR If it's a
first generation car like my ' it has  liter engine or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger if it's ' '
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard
I don't know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply
makes noise Not all that annoying mind you But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear 
MikeS

Sorry 'bout that  Mine is a ' model nonturbo  with ABS and revised
suspension whatever revised means I'm in Australia so we always seem to 
get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as 
standard

My query is  why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about  months after
an oil change I just find it a bit wierd that this happens Is it the oil I'm
using Mobil  or is it the engine the SGE versionmodel ie gets
noiser the older the oil is I'm only guessing 

Its not annoyingly distressing or anything but just slightly puzzling

well actually he didn't but we'll pretend the real author of this
query has his name tacked in here


  my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car

I was about to recommend you consider a targa top over a convertible but 
DREW made the point very well  When my wife and I were in our s we
did the convertible thing with Triumphs  Now in our mids we still
appreciate the open air but prefer targa types  There is much less wind
noise objectspapers blowing around foreign objects getting into the
car and one still has almost all the advantages of the convertible  

Tom

while it's being mentioned i personally prefer the moonroofsunroofttop
targa thing as well  I simply don't like cloth tops nor the extra insurance
nor the S color matching alot of companies do  If i chose a convertible
it'd be

a Mazda RX II  I just like the way they look  It'd have to be in black
with color matched black topthey look good

b VW cabriolet  They do a suberb job of matching colors too  Also last year
for them  COLLECTOR'S ITEM

c mustang GT droptopthey look ok too

i know this doesn't help but i thought i'd do it anyway

good luck to your wifeand you

 As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while 
 here in Europe they are rare Just wondering

In many of our cities there are traffic signals every  feet unsynchronised
of course well here in Ottawa anyway and the roads are so congested that 
shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot  Also most Canadians are
too stupid to learn how to shift manually gee I gotta coordinate my two
feet on the clutch brake and accelerator and I gotta steer shift and
operate the signals optional and radio with my two hands duh it 

i agree wholeheartedly

can't be done  Also most North American made cars come with the automatic 
as standard equipment so why bother with a manual when the car can shift 
for you for no addition money

not sure about there in CA but here in US the manuals are quite often the
standard equipment  Of course FINDING a car with one might be hard but
if you read the sticker on the window there is usally an additional k or
so tacked on for that lousy  tranny  So you actually ARE paying more just
that it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped standard  this
applies to MOST cars but not to the luxoyachtseg caddilac licolns etc

Sounds more like an Opel GT  Neat cars fun to drive  Sold through
Buick from  through  if I remember correctly  I believe it
was in ' that there were some engine mods made such that parts
were not interchangeable with the older models  Parts are thus much
harder to come by for the later models  Parts in general are not
too difficult to find  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff
including a brand new not remfg long block  Either a GT or a
Kharman Ghia hmm that spelling looks hosed will be my next project

Mark


In  they lowered the engine compression so that it would run on
regular gas not to mention the addition of emission controls  The ' 
also added popout rear quarter windows

Alot of parts are available for the GT from C  R Small Cars in CT and
used from Bill Daley's Opel Parts in MA

Here is a press release from the US Department of Energy

 Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel
Vehicles
 To National Desk Environment and Energy Reporters
 Contact Larry Hart of the US Department of Energy 

   WASHINGTON April    Secretary of Energy
Hazel R O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on
Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a driving force
behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative
fuel vehicles and fuel supplies
   President Clinton signed the order today which calls for
federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the
next three years at least  percent higher than those called for
in the Energy Policy Act of 
   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner
Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to
advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order
   I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make
this happen O'Leary said  As Land Commissioner Gary Mauro has
helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet
to alternative fuels and has been a tireless proponent of natural
gas vehicles in speeches across the country
   The task force is to issue a report within  days recommending
a plan and schedule of implementation
   The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead
by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a
practical affordable choice for fleet owners across the country
O'Leary said  Increased use of domesticallyproduced alternative
fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs  We believe
that energy efficiency protecting the environment and a healthy
economy are complimentary goals
   O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to
coordinate the agencies' fiveyear purchase plans help with
funding for extra purchase or conversion costs and work with GSA
to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make
fleet conversions practical
   Under the order the Department of Energy will also be working
with states local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle
purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make
alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely
available

I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata  I
know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that
have them swear by them  They also haven't had the problems with
them that Consumer Reports claims  I haven't driven one yet  I
have driven a ' Hyundai Elantra which Consumer Reports also
trashed and was very impressed with it  The local Hyundai
dealership nohaggle policy is offering an Elantra GLS w power
moonroof for   They also have a Sonata base w Sunroof for
  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w sunroof and
spd automatic  I'll decide which engine I prefer after test
driving both the cyl and the V  The Sonata is also offering a
 rebate  Hmmm that's another question  Is the following
scenario the appropriate manner to handle negotiation

  make offer
  subtract rebate from offer
  talk trade
  subtract trade from offer to get final price

nice theory  too bad the MR's never came with a four cylinder over 
liters  More like   Or did they were the nonturbo MRII's   or
some such

foot in mouth again drew  the first generation mr 's were 's which 
were very smooth  i'd be real surprised if the original poster was talking
about a st generation car  the second generation cars were  for the
non turbo and  for the turbo  i drove the non turbo  and calling it
unpleasant is to be kind to it 

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented designlike Porsche's  I

wrong and wrong  mitsubishi owns the patent which has since expired
which is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance
shafts into their big 's the notable exception is nissan and only
for the us market suckers  i guess we need to write to CD and start
telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm  then
you'll see usenet discussions of the form engine A has peak
vibrations  dB less than engine B therefore engine A is better than
engine B

Long silly discussion deleted

                              And while you're at it why bother with removing
the drain plug when you could remove the dipstick instead and suck it out from
there with your mouth and then spit it out

This suggestion isn't as farfetched as it sounds  Years ago in another
time and place I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive
engines  In many cases there was no way to get any sort of a tray under
the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various
floation chambers on each side  And if you did get something there you'd
spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again

So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out
the dipstick hole  There was a longthin hose on the inlet side designed
to fit down the dipstick tube and another thickershorter hose on the
outlet side that you put into any convenient container  I'm sure these
gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one

This isn't anything new  Back in  I was driving under a high
overpass at night on I in San Diego when I caught a glimpse of
someone on the overpass  As I passed under a rock slammed against the
metal between the winshield and right front window  My girlfriend was
in the seat next to it  I called the police from the next exit but I
doubt if they were found

About five years ago in San Diego someone was put into a coma from a
brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and
subsequently crashed  I don't think he ever came out of the coma and I
haven't heard anything about it for a couple years

I know that this isn't the group for it but since you brought it up
does anyone have any idea why they haven't bombed the Waco cult    

Probably because there are many children there  Also the minor fact
that other than defending themselves from  some people attacking them
they haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
years  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds
for a mass murder of Koresh and his followers

Sorry for posting this to this group but I thought the previous post
needed a rebuttal  If you followup to this portion please crosspost
and direct followups to a more appropriate newsgroup

You moved from Alabama to California  My sympathies

		Black Looks good     K	K
		sp  manual AC 
		Cassette Sun roof 

		White  same as aboove   K	 K


Make sure that they have all maintenance records  Oil should be changed
every  months  The mileage on the cars is fine

Be sure that these have the  valve engine  The  valve  is a

Because I want to get the lowest price possible it's called capitalism

I have news for you  capitalism is the practice of maximizing
profits

Same difference if you lower your costs you increase your profits

Personally I'm not at all bothered by the Saturn pricing scheme  If I
don't want to pay as much as they're selling it for I can go buy a
different car from a different dealer and they get nothing  That's
competition for you  If the dealer can be competitive charging what
they do and making that kind of profit that's capitalism at it's best
and more power to 'em


I'd rather have the consumer dictate what things will cost not the
dealers

Sorry but neither 'dictates' the cost It's a negotiation
Whether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out 
dickering war or more removed on a larger economic scale
ie if saturn can't sell at it's price the price drops
or the company stops building them it remains a negotiated
value controlled by market forces To think that the consumer 
controls price is ludicrous If the consumer controled
price then cars would be freeAnd no one would build 
cars

In defense of the drivers who are in the right lane  Here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of mph  I don't think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the mph limit Do you in the states when you look in the rearview ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a  speed differential  

Dont get me wrong I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right I slow down a tad bit If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential I would be the stupid one

 I've a  mazda  with about  miles on it  Recently I do not get
 a good feeling of the road esp on a wet pavement when driving the car
 It feels as if the car is wandering and there is no grip on the road
 The tires are the original ones and have threads on them passes the
 penny head test  I had the shocks and struts and alignment checked and
 things are fine  However I feel like that I dont have the grip of the
 road and feel as if the car is wandering esp on turns  Any help
 in this is appreciated  Thanks
 

Two shots at it  Check the tires again  if you can see the wear bars
you're down to problem area and some tires pass a penny test between the
bars  that's no guide at all Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning
You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the
tire  so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road

 Tires age In particular soft tire compounds get harder as you put
them thru more heat cycles Harder compounds don't grip as well as
soft ones Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very
often such as in competition but it hits all tires

 Some of 'em aren't fake if you're talking about the Continental kit

The Continental may have been the first modern era auto to mount the
spare on the rear of the car but it was hardly the first car to sport one
Various mounting techniques for rear mounting the spare were quite common
in early automobiles both US and Foreign

The  Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the continental
kit The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside
mounting bracket a continental kit is a very specific ornamentstorage
compartment The  Continental has a neat trunk it looks rather
like a laundry hamper IMHO

WAGON which I have heard is somehow slightly faster than the Coupe

	Wagon has an automatic it's slower

Could be due to the rearend ratio also  

Usually automatics have different rearends than manuals from
my limited experience anyways

You'll have fun looking for the rearend gears on an SHOthe Taurus
is a frontwheeldrive vehicle

I went back and checked the article again The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic but significantly slower than the REAL SHO

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you can't handle a stick you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick eg
disabled persons but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the l
Mustangs Camaros and the like we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars IMHO

   Hi everybody

   I will buy a Honda Civic EX Coupe  The dealer ask  for it
including AC  installed  but not including stereo tax registration
fees  I live in Mexico so I don't have time to go to a lot of dealers
and compare their prices  The dealer is in McAllen Tx  Is this a good
price for that car   If not how much should I pay for it 

   Please email ASAP if you don't want to post  Thanks a lot

 This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience' For  
 crying out loud how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers  
 this way and still stay in business Again I don't expect sales people to  
 bow scrape and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be  
 abused either I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to  
 me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales  
 cubicles Evidently their success rate is high enough that they continue  
 to do business this way There must be a lot of people out there who are  
 easy to intimidate
 

A couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car  Afterwards
we sat down to discuss prices  I explained that I wanted a car just like the
one I drove but in a different color  He said he could get one exactly like
I wanted from the dealer network within a day  We then negotiated a price and
signed the deal

Next day I get a call  He explains that they goofed and they had neglected
to take into account a price increase The last price increase had occurred
over  months prior to my visit  If I still wanted the car I would
have to fork over another   As an alternative they would honor the
price if I bought the car I test drove which had been sitting around for 
 months and had a few miles on it I said goodbye  This was a good
example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts  It's too
bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would
no longer be in business  

The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest  First thing the
salesman said was Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out
how much profit I should make  The deal went through with no problems

If I'm not mistaken altering the odometer is illegal  Furthermore
I surmise it'll be tough to alter BMW's odometer if you got at it
Some of the newer BMW's have electronic odometers making it even
more tamperproof

On the cars mentioned   series from the late 's the electronic
odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer that is driven
by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle  These pulses are 
converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer  and speedometer
No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage
reading  It also means the odometer is just as easy or hard to
change as any other mechanical odometer

On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor
and run the car with no speedometer or odometer readinga simple
switch will do the job  It also will disable the speed limiter
which will enable the car to reach it's full speed

In a previous article gwmsplsplloralcom Gary W Mahan says

Why should a good driver be terrified at mph The only thing I fear
going at  are drivers who switch to the left lane without using
either rearviewmirror or flashers Doing  to  ain't a rush
for me but it's fun and I get where I want to go much faster

In defense of the drivers who are in the right lane  Here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of mph  I don't think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the mph limit Do you in the states when you look in the rearview ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a  speed differential  
Dont get me wrong I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right I slow down a tad bit If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential I would be the stupid one  

just to satiate my curiosity why would this make you the stupid one  It seems
to me everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on  You do not need
to calculate the future position  You need to look at your mirrors a little
more  If you glance around you will be able to tell how much faster than you
the car is going  Maybe not precisely but well enough to know if you should
let him around before you try to pass  I know what you are talking about
about the other driver being startled because i myself have been startled
by drivers cruising by at around mph when i'm doin   The problem
though as i saw it was not their fault for barreling around me but my fault
for not paying the attention to my taskathand that i should have been
Oddly enough since the nd timehappened x in around  mo when i'd had my
liscence for around  mo i haven't been startledand i've been passed by
cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car  Another odd occurance is the
fact that this only seems to happen on LONG tripsand if i drive along with
them it doesn't happen at all  even on the long trips   adrenaline
will do that to youi've had bad cop experiences with speeding so anything
over the limit is adrenalizing for mescared i'll get caught   Maybe
they should raise the limit so we can pay better attention

just curious and my otwo

I can relate to this I've tried everything on my  greasing every point
WD etc Grease on the two cheap hinges on the tailgate seems to quiet it
down for a time until the grease works out of the hinges Hinge pins appear

I just ordered a Saturn SL after considering a few imports Frankly the Saturn
way of doing business and service was a very big plus I hadn't bought a new
car since I bought my Honda WD back in ' and I was unbelieveably offended by
most salespeople I met

Saturn was indeed very different I made three different visits to the dealer where
I bought my car and was never pressured Saturn also had the best aftersales
support and the fixed pricing made it very easy for me to decide exactly what
I wanted to buy Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the
dealer He's been fixing imports for  yearsand bought a Saturn based on
what he's seen and heard from his customers 

Saturn also has a good extended warranty program  for  yearK miles 
fully refunded if you don't use it That works out to an actual cost of  or
so based on the  year treasury rates Using savings account rates it's more
like  In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any
warranty work without counting against the refund

I have to disagree with this  I have a  Z with a  and a speed auto
w overdrive and it is really better that way  Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power  I live 
in the Dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to a manual would be
more fun  

Safetywise an auto is less distractingI would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here
Performancewise I can hold my own against any stock  Mustang or 
Camaro w a five speed  

All of this IMHO

I am considering buying an new car so I called three insurance
companies in California to get estimates I asked for the same
coverage and same deductibles Most of the companies charge you
according to your zip code Others charge according to your city
Anyhow I gave the same zip code and city to all three places Here's
what I found for a ' Integra GS

AAA yr
State Farm yr
Allstate yr

AAA is nonprofit so they said I could also expect to receive about
 back at the end of the year

Still There is a huge gap between all of these companies State Farm
wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate I think I should be
suspicious but I've never heard anybody else complain

Any comments

 My Honda Accord just hit the magic  mile mark and now
 all sorts of things are beginning to go bad The latest problem
 I am experiencing is with my brakes  They still stop the
 car fine but once I am stopped completely my brake pedal
 will sink another  or  inches all by itself  If feels really
 strange and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of
 these days
 
 I checked my brake fluid and the reservoir was full but the
 fluid itself looked really dirty like dirty oil  I called
 my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder
 which will cost me a whopping 

You are not alone  My ' Honda Accord with  miles on it started  
showing the same behavior

I replaced the brake master cylinder myself  It took about an hour and cost  
about   Sure beats paying  to have someone else do it  If I wanted to  
rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one it would  
have cost only  to  for the rebuild kit

The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to  Two bolts attach it to the  
engine compartment  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder  The tricky  
part was that the brake lines were stuck tight  My Craftsmen open end wrench  
rounded off the bolt heads  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers   
Wow  Best invention since sliced bread  After that it was very easy  Bolt  
the new part in place add new brake fluid and bleed the brakes

This is quite easy even for a beginner  My local auto parts store had a repair  
manual for the Honda Accord it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  
cylinder and a stepbystep procedure for replacing it

Now my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's but
I just ordered my first car with an auto trans I wasn't planning on it but
after driving a few I was convinced Things have changed since the days of 
Slip 'n' Slide Withe Powerglide They shift better than I do there's no
clutch to wear out Honda wanted  for my WD wagon last year got it done
for  it only costs about  in gas milage on the highway and it makes it
easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car 

Oddly enough while two of my best friends both in the auto industry here in the 
Motor City have switched wholeheartedly to autos their wives insist on 
manual Shift envy

Braggadocio aside given today's technology and the warranties they're handing 
out the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice Call me a convert

of course the sales man was a fooltitanium wheelsyeah right
then later told me they were magnesiummore believable but still
crap since Al is so m uch cheaper and just as good


i tend to agree tho that this still doesn't take the SHO up to standard
for running  on a regular basis  The brakes should be bigger like
 or sotake a look at the  ones on the Corradoswhere they have
braking regulations

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you can't handle a stick you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick eg
disabled persons but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the l
Mustangs Camaros and the like we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars IMHO

				James

I have to disagree with this  I have a  Z with a  and a speed auto
w overdrive and it is really better that way  Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power  I live 
in the Dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to a manual would be
more fun  

Safetywise an auto is less distractingI would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here
Performancewise I can hold my own against any stock  Mustang or 
Camaro w a five speed  

All of this IMHO 

all of my HO's disagree with your HO's  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick
detested it in the autolike i did any other time in the auto  Of course
Dalls rush hours are nothing from what i hearif i lived in LA i might
be of a different persuasion  And just for the record rarely do you shift
gears when merging into trafficthat is what  speeds are good forth is
good up through around  most of the time so you can just wind it out
it's not going to hurt anything and keeps it in the powerband anyway
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in thfairly rare
unless you drive a ferrari or some such i'd bet or when you hit cruising 
speed where you feel comfortableor when my mother is sitting in the 
passanger seat complaining about how you wind her poor little engine way
too hi 
Just my HO's

All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident
get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact
the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they
would in an accident they caused  Thus no need to go to court  A friend of
mine did this and he got the money so it does work

I'm considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

Don't worry about this  they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim They'll just make filing the claim a pain but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch

I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
guns by police depts I'm not sure where
More than that GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units GEICO started giving them away I
  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol County Sheriff's a
  and some local governments
The real question is why This is the hook GEICO and other Ins Cos can
  tell which drivers represent risk This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK It's called
  extra profits They also know how silly the NSL is and how it is almost
  universally ignored Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket an
  increase in your rates points on your license  but it doesn't make you
  a riskier driver to insure
Like the sound of this Like the people who thought up the scheme Go GEICO

Unless you have some driving history problems you're usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there You'll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums Now about the  of your premium that is paid as
commission That's another story for another day

First off the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division
is Infiniti not Infinity  I would also like to clear up the question
of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles since a
person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models
had V engines while at the same time saying that several of each
manufacturer used V engines

Lexus
  LS V
  GS V
  ES V
  SC V
  SC V

Infiniti
  Q V
  J V
  G inline  I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here

I hope this helps

Ford came out with around January  I can't wait  Anyone out
there hear anything about it recently


If everything I've read is correct Ford is doing nothing but re
skinning the existing Mustang with MINOR suspension modifications
And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job
of it  

The new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a  year old car

Jeff


gee is it  already

Yes it will still be on the fox program chasis anything that will be different
on the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown The suspension will most
likely be changed as well as the drive drain From what has been printed on
it there is no clear idea of what will be done as some say it will have
the modular V and others the current small block just have to wait and see
Also is far as styling goes from what I seen is good a return to tradition
C scoop on the sides and roof line much like a ' or ' fastback

How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local

Hear hear  Thanks Robbie

You also don't read that much about violence against teenagers such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi yearolds
who were trying to surrender with bulldozers


On the other hand I think it is true without singling out teenagers
for blame that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be
Those of us who'd like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages

Well this isn't the right group for this but I have to say that I don't
think violence is any more socially acceptable now by any means  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistoltoting gunslingers as 
heros or even gangland thugs being considered romantic  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians  I don't think so  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then in fact
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California we here 
about it in MA the same day  Back in the old days they'd never hear 
about something like that period

Since the wheeltire is balanced off the car ie the lugnuts are
not normally involved how would they do that I would think that
since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight
difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would
not have any noticable effect on the balance I could be wrong it is

 After agreeing to terms I signed the contract and drove home in my new
 car  Later that same night I noticed that the terms in the were
 different from the terms I had agreed to  I made the stupid mistake
 of not checking everything on the contract  This all happened last
 Saturday
 
 I have heard that there is a coolingoff law allowing me three days
 to reconsider the contract  Is this true  Can anyone point me to the
 law  The transaction happened at the dealership if it matters
 
 This cooling off period applies only in certain situations  lik ewhen
 you are solicited at home  I also think the cooling off period ends
 if you actually accept the merchandise
 
 If this were not the case any car buyer would have the right to return
 a slightly used highly devalued car  days after buying it  Yeah  
 that's the trick  if I want to buy a new car I'd have a firend buy 
  return one then go in and negotiate a better deal on a preowned
 used car

However if you agree some terms and then when about to sign the
dealer slips you a contract with different terms and leads you to
believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to that
is fraud  There is no  day limit on restitution for fraud

You may have to sue and win to get out of this  You will almost
certainly have to threaten to sue

I know this is the wrong place to post this but I couldn't find any
relevant newsgroups in my area

For those of you who are from PA where is VASCAR where the cops
measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance
between two white lines on the road right most commonly used  I'm
especially interested in the Pittsburgh area specific locations prior
experiences if possible  For those PA and nonPA if they use VASCAR
in your state is it most common in rural city highway areas etc 
What I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk
of being caught  You can always detect radar but there's no way to
fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are

Thanks a lot

I've had a Valentine for about  months now and I agree that it is the best det
ector available The point here is trust and reliability I've been able to tr
ust the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend If the Valentine sa
ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me then it's mo
re than likely to be a speed trap With my other detectors I've gotten so many
 falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t
o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal

That directional indicator really really helps Plus more info is almost alwa
ys better than less info No matter how smart radar detectors get the human br
ain is usually smarter So if I'm going to make a decisio based on information
 at hand I want all the info I can get Plus if you divide the overall streng
th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported you'll find that each
bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat With other detectors yo
u'll just get one strong warning My logic may be faulty on this but I think i
t works okay

Although I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of
one radar souce

I agree with Gaia Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car

In my opinion getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough In my case that's be

First off the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division
is Infiniti not Infinity  I would also like to clear up the question
of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles since a
person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models
had V engines while at the same time saying that several of each
manufacturer used V engines

Lexus
  LS V
  GS V
  ES V
  SC V

The GS and SC have an inline

  my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car

I was about to recommend you consider a targa top over a convertible but 
DREW made the point very well  When my wife and I were in our s we
did the convertible thing with Triumphs  Now in our mids we still
appreciate the open air but prefer targa types  There is much less wind
noise objectspapers blowing around foreign objects getting into the
car and one still has almost all the advantages of the convertible  


My last car had TTops BIG TTops  My current car is a convertible
IMHO if you're after that 'convertible feel' TTops opentop
sunroofs moonroofs whatever just don't cut it  There's no
substitute for a convertible  If you're not after that sun beating
down on you the wind in your hair and teeth the flopsum and
jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the
whooshing of the wind you're not after that 'convertible feel'
So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call
it a convertible

And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll
bar in a rollover situation  Of course I'd rather not test it
in MY car  I too am in my early s

A convertibleaccept no substitute

And here's my two cents

The best convertible for the money IMO is the Miata Yes it's small but
you're buying it as a second car I hope so you don't need the cargo room
of a big car It's got enough power for fun it's RWD like a sports car
ought to be I'm gonna regret that  and the top while manual operates
like a dream  seconds and one hand to lower and not much longer to raise

The targatype cars are nice but they're not real convertibles

If you put a locking lugnut on your tires do you need to have your
tires rebalanced

John Mas


EMail Address          MASSKCLAMONSANTOCOM


Well it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have  My previous
car had locking lugnuts that weighed about oz more than the others 
The locking lugnuts were factory equipment and according to the factory
service manual after tire balancing the technicianmechanic was
supposed to put a  oz counterweight on the rim opposite the locking
nut  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no
one ever did the service correctly I eventually got rid of the locking
lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts  Unfortunately I
found out about the counterweighting technique  months after I got rid
of the locking nuts 

My present car a Saturn SC has locking lugnuts that I bought at the
dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn  They have been made to
be exactly the same weight as the nonlocking lugnuts said so on the
package and I verified it myself  I haven't had any vibration problems
with the tires at all due to the nuts in  of ownership  I did
have some other vibration problems but it was due to a poor job of tire
balancing

 something for the trans in my   Pulsar SE it was  about k miles but
 it had a weak  tranny in the first place

Please explain the why of this I have over k miles usage of clutchless
shift and no problems

	The VillagerQuest seem like the best of the CravanVoyager
	copies to come along since the Mazda MPV

I'll agree about villager but not MPV  it's so small that I'd class
it as a SUV with an extra seat shoehorned in  To get any rear cargo
space you shove the back seat up against the middle seat eliminating
all leg room

Back to the Villager 

	Only the price is controversial

And the use of attack belts instead of point belts  That killed it
for me

  I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
  gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
  Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX
  
  But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
  something about legislation being discussed to clean up
  diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
  install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
  of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
  different than a catylitic converter  I'd assume easier
  since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
  gasses  Let's hear people's opinions

 This really bugs me  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle
 but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars
 in California  What a bunch of crap  Diesel is the fuel of choice for 
 enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason
 
 The particulates are nothing but carbon  They are just an annoyance at worst
 Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions torque or engine
 durability  It's also cheaper

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels  The main reason
they are considered cleaner is because they are better at the emissions we
actually measure and regulate  But they also contribute additional emissions
which have long been determined to be as harmful but no suitable control or
limits have been defined  

Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
and suspended particles and less of a photochemical reaction  Diesel particulates
are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity  And alcohols emit
signifcantly more aldehydes a known carcinigen than gasoline  The evidence
is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death we may
have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives

And anyone who thinks diesels are so great should go and spend a few hours in
rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe  There the stench of the diesels is
awful and it can even burn the eyes  

Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards

If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster which
gauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set

I consider the basic set to be

	 tach

	 coolant temp or cylinder head temp for aircooled engines
	 oil pressure
	 amps

	 speedo
	 fuel

others that are nice to have

	 volts maybe this should be in the basic set
	 vacuumboost

I can think of a few others but what are your ideas and why

After agreeing to terms I signed the contract and drove home in my new
car  Later that same night I noticed that the terms in the were
different from the terms I had agreed to  I made the stupid mistake
of not checking everything on the contract  This all happened last
Saturday

I have heard that there is a coolingoff law allowing me three days
to reconsider the contract  Is this true  Can anyone point me to the
law  The transaction happened at the dealership if it matters

This cooling off period applies only in certain situations  lik ewhen
you are solicited at home  I also think the cooling off period ends
if you actually accept the merchandise

If this were not the case any car buyer would have the right to return
a slightly used highly devalued car  days after buying it  Yeah  
that's the trick  if I want to buy a new car I'd have a firend buy 
 return one then go in and negotiate a better deal on a preowned
used car

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

On the other hand if it can be proven it's possible the changed 
terms could be thrown out  The question will be whether the 
agreement contains a merger clause  See UCC   parol 
evidence  If we're talking about warranties then of course 
UCC   should be looked at

But we have so little information that none of us can say anything 
conclusive

 I'm not familiar with the trannies used in Winston Cup but in the transam
 cars I've played with the  transmissions were the racing variety with
 dog clutches instead of sychros  In a transmission with dog clutches the
 gears are always  engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches
 engages the gears to the shafts  Motorcycle transmissions are the same way
 Shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause
 transmission damage the only question being how long it  takesto grenade
 something for the trans in my   Pulsar SE it was  about k miles but
 it had a weak  tranny in the first place
 
 just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro
 transmission  What you described SOUNDS the same to me  In fact what little
 i've studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs
 and said they were synonymous  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
 gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting Or at least
 that is what i was taught  Explain por favour

Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros  The engagment dogs are very
corse and sloppy  There are maybe  teeth dogs on the side of the
gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back
and forth  To shift  start to apply pressure at the same time the
clutch is pulled the clutch is a hand lever and shift quickly  If 
you try a slow lazy shift it will grind you just have to pop it into
the next gear before it has a chance to grind  There isn't a neutral
between gears obviously there is but you can't select it with the
shifter so double clutching is not a possibility  speed shifting
which is what I have always heard clutchless shifting called works
pretty well for upshifts with some practice but I usually use the
clutchespecially for the lower gears

I think auto as in automobile trannys are similar except that the
engagment dogs are very fine with no slop  And the addition of
syncho rings  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions
that are synchronized but may not be in nonsynchro gears reverse
and sometimes first

I have tested both vehicles identically
equipped both for weeklong periods
Curiously and consider these are test
vehicles I found the Mercury higher
in build quality than the Nissan

Either choice is good but beware that
I did not experience reasonable mileage
with the V  Average city driving was
mpg with about  avg on the highway

Both were optioned to the hilt the Nissan
had leather  The Villager was in the
K range and the Nissan was over K

 You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in

 Yes but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot
 
 all they have to do is reach underneath turn a valve and forget the trip

 But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut It works great 
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every  miles
Works for me I must say 


Either I've just fallen for this or you guys
are really paranoid

You're actually worried about somebody stealing 
your oil

C'mon you think a vandal'll do that

That's absolutely ridiculous

Besides how hard is it to get under the car to 
change the oil

I can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and
changed the oil on my Mazda  is pretty much a pain but
once you've done it once you don't forget how and it
gets easier

I can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine

 A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
at least every other year if not every year  Since he has been using S
he has went  years without an overhaul

Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with K
miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time  These coustomers
had ran S since almost new  It was found when measuring the internals
of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
expected of K miles not K

How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children seniors the homeless

Hear hear  Thanks Robbie

You also don't read that much about violence against teenagers such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi yearolds
who were trying to surrender with bulldozers


On the other hand I think it is true without singling out teenagers
for blame that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be
Those of us who'd like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages

Well this isn't the right group for this but I have to say that I don't
think violence is any more socially acceptable now by any means  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistoltoting gunslingers as 
heros or even gangland thugs being considered romantic  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians  I don't think so  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then in fact
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California we here 
about it in MA the same day  Back in the old days they'd never hear 
about something like that period 

Yeah People act really shocked about violence as though it were new
to our species

What about the holocaust The crusades The Salem witch trials The
religious persecutions of the middleages 

What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over
the world What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans
The Jews persecuted by Christians

There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been I do not
know the stats but there are far more people on the planet than there
were  or  hundred years ago The per capita acts of violence are
probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a
thousand years ago

There is nothing new about violence

No comparison The BEL is just a hooped up wideband Escort like detector

ADVICE on SATURN EXTENDED WARRANTY


  I placed an order for a Saturn SL and it is expected next week The
Saturn retailer gave me some pamphlets about the extended warranty plan
and I have been thinking about it Being a first time new car buyer I am
seeking advice from veterans esp those who have bought Saturns lately
FYI I have listed some of the features of the Saturn extended warranty plan
The car comes with a  years mile bumpertobumper warranty

Plan I

Extended Powertrain Coverage

Covers the cost of repairs to
   Engine
   Transaxle
   Front wheel drive
  hour roadside assistance program

Coverage Term yearsmiles

Deductible               
               
                               


i say extended warranties are a ripoff highprofit item for dealers
but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying
k k k  you get yrk free  so what you are buying is
k k k  keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs coverage
another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are
out of warrantywhy  designmanufacturing defects that the company owns up
to keeping customer happy etc

 I find this method much better myself too although I do really
 hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
 hand both come crashing into my face  After coming to which is
 about  minutes later I change my clothes because by this time
 all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck
 down about  Tylenol to ease the pain  Later in the day I then
 proceed with refilling the engine oil
 
 It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
 weekendI go through about  bottles of Tylenol and  bags of ice

Oh that's not so bad Every time I try to change the oil I forget to
shut off the engine first The hot oil comes out and scalds me blinds
me then the engine starts to overheat and while I'm screaming in agony
and trying to crawl out from under the car I grab the red hot exhaust
pipe and get third degree burns on my hands My screams intensify as I
finally emerge from under the car and I struggle to my feet in front of
the car whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super
heated coolant Then the engine seizes but not before the cylinder head
explodes piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron

This happens every time I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic
 instead paying the hospital  and the dealer  for a new
car This gets costly when you change the oil every  miles

I'm in the market for a new car  Currently I own a ' Mazda MX DX
which has served me just fine  However I'd like to get
a door car since I don't relish the thought of moving a carseat
around in a door car  My criteria are door ac amfm cassette
quick acceleration cruise control decent rear seat legroom my
husband is a footer  It must also be under k
preferably closer to the k range which will probably rule out
the Accord  The ' cars that have caught my eye are Toyota Corolla 
Toyata Camry Mazda  Pontiac Grand Am Pontiac Grand Prix 
Honda Accord and Civic if it's roomy enough and still comes in a 
door model Hyundai Sonata and maybe even a small Oldsmobile 
although not the Achieva  All opinions benchmarks
recommendations etc are welcome

The Civic does still come in a  door model  My wife and I looked
quite seriously at the  Prizm Corolla and Civic as well as
some other cars  Our impressions all three seemed well built and had
the features we wanted  these are similar to the features you want
except for cruise control and we want a manual transmission and are
considering antilock brakes  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we
both think having an airbag is a plus  In general comfort and
performance were both significant

Some specific 's and 's are listed below

Mazda 
  very comfortable and roomy
  can theoretically get ABS on DX model though in practice this is
   hard to find
  base price for base model includes numerous little things like
   tach variable speed wipers rear defroster  split folding rear seat
  more expensive than many other cars listed below

Honda Civic
  DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
  comfortable front seat
  adjustable seat belt mounting
  no ABS without EX model includes 's of other things like a sunroof

Geo PrizmToyota Corolla
  seats not very comfortable to us your mileage may vary
  adjustable seat belt mounting
  can get ABS without lots of other extras

Saturn
  SL was quite comfortable though SL less so
  motorized attack belts

Dodge Spirit
   no real outstanding 's but seemed generally ok
  rear seat does not fold down

Chevy Corsica
  comes with ABS standard
  lower would you buy that car again and safety ratings in
   Consumer Reports than first  cars above
  suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others this would be a 
   for some

The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the
 and in our minds not significantly better

We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the big 
due a to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products
b some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate
of mine c the Taurus comes with automatic transmission I find the
seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable and the escort has attack belts
and no air bag

We'll probably end up with a   I saw a  DX with AC and
cassette advertised for just under  Washington Post April 
I think and my local dealer says they can match that price  I will
probably get the  maybe tomorrow  The main question in my mind
is whether or not I will have to do a factory order or preference
order to get one with ABS and whether or not the dealership will
run the price up a lot if I do so

I agree with Gaia Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car
so far a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind

this is an interesting point  some people are not really buying the coverage
they are buying 'peace of mind' marketing folks love selling that  i suggest
that people choose to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than
buying that 'peace of mind'

In my opinion getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough In my case that's be
cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof windows doors
 etc I could do myself I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such

you'd be surprised how much the little knickknack stuff can cost  what if 
your ac goes out  steering rack  don't get me wrongi'm against all
extended warrantiesthey are a ripoff

Plus I think the extra  years of hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so
meting I opted for the  year plan for 
extra  yrs  you realize the first yrk is free warranty that comes with 
the car

I too was puzzled by this obvious untruth What I think is going on is that
Nissan claims that the Altima is the best selling new car namelplate in
the US I think I have this near verbatim Lee Iaccoca's statistics
dept would have been proud of that sentence

Note that the CorollaPrism are also new designs but hey are not new 
nameplates  I guess Nissan doesn't even sell as many Altimas as
Toyota does Corollas or there would be no nameplate qualifier

But waiiiiiit isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as
government paperwork goes Nissan Stanza Altima to avoid costly and
lengthy paperwork I read this on the net a while ago and someone
actually may have said there's a little Stanza logo on the Altima
somewhere

You can have it both ways

 In response to a post about SUV's I got several unsolicited recommendations to
 check out the Land Cruiser despite its astronomical price
 The Toyota dealer told me it's a cult car
 If a car is good enough to create a passionate and loyal following there
 must be something really extraordinary about it
 So all you Land Crusher Cultists  here is your chance to convert me

Based on my experience with a ' FJ  the hardtop jeepstyle model  I 
would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market The
older models are VERY well built Unless Toyota lost its mind I would
assume until  proven otherwise that the newer models have inherited some
if not all of the qualities of their ancestors

Two major differences in the running gear that I'm aware of need study
My ' has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
independant front suspension The solid axle is theoretically stronger and
more reliable than the newer model but only experience will tell The
independant front suspension is no doubt a compromise made to satisfy
the typical user who will never need a real utility vehicle The second
difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models I'm
not sure but I think Tioyota went to a fulltime WD or allwheel drive
system The older Landcruisers have a lockup type Both have their
advantages and disadvantages

I figure that mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are
lots of lowspeed collisions that do worry me

Get into an  mph accident and you may reconsider I've been in one
and it is really scarey My life is something I value more
than a car's looks or handeling Consider it insurance it may not
happen often but when it does you'll sure be glad you got a safe car

Granted the tests aren't perfect but I'd much rather be in a car that
did well in the test than a car that did horribly 

You raise a valid point but again it's a tradeoff  how much money
do you want to spend for that kind of protection  You could buy a
Volvo Saab or 'Benz and get really good crash protection and other
luxuries but you'll pay significantly more for it  In my case it's
out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget

Even in highspeed headon collisions the most beneficial item you can
have is a good old point seatbelt  Nowadays at least in the US
you get an airbag if you get a point belt so presumably you get an
added safety benefit there as well  That's something I certainly look
for and which can be had in inexpensive cars

My  of course

There is no question that the Valentine  has good range but
not significant enough to be  or  times as expensive as some of the
others

The big win with the V is not its range but rather its
directionality and multipletransmitter tracking which you later
called a gimmick  a conclusion I disagree with  Since the
detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's
significantly more expensive  While the added capabilities may not
help you there is added value for those of us who live in areas where
there are a lot of falsealarms

Summary Valentine way too expensive and not a significantly better
performer

I certainly call it interesting but I'm another person who thinks
that the added value might be coming at too high a cost  Very
adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and
one of them has suited me rather well  If I did more longdistance
travelling in areas I'm not familiar with I'd probably consider
getting the V because it's additional information would be useful in
discriminating false alarms

Subject Dealer cheated me with wrong odometer reading Need help

Here is a story  I bought a car about two weeks ago  I finally can
get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence
history of the car  In between ' and ' the instrument pannel 
of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset
to zero  Therefore the true meter reading is the reading before
replacement plus current mileage  That shows  mile difference
comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from  The 
dealer never told me anything about that important story

I hope that I can return the car with full refund  Do u think this
is possible  Does anyone have similar experiences  Any comments
will be appreciated  Thanks

Something that happened in South AFrica about a year ago A dealer sold a 
Mercedes with an odometer reading of K kilometers to a lady Turned out 
that the actual reading should have been K Court case followed because
lady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's Dealer found 
quilty fined and had to take back the car

I think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous
owner Take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something

Subject Is car saftey important 
   I was recently thumbing through the  LemonAid New
Car Guide  What I found was a car would be given a 'Recommended'
under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a
driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed
in a front end collision  The most highly recommended small
car The Civic has the worst crash rating of all of the small
cars listed  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles
where you wouldn't survive an accident  Is it only me or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car


Definitely

Safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car I won't buy a 
small car like a Civic or whatever

Great  Safety  Handling  Speed    for me

Seems to me that you would be more dead in a small car than a large car 
after an accident

After a tip from Gary Crum crumfcomccutahedu I got on the Phone
with Pontiac Systems or Pontaic Customer Service or whatever and
inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and
Trans Am  BTW Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me
nowhere  After being routed to a Firebird Specialist I was able
to confirm that this is in fact the case

At first there was some problem with the  performance axle ratio
She wouldn't go into any details so I don't know if there were some
shipped that had problems or if production was held up because they
simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier  As I say she
was pretty vague on that so if anyone else knows anything about this
feel free to respond  Supposedly this problem is now solved

Second there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related
to the sixspeed Manual transmission  So as of this posting there is
a production hold on these cars  She claimed part of the delay was
not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car and therefore
having to wait for the right high quality parts  I'm not positive
that this applies to the Camaro as well but I'm guessing it would

Can anyone else shed some light on this

First off the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division
is Infiniti not Infinity  I would also like to clear up the question
of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles since a
person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models
had V engines while at the same time saying that several of each
manufacturer used V engines

Lexus
  LS V
  GS V
  ES V
  SC V
  SC V

The GS and SC have an inline 


Infiniti
  Q V
  J V
  G inline  I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here

Inline  is correct


I hope this helps

We were at a dealership today looking at buying a car and
the salesman was showing us something he was calling a
buy back  Is that a car that was fleeted and then
given back for the new model the next year  If that
is so how many miles is a good number to have on it
and are these types of cars generally a good buy

no not 'stealing' the oil just draining it as to leave me stranded

C'mon you think a vandal'll do that

Let me guess you're from Hudson Ohio

That's absolutely ridiculous

Get out and see the world


IF I were the vandal and I really hated someone maybe someone who knew
something about cars of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could
undo  Especially special oil drain plugs and radiator petcocks

As well as putting bad things in the gas

While I would never vandalize someone's car IF I were to it would probably

if this is a standard measure for negotiating a resale price or if i
can hope to get more money from someone else  what exactly is blue book
value based on  i know that for its year  my car has low mileage
   it is in excellent working condition but does have a few

just naturally want to get the best price for the car

thanks a million

	I think the Blue Book is the NADA handbook for used car prices no
	Is the Blue Book value given the retail or wholesale value  The 
	Blue Book value isn't set in stone though  Low milage extra addons
	and stuff like that there can increase the resale price of the car you

	Blue Book and read up on that sort of stuff  I paid  under BB
	retail for my ' Civic in  and it was in perfect condition and

A mileage chart should be available in the book  It usually goes by
the class of car you own and year  Usually you will end up adding a few
hundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it  Consumer
Reports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area
A friend of mine used it and was quite happy with the service  I
believe it cost about

Hi
I need your help with a problem I have with a  Mitsubishi
Galant GS transmission  The car has a  speed manual tranmission
Since the car was bought new while shifting from nd to rd  unless 
I do it SLOWLY and carefully it makes a popping or hitting sound
The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service reached by an   say 
this is NORMAL for the car  IS IT
And about a year ago at Kmiles the stick shift handle got STUCK
while attempting to put it in reverse
    The shifter would not budge  The clutch had no effect
    The front tires would not budge even when the clutch is
      fully depressed
    If the clutch is released the engine would die
    Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was
      stuck I could not make the car move  It acted as if
      it were in Neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released
    I finally was able to release the shifter by having 
      someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch
      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter
    The shifter acted normally after that

When this happened I took it to the dealer they checked the 
clutch it was ok They checked the transmission it was ok

I had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again last
week  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because 
Mitsubishi the   says they have never heard of the
problem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while
they had the car  
In all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garage
and since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towed
to the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarily
solving the problem  And the dealer and Mitsubishi refused to
send someone to check the car while it was stuck 
I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting 
from nd to rd and getting stuck at random but I can't get 
the dealer to fix it I need your help with the mechanical problems 
and with how to handle Mitsubishi  
All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated and sorry to
bore you with the long post

Thanks
Rabih


Try another dealer  Sometimes the sophistication of equipment etc is
better at one dealer than another  You may also find another dealer
willing to help you with the problem

But why not turn the question around why are automatics so common in

Because some people like them and some people actually need them

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torquerich
V's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress and that this has just lived on

Yeah right Real muscle cars had a manual transmission and their
clutches aren't that heavy ShelbyAmerican used plenty of
highpowered hightorque engines and Carroll only put autos in
his cars because people wanted them Blasphemers Heretics
Burn them burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto 
Real Cobras and they were the ultimate sports car at the
time had bigblock Fords which turned out prodigious amounts
of power and torque and none of them had automatics 

And also an automatic with a V engine can be real fun to drive

Yeah if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve fun

 I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded

 State Police be hanged

Carrying a pistol loaded or unloaded in the glove compartment is
considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without
a concealed weapons permit  Unless the law has been changed recently
carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal
I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a
traffic infraction and observed a  magnum revolver sitting on the
seat  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon
because it was not concealed  The article stated that if the gun had
been discovered in the glove box it would have been considered a crime

Carrying in the glove box is not coveredI'm not sure what I was 
thinking there It is legal in Oklahoma 

On interstate travel as long as it is legal for you to own
at your point of origination and destination the gun is carried
in a locked compartmentbox glove box specifically excluded separate
from the ammo it is legal under Title  Chapter  Section  I
forget and my copy of the regs is at home of the US Code This
unfortunately has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
certain state which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
stupid under that state's law

Gee and I thought Federal Law overrode state law

	Are there any MR owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why
my MR's engine sounds noisy The MR's engine is noisy at the best of times 
but not even a nice nose  it's one of those very ugly noises 

assuming yours is a non turbo MR the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline  that doesn't have balance shafts  i guess toyota
didn't care about little details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling

myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or
recommendation which has an inline  larger than  liters and no
balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine  

if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V


eliot

nice theory  too bad the MR's never came with a four cylinder over 
liters  More like   Or did they were the nonturbo MRII's   or
some such

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented designlike Porsche's  I

 Actually the roads were designated as safe at  when they were built
 in the 's taking into account the kinds of cars then available The
 number would be much higher today because the cars tires and just about
 everything else has imprivoved a lot

Except the drivers

I bought a set of ARE's a few months back and decided to add locks
so that I could keep my new rims I haven't had a balance problem 
yet so I assume that it might be just particular to your type of

Here's what you posted earlier in another thread  Before you thrash
others for making simple mistakes or flaunt your wonderful vi skill
think about how you make them feel as well as how you look you spelled

For years you have assaulted others with offensive language etc  From

For a reasonable sum you can get a BMW with traction control
a torquesensing limited slip rear differential  Since no
FWD car including the Saab has this kind of front differential
since it would exacerbate torque steer a BMW with traction control
should have the theoretical advantage on snow  Of course weight

If I'm going to drive on a public road then I need a
speedometer and an odometer helps for navigation
 
My  Chevy has a bare minimum  Enginetemp and
Oilpress warning lights and a fuel gauge 

My  VW has tach watertemp voltmeter 
and oiltemp gauges 
 
If I had a turbo car I'd want a vacuum manifoldboost
gauge  An oil pressure gauge is a nice reassuring
gauge to look at  If my car was air cooled then I
would substitute a cylheadtemp gauge for the watertemp

The gauge layout from left to right top to bottom was

traction control as far as the optional feature that one buys with
cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential

a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD but not all LSD's
are torque sensing  viscous coupled differentials as opposed to
viscous couplings are rotational sensing not torque sensing
for that matter so are traction control systems that use ABS
sensors and pulse braking

then there are the older positracs and whatever which i am not
familiar with the workings

Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's  Ford Probe  Every
once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  I would guess this usually happens
after a good thunder storm  A few Qs

 Is this a common problem

Yes this is a common problem  The leaks occur through the seal of the 
taillights  Unfortunately Ford has this with Most Probes and does
not have a recall for it  Very dissatisfying to say the least

 Where are the drain holes located for the hatch

There is no drain holes that I know of  I used a margine tub to drain it
Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn't fix it
under warrantee  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system
including a balancemotion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in 
the trunk  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioningthey would
not retract  So I ended up paying about  to have the sensor replaced 
 to have the tail lights resealed they firts replaced the hatch gasket
which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that
when I proved to be right not to mention the water damage to the 
covers to the trunkspare com partment and algae in the taillights

very annoying  Don't let the water problem goget it fixed or you'll pay
more later  Considering how common a problem it is I hope every one
complains to Ford

Thanks for any info

 Some comments
 
 a Good performance and mid and high speeds can be obtained by adjusting the
    top gear and final drive ratios Contrary to popular misperception a 
    number of Japanese cars have quite good performance from  in top
    gear 

No problem with that  The question is  do they perform consistently in all
conditions roads winds and curves at that speed and do so for hours on end 
year after year without giving the driver white knuckles  From my experience on 
the AutobahnsAutostrade a good touring car can be easily distinguished by its 
poise at mph  The best stay on cruise control at  for hours  I've
seen the typical boy racer in a Fiat try to keep up  Sure they hit the century
mark but if the wind blows the wrong way they change lanes and if on an
overpass they may fly right into a guardrail  The buffeting at  can be
severe enough to  make the hood bend  Tires at  can melt and a pothole can
kill  Many German cars are designed for this environment even if they can't
seem to get out of their own way from a stop light Mercedes come to mind in
particular  And another design point is fuel economy at those speeds  The
Germans gear the car for very good high speed efficiency a typical MB E turns
 at  almost a stall 

Good point I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at  mph
nor do they reach  However using high' to be  mph

a They are quite amenable to long high speed drives I've done several
k mile trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever The last big trip
I made was driving from New York to Texas I remember driving 
miles a day at typically  mph  without any problems I'm sure I  
would have been more comfortable driving a benz but no white knuckles
No problems with winds and curves 

Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras  where
we were doing  all the way to Houston No problems

b Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds I see
no difference between sustained  mph and sustained mph On the trip
back from New Orleans we got about  mpg in my Integra quite ok Mind
you the engine revs to almost k at  The civic is markedly better
than the Integra in fuel economy k miles down the road I still
get  mpg at  mph driving


 b I can't understand why these highscale European marquees are afraid
    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in
    the low gears I have been doing that for that last k miles with
    my lowly Civic with no detriment to either the engine or the clutch
    and getting excellent mpg to boot I'd call this an engineering hack
    to cover up design deficiencies

At k miles you'd still be breakingin a highscale European marquee  They 
typically are designed to last  miles per engine  mi per
chassis The record is now over  miles on a Benz diesel and I've
read about transmissions lasting  miles  Speaking of

Now now you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine I see enough
bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have k miles on them and advertise 
rebuilt engines If honda was to build an accord for k I'd darn well
expect the sucker to last k miles

diesels they have very good efficiency at the cost of acceleration and are very
popular in all European cars diesel is considered the green fuel from the
smallest econoboxes to the luxobarges  Again we see a difference in mentality
Diesels in the US are considered slightly worse than useless and extremely
dirty to boot so you can't give them away

Ever got caught behind a early 's SDL at a stop light It's not
pleasant The newer MB's are a lot better though The diesel Volvos
and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders

As for economy why should we care Gas is cheap I personally wouldn't
buy a diesel car for any reason  what does it buy me

mike

in general extended warranties are a ripoff  this yrk is really only
yrk because you get the yrk one free with the car  also is there
perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty
also are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty
and if you use it at year  for some  buck job and pay a  deduct and then
you have used it so no refund ever
again extended warranties are ripoff high profit items for the dealer

also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

I'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true
Has anyone out there with Geico made a claim  I'd be interested in
hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether
you then had trouble renewing your policy

I'm also interested in any good or bad stories about Liberty Mutual or

 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than what's included in the base price But on the other hand he 
didn't rent it from Alamo

Probability that I'll be needing more insurance

Unless you have an accident you won't need more

Hello

      Does anyone know how to take out the bolt under the engine
compartment  Should I turn clockwise or counter  I tried any kind
of lubricants WDetc but I still failed
      Do you think I can use a electric drill change to a suitable
bit  to turn it out  If I can succeed can I retighten it not too
tight is it safe without oil leak

You shouldn't need any power tools to undo it an electric drill
probably won't give you much extra torque anyway  WD will help
things that are seized due to rust but this is unlikely for a drain
plug  You should be able to undo it with a spanner  When it
loosens it will probably become very loose and you will bash your
knuckles on the underside of the car  this is the price you must
pay for doing you own work

No that's the price you pay for not knowing how to use a
wrench  You want to pull the wrench towards you away from
painful knuckle splitting hard things  If you can't pull it
because things are in the way push it with an open hand

I find this method much better myself too although I do really
hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
hand both come crashing into my face  After coming to which is
about  minutes later I change my clothes because by this time
all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck
down about  Tylenol to ease the pain  Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil

It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekendI go through about  bottles of Tylenol and  bags of ice

 Does Porsche have a patent on the targa name
 I mean convertible to me means top down which the del Sol certainly
 does NOT do  It has the center that lifts out  This is what i would
 term a targaunless Porsches was gonna sue me for doing that  I know
 the rear window rolls down but i still can hardly consider this car
 to be a convertible
 
 DREW

Here we go

No of course Porsche doesn't have a patent on the targa name  If that were
the case what would Fiat do  I suppose that technically my del Sol is not a
convertible in the literal sense but it certainly classifies as an open
topped car  In addition the rear section behind the removable top is what
makes my car infinately safer than a convertible

  greetings
  you may be in luck  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of
the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a
mould sp off a real kubel and has adapted it to the beetle
floorpan  as for the suspension all i can remember about the
vw thing i used to own is that it had about  more suspension
travel than a stock beetle but i'd heard that there were after
market parts for offroad use that were as good or better  note
that the major difference looks wise between a kubel  a thing
are the hood and the fenders  the kubel had an external spare
mounted on the hood and the hood sloped down for visibility
sharply and had rounded fenders  the thing has a lightly sloped 
hood with the spare mounted inside unless moved to make for more
luggage space and has halfhexagon shaped fenders imagine a
nut large enough to put a tire in and cut off the bottom half
of it
  unfortunately i don't have that info anymore  try stopping
at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the
two big mag's and calling them  they might be able to get the
number for you don't forget to calculate the time difference to
norway before calling

Here is a story  I bought a car about two weeks ago  I finally can
get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence
history of the car  In between ' and ' the instrument pannel 
of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset
to zero  Therefore the true meter reading is the reading before
replacement plus current mileage  That shows  mile difference
comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from  The 
dealer never told me anything about that important story

I hope that I can return the car with full refund  Do u think this
is possible  Does anyone have similar experiences  Any comments
will be appreciated  Thanks

This is a tricky situation if the previous owner didn't inform
the dealer of the odometer change then the previous owner committed
fraud and he may be liable The dealer may also be liable If the
previous owner notified the dealer or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered  If a dealer changes the speedometer he has
to report it it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer
and on the title if I remember correctly the dealer told me that
the old mileage etc were sent to Ford when my TBird's speedo 
was replaced If the odometer can be set to the old mileage it must 
be if it can't eg electricallydriven odometers then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle 

Either way if the change had been done legally then a records search
which the dealer almost certainly did should have turned it up

It did it again  This morning my  Ford Ranger was idling at  RPM
Ok so I exaggerated a little but it was idling very fast  It has a 
liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would
cause the idle to drop back to normal I don't think the linkage is stuck
What can I do to fix this problem  This has been a problem from time to
time but has straightened itself out  until now  I don't have a tach
but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast
as it should be  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up
at a stop light

Sometimes a bad choke pulloff diaphram will cause a car to fast idle The
pulloff which is vacuum actuated provides a necessary pull in noncold
weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam Locate the
fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a
normal idle If so locate the diaphram and test it If you can't apply
suction via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose with your mouth that will
cause the diaphram to retract then it's bad and should be replaced

all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck
down about  Tylenol to ease the pain  Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil

It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekendI go through about  bottles of Tylenol and  bags of ice

 Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's  Ford Probe  Every
 once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
 under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  I would guess this usually  
happens
 after a good thunder storm  A few Qs
 
  Is this a common problem
  Where are the drain holes located for the hatch

I noticed this is my ' probe also when recently cleaning out the back  I  
think the water is coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the  
spare  Mine looked slightly worn and there was no water or water damage above  
the level of the spare area 

This has taken a low priority since I just found out while rotating my tires  
that I have a torn CV boot  ugh

I've got an  GT  It has the smoked taillight assembly  I think this is where
the water is getting in  When I first got it had it for a month one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly  It happened to the other one about  months later  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it  But I convinced them to
fix it  They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps or the trunk for the last 
years but just last month the taillamp just fogged up again  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it  This is
getting very annoying Almost every other  GT I've seen has had this problem

I figure that mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are
lots of lowspeed collisions that do worry me

Get into an  mph accident and you may reconsider I've been in one
and it is really scarey My life is something I value more
than a car's looks or handeling Consider it insurance it may not
happen often but when it does you'll sure be glad you got a safe car

Granted the tests aren't perfect but I'd much rather be in a car that
did well in the test than a car that did horribly 

You raise a valid point but again it's a tradeoff  how much money
do you want to spend for that kind of protection  You could buy a
Volvo Saab or 'Benz and get really good crash protection and other
luxuries but you'll pay significantly more for it  In my case it's
out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget

I've been in two major auto accidents both were multiple car  The worst
was a headon three car collision T intersection and one person ran a stop
sign  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go and I saw it
coming both times 

Even in highspeed headon collisions the most beneficial item you can
have is a good old point seatbelt  Nowadays at least in the US
you get an airbag if you get a point belt so presumably you get an
added safety benefit there as well  That's something I certainly look
for and which can be had in inexpensive cars

If you really want to add safety to any car simply add a cage to the
car  They are available and cheap about  in the USA  Add to that
four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that
were otherwise not survivable  but instead of people spending a little
extra money we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal
level of protection for everyone 

One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some
training  This will improve your safety more than any other single
investment will  Driveride defensively and that does not mean you have
to be a doddering old stick in the mud  People here tend to enthuse about
autos more than the average probably in the top th percentile in driving
ability but still we sometimes overlook the obvious  I've been to two
driving schools and three riding schools for my motorcycle  A very
worthwhile investment and besides it was a lot of fun too  

Safety is what you make of it just because a carmaker doesn't provide you
with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at
that

Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing
the oil yourself

Also I have about  miles on my i and so far only one of the five
yellow service indicators went out That means I don't need oil service until
it reach approximatly  miles which doesn't make sense to me Any idea

PS of cause I did my first oil change at  miles

 As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while 
 here in Europe they are rare Just wondering

In many of our cities there are traffic signals every  feet unsynchronised
of course well here in Ottawa anyway and the roads are so congested that 
shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot  Also most Canadians are
too stupid to learn how to shift manually gee I gotta coordinate my two
feet on the clutch brake and accelerator and I gotta steer shift and
operate the signals optional and radio with my two hands duh it 
can't be done  Also most North American made cars come with the automatic 
as standard equipment so why bother with a manual when the car can shift 
for you for no addition money

The Event

 The Joliet Mud Turtles a Chicago land four wheel drive club is
  sponsoring an OnOff Road Rally Sunday April th

 For those who ask What is an onoff road rally well

  An OnOff Road Rally consists of the following

    An ontheroad rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      JolietPlainfield area  The object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues  Participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way  Points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given  Directions will ultimately 
      lead to an offroad area where a fourwheel drive course is 
      setup  At various locations in the onroad course checkpoints
      will be setup where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity eg tire roll truck tow
      basketball freethrow etc for additional points

    An optional offroad four wheel drive course where participants
      will navigate offroad trails mud bogs andor hill climbs
      Points are awarded for successfully navigating offroad obstacles
      without getting stuck  If you should get stuck which is half
      the fun anyway there will be assistance to get your vehicle
      unstuck so you can try it again  The offroad course will
      divided up based on tire size so stock xs as well as modified
      xs can run the course
     
  At the end of the rally trophies will be awarded to top scoring
  participants  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out
  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion

 This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles
  so safety and fun is our foremost concern  All xs must be
  street legal and have solid tow points for the offroad section
  of the course  we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper
  from their vehicle

Compare either to the Porsche  and you tell me which was designed
to go fast

you have a point about the brakes especially seeing as how the
mustang doesn't even have disc brakes in the back  
but there are significant differences between the latest s and
the late 's s not the least of which is handling  i'm not
          

I think you mean late 's  The biggest change that Porsche undertook to
alter the tailhappieness of their baby was way back in August  for the
' model year when they stretched the wheelbase  Besides some people
actually KNOW how to take advantage of oversteer and enjoy it

in europe  the  got low marks for high speed handling though to
be fair they might have been comparing it to the vette's handling
                                                   

what was that phil hill famous race car driver said about the
                

You should have seen what Phil Hill WORLD CHAMPION had to say about
the Vette's he's driven 

 turbo  you can't make a thoroughbred out of a pig but you can
have an awful fast pig
           

Yeah that was what he said  

Paul Frere agreed  They both prefered the Porsche modified by Ruf to
either of the Vette's at that test

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the l
Mustangs Camaros and the like we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars IMHO

				James

I have to disagree with this  I have a  Z with a  and a speed auto
w overdrive and it is really better that way  Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power  I live 
in the Dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to a manual would be
more fun  

I don't know if it's as much an issue of their ablility to handle the
power as it is the power they lose in the torque converter etc

Safetywise an auto is less distractingI would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here
Performancewise I can hold my own against any stock  Mustang or 
Camaro w a five speed  

However if you encounter a ' Formula with L  Speed Manual
You'll be SOL I'm afraid  BTW I know of what I speak as a former
owner of a L Auto IROC  and current owner of the
aforementioned car

     Do you think I can use a electric drill change to a suitable
 bit  to turn it out  If I can succeed can I retighten it not too
 tight is it safe without oil leak
 Thank you very much in advance  Winson

Don't worry about leaks  Don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing
Take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out  Now you'll notice after
all the oil pours out that there are no theads where there used to be

Thats why 'heli coils' were invented  Yes buy a few of these gems and
rethread the hole a little larger each time you change the oil
When the hole gets too big for any heli coil you can buy its time to trade in
the car

They light the highways in Texas  Funny everywhere else I've been
they only light 'em at junctions

	And armadillo crossings

Texas is pretty much an edgecase  you can't assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such
wideopen spaces  It just ain't so

	Well let's see in just my own personal experience there's
Nevada New Mexico Texas Wyoming Utah South Dakota Nebraska 
Minnesota Montana Florida and parts of Louisianna

	Nobody said Let's go into town and drive  on Main St
And you couldn't go that fast on the graveled washboard that passes
for highway in some parts  But that only really expensive cars should
be driven fast crap is well crap

 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above  meaning they
would be safe at  Roads like the Autobahn are smoother straiter
wider and slightly banked 

Example A few months back I was traveling late at  night   am or so
and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing It  curved off to the south
east becoming hidden by trees after about  ft and continued to the
left strait north I wanted to turn north checked the south lane rolled
into the crossing and checked the north lane Nevertheless there wasn't 
a car in sight so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane
Now my car isn't a  sec  performer but I was in the corect lane and 
over  in decent time even at  I wasn't wasting time It was then
that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane FAST he 
had just turned the corner and was just noticing me Luckly he saw me and 
changed lanes in time I estamate he was moving in excess of  or so
I was just a by stander I had no chance of runing from him or moving out 
of his way I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time I shudder to 
think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not 
left the time he needed to dodge me

Rule Just because your car can do  and  your way is clear
don't assume it will stay that way

      
      TRAVIS disclamer the ideas expressed above are in fact the same as

Hello
 
I have a  Toyota X and in the last few weeks I have been getting quite
a few dings  in the paint on the hood from rocks and debris off of the
road I have never had any major problems with other cartrucks in the past
maybe a ding once in a while I went to the dealer and he said that it
happens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the
hood He said that the trucks for some unknown reason seem to have this
problem more than some cars 

It seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem
with the paint painted on a monday morning perhaps 
 
How well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks 
 
If anyone has any experiencessuggestions please let me know thanks
 
Greg

I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter I've been
doing it my self over  miles on my current toyota truck I've got
over k I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a
transmission My experiences suggest otherwise What techniques do you use

On some old pieces of junk I drove the transmission was so
worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless
To date I've driven rabbits datsuns comets fords  a chevy Some where
harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother
quicker  easier they where to shift

My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever If for some reason I miss the shift window
I lightly press the accelerator  try agian I've found that clutchless
shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms  I also skip gears some
times using

jmmhVirginiaEDU The Bald Runner writes

I just have got to remind all of you that this is it  Yes
that's right somtime this fall Ford the granddaddy of cars
will be introducing an allnew megacool
waytoofastforAccorddrivers Mustang  It's supposed to be
 streamlined looking similar to the Mach III concept car
Ford came out with around January  I can't wait  Anyone out
there hear anything about it recently

If everything I've read is correct Ford is doing nothing but re
skinning the existing Mustang with MINOR suspension modifications
And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job
of it
The new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a  year old car

gee is it  already
Yes it will still be on the fox program chasis anything that will be differe
nt on the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown The suspension will most
likely be changed as well as the drive drain From what has been printed on
it there is no clear idea of what will be done as some say it will have
the modular V and others the current small block just have to wait and see
Also is far as styling goes from what I seen is good a return to tradition
C scoop on the sides and roof line much like a ' or ' fastback

You know I'm a Ford fan I must say so I'm looking forward to the next
Mustang  I have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable
than the Camaro is now  You know that's MHO  

The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality
just the philosophy  It used to be quality and philosophy  GM is
barely catching up but they have more room for improvement that
can only be made up in time  STSs still come off the assembly line
with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunkdoorhoodpanel alignments
it's those  year old plants  And the latest GM products still come
with the standard equipment RattleDash tm  But like I said they're
getting better and making the move in the right direction

They beat Ford to the market with the CamaroFirebird but really only
in words  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
end of the year keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there  I wouldn't
press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it
Besides no bowtie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway

I do not put much stock in the mag rags' inside information or even
Ford rep quotes  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it's entirety  Inside information had the
Taurus with a V and rearwheel drive at one point  I wouldn't look
for a simple repaneled Mustang folks you may be cheating yourself
if you do  There's a lot of potential  Ford hasn't released a new
car without a wheel IS in  years  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least  right  A wheel IS could happen  Those
modular V's are out there too  In the interest of CAFE and
competition don't rule those out either   Your ignorant if you do
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there
who really knows what it'll look like  The Mach III  Doubt it
Highly

The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car  It attracts
way more attention than the CamaroFirebird because it's heritage
is more embedded in the general public  Don't lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that

I submit that the Mustang will be a success  Enough to elicit
defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here  You know
intelligent critical spews like The Mustang bites man  Some of
you are already beginning  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
will be comparable performers as usual  I predict that the
differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel as usual
The Camaro is still a huge automobile the Mustang will retain its
cabrearward styling and short ponycar wheelbase  The Camaro still
reaches out to the fighter pilot while the Mustang will appeal to
the driver  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set while
the Mustang will continue to sell to the collegedegreed muscle car set
Both will be more refined I do think the Camaro is  There will be
no clear winner

Unless the Ford gets the v hp Romeo  You don't seriously believe
that it was designed for the Mark VIII only do you

Brian

Usually it also equals boxer however I think the term is

This was talked about here in ra many months back I can't remember

Ferrari's TR is a flat  boxer

 As the subject says I am moving from Mass to Calif and will be driving
 mostly on Interstate 
 Any advice from folks who have done it before

 Plan your gas stops in majorcity areas to avoid the  centpergallon
only gas station for  miles and you're an outoftowner surcharge

 Prepare your car  Don't forget things like your fuel  air filters  If
you're loading your car up consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff
just in case of a flat  In my xcountry trip a tire disintegrated in the
California desert  it took me  minutes to unload all my stuff to get to
the tire

 If you have a hatchback cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool as well as possibly avoiding theft

 McDonalds have good clean bathrooms

 invest in a  CB  magnetic roof antenna  It may help if you're stranded
and you can always ask people for places to stop for food etc

 Many times police like to hang out in the st  miles after you enter a
new state to catch all the speeders who have escaped the previous state

 Same as above when you enter a mph city zone after hours and hours of
mph rural interstate

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car  Before
I delve into its innards I thought I'd check netwisdom on the
subject 

It's a  Buick Skyhawk I knowI know
l EFI banger
auto
k miles

When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot especially at
highways speeds the transmission has this nasty habit of
getting stuck in rd gear  As a result when you stop for
a light the motor stalls  Putting the car in park and waiting
for  seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
to reset and go back into st  Otherwise it just stalls when
put in drive  

My thoughts  Either it the rd gear band is binding and getting
stuck when it gets hot not so likely or perhaps the lockup
converter is not disengaging properly seems likely  The least
likely keeping fingers crossed is that some critical vacuum
hose has brokencracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
vaccuum somewhere as used to happen with old modulator valves

My background is that my father owns a service station and
I worked there on and off from  years of age  Please
feel free to be as technical as you want 

I'd appreciate hearing any tipssuggestionsoffers of free

Hi Folks

I recently bought a  Mercury Capri my first car ever
I have noticed a few problems with the car 

	 It gives very low gas mileage something like
            miles  gallon  I hear other car owners speak of
           gasmileage figures like  milesgallon wow etc

	 When I start the car it goes into high idling something
           like  or is it   rpm After driving  or  miles 
           it comes down to  or  rpm 

I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these
problems Or is it natural for an old car like this  it has
done about  miles Someone suggested that I changerebuild
recondition the carburettor I am not prepared to do it
unless I am sure it will fix the problem And yes I got the
car tunedup recently within the last  miles or so

Please let me know if you have any suggestions Please respond
by email since I don't scan this newsgroup regularly

Thanks

Better still years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used

Actually the company and the product was ROVAC  which stood for
ROTary Air Conditioningit used a rotary compressor with what
was effectively an airair heat exchanger and worked pretty well
The negatives were mostly that it was about  less efficient than
using freon and noise problems from the high velocitypressure air
all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt  It
is still a legal entity in Florida but I believe completely dead

 A list of options that would be useful They can be existing
 options on a car or things you'd like to have
 
  Tripmeter great little gadget Lets you keep rough track of
    mileage makes a good second guesser for your gas gauge
 
  Full size spare
 
  Built in mountings and power systems for radar detectors
 
  a fitting that allows you to generate household current with
 the engine running and plug ins in the trunk engine compartment
 and cabin
 
 Feel free to add on

OK

 How about a fuel gauge that really told you how much fuel was
   left  Like can I make it to where the gas is  or should
   I get gouged right here at   Accurate to the tenth of a
   gallon would be great

From natarajartsgmotcom Kumaravel Natarajan

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to clean up
diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter  I'd assume easier
since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses  Let's hear people's opinions

The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with
the newer Ca emissions laws involves three things I know of

 All compliant diesels are turbocharged
 All use an aftercooler which cools the air which was heated
   by compression by the turbocharger up to about  PSI
 A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air
   intake and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is
   low

No scrubbers catalytic converters etc are used  The path from
the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free

Interestingly except for the lowpressure fuel limitation power output 
and mileage are enhanced by these measures  One can buy aftermarket
turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power
and these are approved by the CARB

 It's nice to know that I'm not alone out there when it comes to clutch etc
 problems on late model Hondas  If I get a few more supportive responses
 I will take them to my local Honda dealer or maybe send them to the regional
 rep in Southern Calif for their input on the problem  Maybe some group
 pressure from Honda owners can be placed on Honda to find a solution such
 as a retrofit of the clutch 
 
 Or maybe I'll just sell the blasted vehicle and go back to driving my 
 year old pickup which was now fixed having clutch problems and caused me
 to look for what I thought would be a troublefree solution Ya sure Not
 to put down Honda or anything  the Accord has performed flawlessly in all
 other areas for its  miles
 
 As it is said out of all this something will develop
 
 Later folks

Not alone at all My old  Accord now in the hands of a sibling has a much
better engagement of the clutch Even the old  Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect Note that these are cars with  kms and
 kms respectively My  Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than  wheels most of the time

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day  and after three years and 
kms is no better Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection

 Hi
  I've been seeing all these articles about changing
 brake fluid and I am wondering if this is really necessary
 I have an  Toyota Corolla SR with  and I am in the

Only if you want to stop Seriously though every  years you should
have this done Brake fluid absorbs water over time the water becomes
steam when the fluid gets hot and steam compresses You'll also have
better luck with the longevity of master cylinder calipers and brake

There are two crank configurations for
the flat  the most common one is probably the crank that is very
similar to the I crank

which flat  engines have I style cranks

  Comparing those two engines the I and the
flat  have no first order shaking forces or rocking moments  The
I has a second order shaking force while the flat  has a second
order rocking moment  The significant thing about the flat 's
second order moment is that it can be easily balanced out by adding
mass at the ends of the crank  The I however requires a counter
rotating shaft with mass to balance out the second order forces

i am  sure that subaru and porsche use the boxer configuration
and not the inline  crank that you analyzed and compared would you
care to reevaluate the other case of a flat four  i think that this
configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary secondary
forces and couples are concerned  i have an article in front of me
that says so

Bottom line  the biggest difference between the engines would probably
be their intended use  The flat  is easier to fit under low hoods
and in rear compartments for mid or rear mounting  The I can be
mounted transversely to reduce hood length read cab forward
Other than that there isn't much fanfare to the differences between
them no matter what Subaru ads say  Technology shared with
Porsche  Indeed

the flat four is also shorter than an inline  so even if it is mounted
longitudinally it will not take up lots of length and a longitudinal
placement is easier for a  wheel drive drivetrain

i think that subaru's ads hold water  in practice their flat fours
are noticeably smoother than inline s and completely buzz free
though some may not like its peculiar note  but as alfa has shown a
boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of
recent hondas can approach

Just for the record read your owner's manual before attempting a push start
Most manufacturers today do not recommend this I think the catalytic converter
is the primary reason  unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when
the converter gets into its operating range

The best reason for a manual Because you like to drive one I find that its
much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car Remember pay

Hey all


I'm looking at buying a new car but I'm confused about the insurance
coverage  This also applies to my existing car insurance policy  Does
anyone understand what the Limited Tort Option means  Will it lower
my rates if I opt to have it or will it be more expensive if I opt
to have it  What does it do for me in layman's terms please  Is
it a good deal or should I ignore it  I'm not the type to sue anyone
at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to
the insurance company as a vandalism claim  Please help



Thanks in advance

i am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months  i
am trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can
be in a better negotiating position to purchase a ' right when the
's are coming out  i need something that can comfortably carry
 adults  kids in car seats and  pound dogs  i can probably
afford something in the kk range  i am interested in the SUV's
but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford
i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but
is above my  range  the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range
but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down  can anyone
offer any suggestions  i am hoping for something a little more hip
than the traditional wagon and the SUVs look like fun we do a lot of
camping too

      Don't buy one that is the best way to avoid tickets
      I used to have one and whenever a cop would pull me over see
      the thing give me a ticket  One time my sister was driving
      and had it in the glove compartment it was broken and she
      got a ticket  In  I had received  tickets because of
      it one for my sister so a total of five

      That was five years ago now I don't have one and Have not
      gotten a ticket  My driving habits have not changed
      drastically  Only two days ago I was going  MPH on Highway
      with  MPH limit cop saw me I break a little nothing
      happened I was driving a MiniVan with my family in it
      Otherwise I have Cutlass Supreme  which I do  most of the
      times on the highway

      So basically my opnion is not to get one if you do get pulled
      over The cop will hear your excuse but if you have a radar
      detecter he will NOT again this has been my experienc


Just get a remote model that is not visible to the cop  But be sure to get
front AND rear sensors

You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
doesn't see it right awayValentine is the best detector by far as stated
by Car and Driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from
 It also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through
 the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the
 number of threats the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop
  It's about  and you can only get it factory directone problem

but not even a nice nose  it's one of those very ugly noises 

assuming yours is a non turbo MR the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline  that doesn't have balance shafts  i guess toyota
didn't care about little details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling

myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or
recommendation which has an inline  larger than  liters and no
balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine  

if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do

Eliot is right about  liter engine in the second and last generation
MR's But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR If it's a
first generation car like my ' it has  liter engine or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger if it's ' '
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard
I don't know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply
makes noise Not all that annoying mind you But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear

On the subject of the upcoming new Mustang

I do not put much stock in the mag rags' inside information or even
Ford rep quotes  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it's entirety  Inside information had the
Taurus with a V and rearwheel drive at one point  I wouldn't look
for a simple repaneled Mustang folks you may be cheating yourself
if you do  There's a lot of potential  Ford hasn't released a new
car without a wheel IS in  years  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least  right  A wheel IS could happen  Those
modular V's are out there too  In the interest of CAFE and
competition don't rule those out either   Your ignorant if you do
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there
who really knows what it'll look like  The Mach III  Doubt it
Highly

The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car  It attracts
way more attention than the CamaroFirebird because it's heritage
is more embedded in the general public  Don't lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that


The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
Cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior
After the MN Thunderbird cost and weight debacle Ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in 
a volume car  

The current l V will soldier on for about two years  A version of
the  valve modular V in the Mark VIII could be offered then  Ford
is spending big money tooling up for l and l V engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of  hp V engines a priority 

Undisguised the car looks OK but not nearly as exciting as the new
CamaroFirebird IMO  

I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will 
achieve with the Camaro Firebird  The way GM loses money the temptation
to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off

 I just have got to remind all of you that this is it  Yes
 that's right somtime this fall Ford the granddaddy of cars
 will be introducing an allnew megacool
 waytoofastforAccorddrivers Mustang  It's supposed to be
  streamlined looking similar to the Mach III concept car
 Ford came out with around January  I can't wait  Anyone out
 there hear anything about it recently
 
 
 If everything I've read is correct Ford is doing nothing but re
 skinning the existing Mustang with MINOR suspension modifications
 And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job
 of it  
 
 The new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a  year old car
 
 
 

I just saw a picture of the ' Mustang in Popular Mechanics  what 
a disappointment after being bombarded with pictures of the Mach III

I'm considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
guns by police depts I'm not sure where


Geico has purchased radar guns in several states I know they have done
it here in CT

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had  accident and were immediately dropped  And once
you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk and end up forking out  or  times what you should be for insurance

This must vary from state to state because our old company Kemper wanted
to drop me keeping my wife or tripple our premium because i had  ticket
Only  points for  mph over speed limit  Well i called Geico and they
insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying
Kemper

Generally i hate the whole insurance game I realize that it is necessary
but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense

One good thing about Geico is that everything can be handled over
the phone



My suggestion stay where you are or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico

Much discussion about economics of safety deleted

Safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car I won't buy a 
small car like a Civic or whatever

Great  Safety  Handling  Speed    for me

Seems to me that you would be more dead in a small car than a large car 
after an accident

This is a very simplistic view of safety Assuming that you are in a collision
less likely with a more agile smaller car then the important factor
is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you This is why a thousand
pound F car can hit a wall at  and the driver walks out and why
everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at  as I recall for the last
generation Suburban HIC numbers 

As an aside just what is the point of an airbag It seems to me that
seatbelts with pretensioners Audi et al or a good tight  point belt 
will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag You might be

saved from some flyign glass Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator
safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are
wearing no seat belt

You guys are correct  The Bricklin was produced in Canada
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one and sometimes they put it on display  Most of the time
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it  If anybody's a fan they also have a nice green '
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom

 I am a little confused on all of the models of the  bonnevilles
I have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI Could someone tell me the
differences are far as features or performance I am also curious to
know what the book value is for prefereably the  model And how much
less than book value can you usually get them for In other words how
much are they in demand this time of year I have heard that the midspring
early summer is the best time to buy

Summary Why the repeated leaks
Keywords clutch master cyl problems

I have both an ' and an ' Camry each with manual speed transmissions
The ' has about  miles on it and the ' about  miles  ABout
a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the ' was        
leaking fluid around the piston seal leading to air in the system and fluid
back into the passenger compartment of the car  I pulled the plunger and
got a rebuild kit new plunger seal etc and thought I had the problem
licked  Much to my surprise the same problem developed several months
later  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure
there were no scratches burrs or other obvious causes of the problem  I
didn't find any  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch
hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system  I knew I
would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the
problem

I should add that the clutch is original and that I've had to adjust the
pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in
order to actuate the clutch

My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal
the angle of the piston rod attached to the pedal is off the axix of the
cylinder thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it

What do you think of that as an explanation  Can you suggest a possible fix
short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in

Now the ' same problem except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain
why all of the fluid leaked out by way of the master cylinder into the
passenger compartment while I was on vacation for  days during which
the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort  What
can you suggest here

Many thanks  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this

I took a nonstop trip got shitted on FOUR times every time hitting the

Was going  MPH



I used to have a ' Galaxie convertible was sitting at a light waiting
for it to turn green It turned green but I hesitated a little sleeping I
guess and a bird bombed me it landed directly in front of me at eye
level I guess the bird miscalculated and thought I was going to take off
right away

And I'm still trying to figure out the one I got under my rear bumper as
well  Was the bird flying up and doing fancy acrobatics at my car and
decided to drop one while executing a perfect loop

Having recently purchased a  Probe with clearcoat paint I 
would like to give it a good wax job  What is the Best type of
wax to use for this type of finish  Is paste or liquid better
I would be waxing it by hand and buffing it by hand I guess
using cheesecloth to buff it anything better you would suggest

I've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax
and Raindance not being very good so I'm wondering what is
recommended for a quality finish

Thanks in advance

Jeremy G Mereness zonkerCMUEDU says

Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford Probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

Some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented 
about this problem but I haven't seen it happen on my  month old 
' Probe GT  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since 
the initial batch of cars  Also someone said that Ford has issued a 
service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you 
may be able to get your dealer to fix it

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer where I purchased
the car  the first time they made this problem worse  The second time
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my fordprobe mailing
list they said they didn't know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and
made it much better  However it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough
roads and still squeals when I openclose the window in wet weather anyone
elses's do this

Ford only gives  key with the car  C'mon Ford spend an extra few pennies

I got two keys with my car but only ONE remoteentry pushbutton thingie
But then I bought my  with  miles and  I think it may have been a
repossession  so I'm not surprised something was missing 

horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference

I am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where
it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your Ford
that could  cause  serious injury  threaten lives  etc  Something
about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford  Those little
you'vegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are
TERRIBLE

The latter is probably because of the air bag  It's pretty much takes up
all the space where you'd expect to find the horn
Speaking of the horn I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind
The previous Probes had Japanese horns

Well I guess that's good in a way but in a way it's bad  When someone
hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big American car  They may
not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the Probe is

Tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 
Yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes

The mudflaps help a lot

transmission the  speed is a must

I have always been a speed guy  Almost every car I've ever owned has been
a speed  Because I got a good deal on this car with the  miles I
knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic  But it is a pretty
hightech automatic  It is a fully electronicaly controlled speed with
torque converter lockup  Even with the automatic I'm getting  mpg on the
highway driving     but of course driving   is illegal so I 
probably made that sentence up       Around town the mileage has been
around  not bad for an automatic   Of course it doesn't have the
control of a speed but since I do a lot of city driving it turns out
to be very convenient  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
drive at the same time although that too is illegal here in 
weliketocontrolyourlife Massachusetts 


No shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still

Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe  I've gotten them to fix the
worst of them but I fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will
be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older

Tires VR Goodyear Eagles  left hoping for K 

On my  Probe GL I got about K out of the original Goodyears
and had driven the replacement tires Bridgestone K miles when
I tradeed the car  The VR Firestones on my  Probe
look like they're designed for performance ie rather wide shallow
tread etc so they probably won't last as long  But the car handles
very very very well  It sticks to the road like glue even on a rough
surface

interior is very very nice too  Very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically
sound

Definitely  FordMazda did a very very nice job on this one  The
car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it

Yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone  I personally like it
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car I'd strongly
suggest looking into the MX

Having driven an  Probe for  years I find the  suspension interesting
The car actually drives much better than the   it is a very firm
ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road  Yet
the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads  You Hear and
feel the bumps yet the car retains its posture very well

If you have  passengers by all means bring them along too  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently if that's better is up to you  

Well I wouldn't encourage passengercarrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports writeups consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf  No biggie to me though if it had been I'd not
have bought the car  but it's definitely not a family car

Also there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer

AC is a MUST on any Probe from     The  in particular sends out
a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX  That lots of glass you
mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you
see in all the writeups  Most sportssporty cars don't have that
good visibility

I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine
I haven't heard about this one  I know that some of the very early Probes
' and maybe ' had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which

The complaints I've heard re exhaust system on 's have been on 
the GT  Of course being a different engine that is a differeent 
exhaust system

I was one of those with an  who qualified for the free replacement
Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice 
I wasam due a refund from Ford  I applied in February and am Still
waiting   

gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my
car  I was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering
that I was expecting the worst from them

Yes  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touchup
adjustments this past week and they had to keep it overnight too busy
for them to get to it and they offered to pay for a rental  They 
did make me pay for taxes and insurance though 

From what I've heard it sounds like FordMazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe and probably MX when they first went into production but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  That's
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm  But I seriously
feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well

 Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's  Ford Probe  Every
 once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
 under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  I would guess this usually  
I noticed this is my ' probe also when recently cleaning out the back  I  
think the water is coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the  
spare  Mine looked slightly worn and there was no water or water damage 
I have the same problem with my ' probe  The water is definitely not comming
up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare  I have to remove the
rubber stopper to drain the water  Seems like a common problem with probe

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of  probes
Complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals  It is
a known problem present on most if not all pre Probes so you 
shouldn't have to pay them to fix it  In my case they fixed it on
my extended warranty I just had to pay a  deductable the
work was valued at something like  with labor and parts  Having
removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions I think their estimate
was fair

 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above  meaning they
                                                  
would be safe at  Roads like the Autobahn are smoother straiter
wider and slightly banked 

	Well that's news  Before  the speed limit on Texas highways
was   The speed limit on the New Jersey Turnpike I was   There
were no speed limits in Nevada or Montana

I guess I wasn't clear enough here I said the roads WERE designed for 
speeds of  or so and still be safe The current  will add a saftey
margin

 
Actually the roads were designated as safe at  when they were built
in the 's taking into account the kinds of cars then available The
number would be much higher today because the cars tires and just about
everything else has imprivoved a lot
 
 
I believe the interstates were origionally funded as part of a national 
defense plan etc  The  requirements were to move heavy army trucks at 
mph

Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling  mph and  mph 
on the same  to  lane road  Around Washington DC they can't keep traffic 
flowing at

After too many years of school I'm finally graduating and getting a real
job  Of course I am trying to make plans of how to spend all this extra
money  Right now I have an  accord a good car but not real sporty 
I was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around
k on a sports car of some kind  After thinking about it I may have a
better idea  I'll keep the Accord until it drops and buy the car I've
always wanted  a Corvette Stingray My reasoning is that  accord
 corvette  is less than what I would spend anyway

Basically I'm thinking of a late 's early 's for around k
My question is what are good years to consider for reliability looks
horsepower  in that order believe it or not horsepower is not a main
concern if I want to go fast I get on my motorcycle and what are
good prices

' to ' vettes had the same basic chassis  add aluminum weaker 
rear 'axle' housing  All these years used same brakes similar springs etc
  Late 's was a bad year for GM reliability  Catastrophic converter was 
added in 

Cheapest corvette ' to ' low end about k tops out about k except 
for those morooons that think there ' indy  th aniversity vette is 
special  These guys have been known to ask K  I don't think they get it


Best buy convertables     I got my  for K  needs body work but 
I'm willing  

Parts for all are readily avail at swap meets and mail order etc

V reliability  looks  independant suspension   wheel disk and all 
under K  And they thought a miata was a good deal

Also what would insurance look like  I'm male single  I might
wait until I'm  to get the car  lower insurance Would the fact that
I mainly drive the other car lower it  Is there some type of classic
car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under k miles
per year

    My dad has a  vette and its on what you say 'classic insurance'
    Basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving
    time which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would
    probably suit your needs for limited mileage

My origional inquires to my insurance agent I can drive my ' convertable 
for  miles or less per year I must keep it in a locked garage and it 
will cost me  of the stated value per year does this sound right

 
I've also been looking at vettes recently and found a ' convertible
that I like at a dealer I currently own an ' Ford Escort GT which
is insured through State Farm I called em up and asked about the rates
 
If I sell the escort the vette insurance is  per  months
 
If I keep the escort the vette insurance is  per  months The
escort's insurance goes down by  to approx  per  months
 
I'm  male and have a good driver discount Another variable would
be where you live Best bet is to just call up some insurance brokers
and get a quote
 
State Farm says they base the price on the fair market value of the car
which is determined by an outside apprasier They look in the newspaper
and call up dealers to find out what the going rate is and adjust it for
the condition of the car
 
To get the values above they went on the selling price of the car The
dealer's asking price is  I need to do research to find out if
this is reasonable In any case I told State Farm the value was k

Get an appraiser to look at the car He will check serial numbers and look 
for origional equipe  Depending on what mods have been done the car could 
be worth only K  Problems like wrong engine  trans  Wrong paint type 
vetts used lacquer  An modification would reduce tthe value  But your 
looking for a car to drive right

This sounds like a ball park price for a smallblock  cu in  manual 
 no air car  A  would put it closer to K

Get it appraised  For insurance purposes also

HELP
my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car
We live in South Fla so we are definitely in the right are for one
My wife has mentioned the Miata but I think it is too small
I would like to wait for the new Mustangs  Dec ' I think
Anyone have any opinions on anyall convertibles in a reasonable price range

                                           Thanx

	The Olds Supreme Convertible got high marks in CD's recent test if
you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff  The Saab  ragtop may
be out of your range but its a good choice  Is there a new Fcar convertible
The Nissan SX convertible is a nice car also Those immediately come to 
mind

	Probably the most famous V is the one Cadillac made from about   
to   They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put  
the crimp on luxury cars  It had  cubic inches with over two hundred horse  
power  They don't make them like they used to  
	There were others though  Packard had one until about  whe it down  
sized to their legendary TwinSix their mainstay for the next twenty years   
Lincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure
	Most luxury and semiluxury cars of this era at least experimented with  
V if they did not actually produce them  There was actually a cylinder war  
among the Big Three to see who could produce the biggest engine

Review of  Ford Taurus SHO  By Gene Kim


Background

    Last week I bought a  Ford Taurus SHO moving up from driving
a  Toyota Celica ST and a  Oldsmobile Cutlass  I have been
interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing
the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week  I bought a
remarkably clean maroonred SHO with K miles on it for 
As far as I can tell this is about  under Blue Book and I still
have another  miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out

    As one should with any pre SHOs I made sure that the car was
already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well as
having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments
However my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter  I understand I
can get this for  from any Ford service center  In addition the
car received the full tuneup at K miles receiving new platinum
plugs and valve adjustment

    For a car with K miles on it the car was virtually immaculate
The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents
although the front airdammolding was covered with lots of small
scratches  not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the
highway

    Having driven a smaller twodoor coupe for so long I was a bit
concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car  To
my surprise the size of the car doesn't bother me at all  it seems
just as nimble as my Celica  No comparisons with my Oldsmobile  
Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent helped mostly by of
the small the quarterwindows aft of the backseat door windows and
in front of the Cpillar and rear window  Parallel parking is a bit
more difficult but other than that I love the size

    In fact I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up
for a hour drive to Washington DC for the summer  More on the
ride later in this review


Engine
    
    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs I was very
interested in the valve L Yamaha Shogun engine  I was not
disappointed  Base performance of the engine under  rpms is
good  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear although
I don't make a practice of this  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly
 tooling around town does not require many shifts  This is good
since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car
More on this later

    While the performance of the engine under  rpms may be
unremarkable it undergoes a JekyllHyde transformation once you hit
higher revs  At  rpms a butterfly valve opens and you can
literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve
more valves open up  The engine soars to its  rpm redline and
you are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding V around
The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at  rpm

    I've noticed that when I drive around town I constantly watch the
tach to see how far below  rpm I am  To go from  rpm to 
you may have to punch the accelerator  while torque is more than
adequate it doesn't come fully online until those other  valves
are used


Transmission

    When Car and Driver first reviewed the car in  they
marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter
into the car  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in  and
remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the
car in traffic  the clutch was that stiff  That was back then

    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a
Ford recall in   The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the
one on my Toyota Celica  In fact the friction point seems a bit
larger and more forgiving

    When playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifter
felt very reasonable  The  and  gates were where you'd expect
it to be and the shifting action was smooth  On the road it's
much the same  but you have to shift SLOWLY  Make no mistake it's
a clumsy shifter

    When hurrying shifts like when I was initially trying to impress
friends I consistently miss the  shift often grope clumsily for
the  shift and sometimes even muff the  shift  I find this
pretty amazing in a car like this

    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest
shifts when you take your time  Seems obvious but compared to my
Toyota and my friend's Honda this seems atrocious and clumsy
Someone on recautos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs offtheline
because of the incredibly clumsy shifter

    I now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems more
reasonable  When you play within these bounds the shifter works
smoothly with no surprises  I don't know whether the rod shifter
upgrade would help at all

    Along these same lines I initially had trouble shifting gears
smoothly  Again slowing down the shifts and taking more care to
match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely  This took
several days for me to get the hang of  I think some of my problems
were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad
shifts in higher gears

    Occasionally I have trouble shifting into reverse  The shifter
refuses to enter the gate and I often grind the synchros trying to 
get it into gear  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple
of months

    A quirk  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 
rpm I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the
engine compartment  Not terribly loud but the passenger can
definitely hear it  I asked about it when I was looking at the car
as do all my passengers  Apparently this is a definitely a SHO
sound and is the gearbox  apparently called gear rollover
Replies to my queries on recautos are at the end of this review


Exterior

    As I mentioned before I am astounded by how well the body of this
SHO has stood up  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are
virtually nonexistent  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes
don't age so gracefully I wonder what the guys at Ford did
differently to the SHO bodies

    The body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matching
color body moldings than the stock Tauri  For some odd reason the
SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at
stoplights  of course this could be my overactive imagination
  SHOs get fog lights a more open grille a completely
monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with
SHO stenciled in relief  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have
colored these in with florescent colors or in black  Yuck

    I don't think the car is flashy  I like it that way  I feel
almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there but different and
distinctive enough to those of us who care  


Interior

    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the
car  The seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter are
covered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done in
a blackgreymetallic scheme  

    The instrumentation is stock Taurus except for the  mph speedo
and  rpm tach  You get a center console with two cupholders a
large compartment under the radio great for a CD player an armrest
that contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin
holders for tollways I think and a compartment for holding
cassette tapes  There's mapholders in the doors and an oddly small
glove compartment

    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted
to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a
sink  Hey I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and
thoughtfulness that went into its design  And it's a  before the
interior was upgraded

    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had  Why do they need so
much space    No smartass comments please  

    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters  From
what I hear it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear
Mine is no exception  The left side bolster on the driver's has
cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the
way

    A big surprise for me  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal
hand parking brake  Instead they have the regular parking brake that
you press with your left foot  Too bad  Again I'm getting used to
it but it seems a bit anachronistic to me


Ride

    The suspension is nice and stiff  Too stiff  It's stiffer than
any car I've had  A friend's new  Toyota Celica ST seems tauter
and is still able to soak up bumps better  The SHO seems stiffer with
less ability to soak up bumps  Driving over railroad tracks is a
noisy and jarring affair  On the other hand taking turns feels
wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all  I
listened for that before I bought the car

    On the highway the ride is great  When I drove the car from
Chicago back to Purdue I had trouble keeping under  mph let alone
from trying to see what  mph really feels like  It's a relatively
quiet ride but the sunroof rattles  I've tried to find out what
exactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the window
that rests on the rails  No easy way to get rid of it I think

    Over the past three days I've oscillated between thinking the
suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way
too rough  Not for me mind you  But I wonder whether I would
advise my dad to buy one for himself  But I've discovered as with
the shifter if you take your time with shifts you'll have no reason
to complain  Let me explain

    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the
wheels  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer
making the car skitter left and right  After I understood this I
avoid the limits of traction  and I'm a happy camper again

    It's not body rigidity but the composure of the car

    As if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavy
My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the
wheel at highway speeds  It tracks straight as an arrow but when
driving around a parking lot the higheffort steering didn't seem so
useful  However it's reasonable but it doesn't communicate the road
to the driver as well as a  Ford Probe GT  IMHO it's much better
than the steering on my Celica ST

    I wonder how bad this car is during winter


Miscellaneous notes

    GRIPES

    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent  some days it rattles
        loudly other days I look up wondering where all the noise went

    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy  loud squealing as
	it retracts on its rails  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this
	Again other days it completely disappears  Function of humidity

    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension
	and torque steer I've never complained about ride

    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs  Also I wish the
	side bolsters would close more tightly  

    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive  I
	currently have Goodyear GTs that cost the previous owner 
	for four

    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems  whose idea was it
	to use a volume paddle  Now to my amazement I don't
	really mind  and sometimes think it's an okay idea
	Pretty ridiculous though

    Getting up to  rpm sometimes seems to be a chore  But
	this is no big deal  There is more than enough torque
	down low

    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends  It
	took me a couple of days before I could really shift
	smoothly from nd to rd gear  Hard to believe isn't it

    My car has almost  miles on it  My parents noted that
	it is almost impossible to find a lowmileage SHO 
	Astute observation IMHO  I wonder how long I can make
	my SHO last  I just bought a book titled Drive It Forever
	for tips in this department  

    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop  I once
	parked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch
	after I started it  The car jolted forward and bounced off
	the car in front of me  no paint damage at all but starting the car 
	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal  Also I began 
	to wonder how strong that brake really is  Today I backed out of 
	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed 
	the glowing brake light  Oops

    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way  The same
    	thing happens in my parents  Mercury Sable  Oddly all the
	other windows work smoothly


    LIKES

    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day  The
    	cupholders are great

    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much but
	it really is handy  You can lock all the doors by
	pressing the  and  buttons together  Neat  And
	you can never lock yourself out of the car

    I really feel like I don't deserve this car  I really can't
	believe that I could afford it  I got this car ten years 
	ahead of schedule  

    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to
	look into buying one  I love this car so much that I
	wrote this K file  I meant to write a couple of lines
	and ended up with this  

    If there were a JD Powers Survey for used car owners I would have
	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 
	car  I don't like thinking about getting another car but at this
	point in time I'm sure I'd buy another SHO  For under  you
	can't beat it  Next time with an airbag and ABS though

    Insurancewise this car is also a big win  I pay the same premiums
	as on my  Toyota Celica  despite that it has nearly twice
	the horsepower  



Other Odds and Ends

    Much to my amazement there is no SHO mailing list anywhere
Maybe because the SHO Registry publication has filled this void  I
haven't joined yet but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still
appear on recautos about once a month  Owners of SHOs are always
quick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars  Maybe some
of the most vocal on recautos  

    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars as
well as other posts with useful information on these cars  I'll be 
posting this in the form of a FAQ soon  

    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up
I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one but 
maybe someone out there does

The best autoshifters on the street AND NOT THE TRACK are those from 
Porsche they wont change if you floor the gas during a turn a few 
years back a was in a SX auto you guys call it a SX without turbo
and was going round a corner I floored it and next thing I know I was 
pointing backwards The other drivers seemed quite amused

I just wanted to know

To wheelspin in an auto you keep the gear in N  gas it  then stick the 
gear in D I've never tried this but am sure it works  but does this screw

 Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's  Ford Probe  Every
 once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
 under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  I would guess this usually  
happens
 after a good thunder storm  A few Qs
 
  Is this a common problem
  Where are the drain holes located for the hatch

I noticed this is my ' probe also when recently cleaning out the back  I  
think the water is coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the  
spare  Mine looked slightly worn and there was no water or water damage above  
the level of the spare area 

I have the same problem with my ' probe  The water is definitely not comming
up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare  I have to remove the
rubber stopper to drain the water  Seems like a common problem with probe

   I was recently thumbing through the  LemonAid New

 The current l V will soldier on for about two years  A version
 of the  valve modular V in the Mark VIII could be offered then

How unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which  and
 Fords and  and  Chevys can be built up Still it will provide
a needed punch for the Ford to stay up with the new FirebirdCamaros It
wouldn't surprise me if Ford called the engine a  litre in the
Mustang We all know that the current  is really  litres anyway

 Undisguised the car looks OK but not nearly as exciting as the new
 CamaroFirebird IMO

I must agree I don't think I've seen anything as impressive looking as
the new Firebird since my friend back home sold his  Formula 
Firebird for a paltry  without even telling me The bastard

Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos I'm
not talking about Bronco II's I'm referring to the Broncos that began
production in  based on the F chassis I believe

I need to know what to look for can the tops be removed from all
models how easily can that be done Also what kind of price range
should I be looking at ie what is blue book I'm in college right
now and would like a Jeep Unfortunately I've got a bit of a ride to
school and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in

would be a better read bigger choice than a CJ or CJ

Even better anybody in the MarylandVirginia area interested in selling

I personally like the looks of the Impala SS  The Caprice was definately 
weird looking until this year when they made the rear wheel openings look 
more like a normal car but the Impala impresses me  GM can't exactly shove
the LT in everything they make you know only the bigger stuff  I'd like
to see it next in a  series pickup  That would be a hot setup
                     

What about in a full size Blazer as well  Would this engine have the gobs
of torque necessary for offroading  If so this would be even better than
the Syclone

Well an LT Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed I think its
too heavy  As it is right now the normal HP  engine has plenty of 
power for a full size Blazer  Of course I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the
LT in it   It seems like they have a real winner with that engine  Why
spend so much more money into getting a  valve DOHC V when you can take 
an LT  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG for a  that is


talking about Impala SS
Will this be in the door Caprice body  I'm just curious if Chevy is
trying to resurrect their door muscle cars or to compete with the European
super sedans

Yeah it's a flat black lowered  door Caprice riding on  aluminum rims and
Eagle GSC tires  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ read 
plush police package with  horsepower

I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get 
their  DOHC V and not the LT

While previous Volvos have been essentially very fast tractors the  and  series

Have godlier than thou advertising 

You state this like it is a bad thing    remember car companies use
ad agencies  they don't do their own ads

are part of Renault

Is this true  I know that they had done joint ventures with Renault but I haven't
heard about their subsumption into Renault  does this mean that the French Government
now owns Volvo   anyway Renault makes some very nice cars they just don't sell
'em in N America


However One thing that I do think is in their favour is that they are
immediately recognisable as a VOLVO and that is not something you can say
about most Japanese manufacturers and Ford Saab also have a strong corparate
look which like it or not is what I thing all car makers could aim for to

I am considering the purchse of a  VW Jetta GLI with k miles on it
I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI  v and v
I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same
name  the v version has  more horsepower  wheel discs and a standard
sunroof 
Oops that's the difference between the GLI v and the regular GL 
So in addition to the engine what other differences exist between the
two models of the Jetta GLI 
More importantly how can I tell which version this one is   There are
no badges that said v so I am inclined to think that is the v version
Assuming this one the one I looked at is the v version is there a valid
reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less 
Of course I would love to get the v version but money talks

Please EMail any responses  Thank you

The big disadvantage of automatics is the  HP they consume that never
gets to the wheels  In this respect they are at a disadvantage to a manual

only when the torque converter is not locked up  there are autos out there
with converter lock up in nd rd and th gears

Dont forget that now that new  speed manual trannys are available the drive
train is more optimally geared to get the most out of the engine

rare so are  speed autos but very real

Bottom line is both manuals and automatics have vastly improved

i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals
especially in shift intelligence  i say that a smart automatic is
better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right
gear at the right time which to me is more important than torque
converter losses

I prefer the stick for fun and the auto for traffic

who says you can't have your cake and eat it too  a well designed
shifter will easily facilitate manual clutchless shifts  i am
referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate  the only
department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available
and of course the converter losses

if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission
it can't be half bad

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you can't handle a stick you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick eg
disabled persons but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway 

actually disabled persons have been known to drive in SCCA
races  i'd be careful about making sweeping generalizations here

i'd prefer a manual transmission but the early SHO had an
awful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something
it was almost enough to make me want an automatic

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface
isn't much different to a typical TX freeway They are better
in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

They light the highways in Texas  Funny everywhere else I've been
they only light 'em at junctions

Sorry by they I meant autobahns not US freeways


I won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and
localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
essentially nonexistant

than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at  will kill you at  Don't get me wrong I love to

It would have to be quite severe I don't recall any US freeway
without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe
at  in any decent well damped car

I suspect you have very limited experience  US freeways vary
dramatically particularly between states  I can name a number of
interstate highways in various parts of the country where  would be
very optimistic in any car

Well I've driven in every state but Alaska and drive about k per year
I take long cross country trips any chance I get  its fun for me and I
can get reimbursment
My job allows me to drive rather than fly Not to labor the point but
I've driven just about every freewayin the US Germany UK and France plus
some in Mexico which was surpisingly good


I'm not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations
but I suspect every single bridge junction on I through CT would be
considered so  They're hard to take at mph  That's not the only
interstate I've seen with such deviations but it's one I drive
frequently

Yes but as a age of the total freeway in the US 
All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard advising people to
slow to  or so 


Texas is pretty much an edgecase  you can't assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such

Texas freeways are varied sometimes a good surface Mostly flat But
I in CA is comparable and hilly

wideopen spaces  It just ain't so

Given the absence of other traffic and car built for  eg  
most US freeways are just fine The problem is other road users and
cops

 They beat Ford to the market with the CamaroFirebird but really only
 in words  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
 end of the year keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
 since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there
 
Drivel  I received delivery of my ' Trans Am  weeks after I 
ordered promised  weeks and paid  over dealer invoice 
which is a  discount off of MSRP  I only have about  
miles on it but so far no problems and it seems very well put 
together  By the way first year production will be about  
cars  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage but 
considering they only sold about  F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced midyear that is not going to create a 
shortage  GM planning on ramping to about  F bodies next 
year according to a WSJ article
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the ' Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
 issue p  Direct side on view  Although they described 
it as a seriously handsome car with broad shoulders I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view  Roofline reminded me of a

You guys are correct  The Bricklin was produced in Canada
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one and sometimes they put it on display  Most of the time
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it  If anybody's a fan they also have a nice green '

My suggestion stay where you are or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico

I strongly agree with Jeff  Here's my horror story  Many years back
I switched to Geico from State Farm to save some   I have a relatively
new sports car for which we covered with liability collision and
comprehensive  With this make of car new models came out in January
not September like other makes  The car was purchased in August of
that year

We also had a much older clunker for which we only wanted liability  
Low and behold a vandal slashed the roof of the sports car and we put 
in a claim  This was in October  still the current model year for
the car   A new top with installation was   We had  deductible
so we should have gotten   You had to go to Geico's local office
to have an adjuster see the car unlike State Farm that sent the adjusters
to the shop or your place  He said Since the car is now one year
old we'll depreciate the top by  so you'll get  on the claim
This will also count as an accident against you so your rate may increase

The hassle continued  Then we got a letter from Geico saying Claim
denied  your policy on this car doesn't cover this  I then learned
that their records had the full coverage collision etc on our old
clunker and only had liability for this new car  They mixed up
our cars in their records  I fixed the top myself with some carpet
thread and dropped my claim  They still charged me with an accident
I cancelled my policy and switched to another company

The coup de gras came when they sent me a bill for an additional balance
due for the difference in collisioncomprehensive cost between my sports
car and my clunker  I returned the bill unpaid with a nastygram
plus explicity directions to perform rectocranial insertion
Haven't heard from them since

              Everyone's entitled to MY opinion

Imagination is more important than knowledge  Albert Einstein


	Good for you  I am convinced that someone should start a boycott 
against GEICO  Any takers

 they are pretty much junk stay away from them  they will be replaced next
 year with all new models  


Junk  They've made the CD lists for years due to their excellent handling and  
acceleration  They have been around since about oh  or  so they're not  
the newest on the lot and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class  
leader  You can get into a  L v  hp Shadow for K the I  
turbo a bit more and a droptop for K  


 As an exFleet Mgr of  cars they were amoung the most trouble free of
all models  I bought one for my wife



nnnnnnnng Thank you for playing I cannot agree with this  I believed
this and to put it nicely it was a piece of junk

I loved this car I babied it I pampered it and after  years it just
couldn't stay together I would say that not everyone will have the
problems that I had but know this it's not just the car it is the
ability to get the car fixed which will NOT happen at any
chryslerdodgetake your pick dealer  I don't care if there are going to
reform their dealersservice with the intro of the LH cars I will believe
it when I see it  Case and point the local dodge dealer  You drive up
just looking you don't even get out of your door when about  yes 
salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you
and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards
Service is about  times worse than that  I had an alignment problem but
they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent and about  dollars of
workparts to fix it  Let me tell you the problems I had and I took care
of this car I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took
it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldn't have been

 Dodge Shadow ES

These were replaced within the  years that I owned the car

Engine 
 Alternators
Rear Suspension Torsion Bar
 Water pumps
 thermostats
Hall effect sensor
Main computer
 Batteries

These were rebuiltrepaired

Radiator
Automatic Transmission
Power Steering


Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head  For
about a year before I sold the car I said to myself it's a good car I
just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it  In the end before I
traded it in for a Saturn the power steering started acting up again  I
just stopped putting money into it  I must have put at least 
worth of repairs over it's lifetime  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite
me  Bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are
going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the
hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope

You can do better and I know people will disagree with me here but
Japanese like Honda or Toyota or the only american car company that I
feel is a quality product Saturn  I will not touch another chrysler
product again no way  I don't care how good the LH cars look good and I
will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get  GM
isn't much better thank god they don't control Saturn like they do
their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy  

Don't get me wrong i will be watching my car which I do like like a
hawk for the next  years  I am much more hesitant to say it or any car
is really good until it has proved itself to me

But since someone else pointed out CD as a source  I will note because
I used to read these magazines that Car and Driver has never had a good
thing to say about most Chrysler products Shadow for one always were
they moaning about the reguritated Kcar and engine  Whereas Motor Trend
always thought they were great cars  No car magazine is really objective

And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports I
will use them to reinforce my argument I already know about the big stink
with the Saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the
shadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the
chrysler's rate a better than average I think the best one is just
average  Excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the LH's  You
can find bad stuff about the Shadow  Try as I might when I researched
the Saturn I could not find anything bad about it  There is a great deal
of information about this company just because it is a new american
company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for
good reason  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of
any established company  I read an article which had a subcolumn an I
think this imprinted on me more than anything else  Some big wig in
Toyota said and I quote We are watching them very closely  Come on
everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been
kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make
a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to
set in their ways which is one of the reasons Saturn was created  They
are still struggling because they haven't learned yet  They have the
ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date
but their attitude is and they are just finding this out  It's called
competition gentlemanwomen if you don't satisfy the demand of the
consumer well your out

I looked at that Bimmer yesterday It's an ' has about kmi according
to owner odometer stopped working at Kmi Drivess well sounds good
body is OK he wants 
i liked the car despite it's auto tranny but my wife will be a primary
driver on this one and she wants auto
The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn 
The AC seems to have a leak 
The sunroof is sticky but operational
Odometer does not work as mentioned before
Idle is a bit bouncy going from rpm to rpm
Wipers are slow
That's teh gripes The owner says that he changed radiator alternator 
rotors and calipers exhaust
The biggest problem is that the owner is a shifty SOB telling strange
stories I hate that I would never buy from a persom like that except how
often you see a descent i for that amount of money He also said that
although I could bring a mechanicin he wouldn't let me check the car by taking 
it to a garage Suspicious And who knows what milage is on it
So let me know what to check for given there's practically no rust
I know there was an article on i in RD a few years back anybody remembers
what issue

My  Caprice Classic with K miles has finally reached
the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
I am forced to post   Anyone out there who might be
able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below
please email or post

 When making turns especially when accelerating
   there is usually a loud thunk from the rear of
   of the car  Sounds like it could be the differential
   What could cause this  Is the differential going
   bad  I recently had the differential fluid changed
   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it  And no
   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the
   trunk  

 On starting the car I get blue oil smoke from
   the exhaust for  seconds  Exhaust valves
   going bad  Worn rings  Anyone know whether the
   valves on the  TBI engine can be lapped

 Brakes  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
   with but master cylinder is full and fluid is
   relatively clear  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to
   the floor when held down  Pedal does not feel
   spongey but I suppose that bleeding the brakes
   might help  could anything else cause this

 Tranny  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
   worse  takes almost  seconds to downshift from
   rd to nd on heavy throttle application and more
   recently it is reluctant to shift from nd to rd
   Fluid checked with car running with tranny put
   through all the gears and then back to park as per
   Haynes manual is red and clear and is on full mark

 My springs all around are just about shot  I have
    new shocks on but car still skips out on bumps
   in turns at moderate to high speed  How hard are
   they to change  Can they be reconditioned

I'd be interested in hearing from any GM fullsize RWD owners
out there with stories to tell andor advice  Here in Philly
these cars are apparently stolen quite often and converted
into taxis  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a
junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be
junked  About  of Philly cabs are Caprice's with most of
the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and
Impalas  Broughams

I have a ' Buick Skylark with K on it  I bought it in California and if
it'll let me I'd like to keep it for another year  The only problem is these
Indiana wintersmy heater controls don't work

The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents  Right now it is
stuck in the vent mode  It will blow warm air but I can't switch the air
flow to either the floor I can live without this or the defrost I can't 
live without this  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
defrost position but this blows a lot of air in my face and is well
kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think
the problem or part of it is with the two diaphragms which control updown
and outsideinside air flow  THe diaphragm which controls outsideventin
sideno vent air is cracked most of the way around and the other one is
probably damaged too considering the advanced age of the car

Two questions

	  Is there anything I should be aware of about this other than
	the fact that I should move from Indiana 

	  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available is there
	a way to fix this

THanks for any adviceinfo

 	I just read articals on this in Road and Track and Car and Driver
 	Is that one mag or two B and I was wondering if people out
 	there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to
 	say
 
 
 	I'm looking at the following three SUV's anyone who's driven all
 	three have any strong opinions
 
 
 	Ford Explorer
 	Toyota Runner
 	Nissan Pathfinder
 
 
 	Currently I'm leaning toward the Toyota 'cause I've had big success
 	with Toyota trucks in the past and 'cause I think it's the best
 	looking of the three But I thought I'd see if anyone has any strong 
 	opinions
 
 
 
 			Thanks
 
 
 	Karl
 

I agree that the Toyota is the best looking I just didn't fit plus it is the
highest cost of all the ones you mentioned I have good friends who have all
three of the trucks you talked about the ones with kids all went to the
ford because of the room required to carry a couple of kids and all the junk
you need The single ones went for the Toyota and the Nissan Every one has
been happy with what they bought Although no one is into serious four wheel
off road driving

	Just a quick simple question really

	How many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an ' Nissan
Maxima I've heard that all four are affected but this would seem unusual
to me I thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear
wheels Also how powerful is the emergency brake usually Enough to lock
wheels at mph Hmmmm I just have to wonder about some of the things I
hear

have at least one car  The problem in Korea especially in Seoul is
that there are just so many privatelyowned cars as well as taxis and
buses the rushhour has become a  hour phenomenon and that there is
no place to park  Last time I heard back in January the Kim Administration
wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide
his or her own parking area just like they do in Japan

	Also Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only
car manufacturer in Korea  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and
I believe Kia is back in business as well  Imported cars such as
Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well though they are still
quite expensive

	Finally please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics
and bureaucracy  He's quite uninformed

anyone else experiencing a similar problem

This concerns the clutch on a  Honda Accord  speed When the clutch
is first used in the morning about the first  miles of shifting there
is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up  Then the
clutch shifts smoothly  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
Francisco Bay area from a lowhumidity environment  The dealer stated
that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
nonasbestos clutch material  No remedy Seems that moisture on clutch
surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates

Any comments out there

I would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are how expensive
they are to own and operate parts maintenance gas insurance if the
dealers are good and if they actually live up to their economy image

Another question  what would I expect to pay for a Civic EX coupe with
automatic air and an AMFM radio

Mail to the address below or post to this group

Thanks

Hi there
I've recently been toying with the idea of purchasing an old  The going

My question is this what should I expect at this price Should I expect to
have extensive body work done What about engine  transmission should I
likewise expect to have both virtually replaced Along those lines
does anyone have the names  addresses of any mailorder parts
suppliers for everything from engine to body parts I'm completely new

cars most of the work would have to be professionally done what sould

True  enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this
but I'll dump my impressions  I've wanted to own a  for about  years
now came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead biggest mistake
of my life

Anyway for  you should be able to get a nice car but your also set
in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit
The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the
engine and passenger compartment  Also look for chassis welded together
here  Oh yeah the price range you are talking about must be the  banger
a  if you could find one would be mucho more bucks

Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by for an old car and you
can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too

The machine itself is pretty simple they use the spare tire for windshild
washer instead of a pump fer chris sake so getting it fixed by a good
bugporsche mechanic would be easy  Since it is midengine you may spend
more on labor for any mechanical work

I'm considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident
 
I'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true
Has anyone out there with Geico made a claim  I'd be interested in
hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether
you then had trouble renewing your policy
 
I'm also interested in any good or bad stories about Liberty Mutual or
State Farm
 
Geico supports reads gives to police Laser Radars  They have been known 
to be very picky  No sports cars No radar detectors although Maryland 
insurance board over rules this consistantly No turbos

Basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want 
you  They once told me they wouldn't insure me perfect record because of 
my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance 
 We must insure all the cars  I think this rep didn't know what she was 
talking about

Geico is cheap  But if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped  I 
think in most areas two tickets will do it

Geico will never see a dime from me If I can help it

State Farm  Slighty higher than most but very good response  Not as picky 
as Geico

I'm getting a car in the near future  I've narrow it down to ZX and SC
Which might be a better choice

Having driven both and having owned an SC for  months now all I can
say is it depends  They're both great cars  In fact my wife and I
are saving our pennies so we can get her the ZX convertible in a year
The ZX handles like a dream while the SC rides like a dream
Fit and finish on both are excellent but the Lexus gets the nod in
customer satisfaction  They're both very attractive and hideously
expensive  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX  The
ZX isn't available with traction control which makes it a handful
on slippery surfaces

Actually I've had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage
junk mail in along with whatever else into anybody's prepaid envelopes

heh heh heh

Anyways don't tear up the quotes just yetI sometimes use their

they are lower

As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while

Many cars sold here in Finland are small and cheap cars at least when
compared to other cars  note that we have over   car tax

And you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a  L engine

Most of the bigger cars are however sold with autos

My son is considering the purchase of a  MGB which has been substantially
restored  The odometer has rolled over but we can't be sure of the actual
mileage  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the
restoration except for a new carb and a few hoses  He plans to do vacuum and
compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine  The body
and undercarriage have no visible rust the interior is new as are tires
front brakes not sure about the back battery bumpers and other misc parts
The paint is checked in a few places and scuffed here and there allegedly by
a windblown car cover  It seemed to handle OK except for soft front shocks
Questions

Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out

The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective what should we expect in the way
of braking action

It seemed to be doggy when accelerating from a stop  What should we expect
it to do given the cylinder engine

The top is in place but will not reach a number of the snaps  The weather
was cold  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up or is it forever
shrunk

Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted or are they usually chromed

Given this rather limited description what would be a reasonable price

Gee this turned out to be a little longsorry  While my brother once owned
an XK Jag what a car we're obviously not into sports cars  Any help with
these questions or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be
appreciated

Which Western states have laws that charge sales tax on the difference between
a new car's price and the tradein's value  I know California charges you on 
the full value of the new vehicle regardless of tradein

If you are a California resident is it legal to buy a car in a state other than
California without also paying California sales tax  How does California 
enforce any law that requires you to also pay California sales tax on top of 
the outofstate tax

to the far left of the trunk lid You can only see it if you get up
close to the car and know where to look It is very inconspicuous

In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual
called the car a Nissan Stanza Altima

Anybody know why Nissan did it this way

To avoid paperwork associated with recertification as a brand new car
etc So for ad purposes it's a brand new nameplate for paperwork it's
still a Stanza

As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while 
here in Europe they are rare Just wondering
 

Many cars sold here in Finland are small and cheap cars at least when
compared to other cars  note that we have over   car tax

And you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a  L engine

Most of the bigger cars are however sold with autos



I would guess the high price of gas in Europe compared to the US has
always favoured cylinder manuals

small engines with autos are a real bore

But why not turn the question around why are automatics so common in
the US

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torquerich
V's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress and that this has just lived on

And also an automatic with a V engine can be real fun to drive

I would gladly spend twice the money for insurance rather than using
Geico  Not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want
to make radar detectors illegal  They also ask if you have a detector
probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you

I know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that
was not their fault

  please email or post

AW When making turns especially when accelerating
  there is usually a loud thunk from the rear of
  of the car  Sounds like it could be the differential

Wheel bearing ujoint


AW On starting the car I get blue oil smoke from
  the exhaust for  seconds  Exhaust valves

Bad valve stem seals

AW Brakes  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
  with but master cylinder is full and fluid is

Worn pads rear brakes not adjusted up tight or worn out drums
 of low pedal complaints usually are from a rear brake problem

AW Tranny  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
  worse  takes almost  seconds to downshift from
  rd to nd on heavy throttle application and more
  recently it is reluctant to shift from nd to rd
  Fluid checked with car running with tranny put
  through all the gears and then back to park as per
  Haynes manual is red and clear and is on full mark
Possible modulator valve if equipped with one Also could be the
kickdoen cable

AW My springs all around are just about shot  I have
   new shocks on but car still skips out on bumps
  in turns at moderate to high speed  How hard are
  they to change  Can they be reconditioned
Difficult on front Easy on rear They are not expensive about 
for front and less than  for the rear

Its also kind of dangerous to work on the front springs without the
proper equipment

It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit
to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he
makes a not too sucessful living selling them

Without further delay I will get to the  Audi S


 Servotronic steering

For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is it is the
name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and
used in Audis and BMWs

I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past
couple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of
the Audi  CS quattro and the Audi CS fwd  I am quite happy to
report now that on the S the Servotronic is inoffensive  I
suppose that due to the fat gumball tires the Servotronic has been
loaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation that
I have tried  It is far from perfect mind you and I'd be much
happier if it was an option that I could refuse but on the S I no
longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is
ruined

The steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and I
suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that
some makes it through to the driver's hands  So there is feel and
there is accuracy in the S's steering  But there is also room for
improvement  I consider the S's steering to be better than the
Japanese competition primarily because the Japanese do not believe in
feel and engineer it out completely


 Engine

Wheee What a pressure cooker  With just  miles on the clock I did
not expect the S to be producing anywhere close to what it will be
putting out  miles later but still the car packs a terrific
punch  For a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that it
encourages lazy driving  ie low revs high gear  It is so
supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 
liters of displacement to move this  pound car around in such a
fashion  With maximum torque available at  rpm and a  rpm
redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day which
translates to a speed range of something like  mph  A
chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity Vs
The technical achievement is breadthtaking

Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine In
fact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame Downshifts
are almost unnecessary  It is more fun to use the overboost feature
than to rev the engine  For those not familiar the S engine features
up to  seconds of additional turbo boost for passing  Sort of like
lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with the
right foot only in third gear blast the car from  to  in just a
few moments simply by flooring the gas  As far as the numbers go
maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about  lb
ft incredible for a  liter  It takes a few moments for it to
develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for  Since this is quite
a heavy car one's body parts are not flung around like say the Corrado
VR  The acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to riding
in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff  Also one
is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the
turbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a very
refined but bland sounding  banger

Yes Audi has refined the  to the point where at  rpm it sounds as
serene as it does at   The smoothness is outstanding but not quite
up to the standards of a very good  eg a  valve BMW  I'd say that
in terms of refinement ie willingness to rev smoothness lack of
harshness under full acceleration it is better than many Vs  However
lost in the refinement process is the characteristic  cylinder bark
that made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refined
The  valve turbo  sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under
full boost  Subjectively I'd rate the VW VR engine as being far more
musical than the turbo  Also Audi's own V is also far more musical
with a rorty race car growl when pressed  though none of these can
match its grunt

The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking
off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop  With the extra
inertia from the permanently engaged wd system one has to be somewhat
delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall 
Alternately one could use more revs In both cases a very small price
to pay for such a fantastic engine  I think that Audi of America should
offer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though in
extremely small numbers a  speed for the much peakier V  The
characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic  Ironically
in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the
slush  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again


 Chassis

I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively
modest tire widths  The car comes with Firestones of size  ZR
which is not uncommon at all  However the very attractive  spoke
wheels are no less than  inches wide so there is no sidewall bulge
whatsoever  Combined with the flared wheel arches the S has a mouth
watering macho yet subdued look 

On rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new  body
style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as
road noise suppression I suppose the two are interrelated but I
digress  To use a cliche the S's body feels like it has been carved
out of stone  Flex is totally undetectable even when going over rough
roads  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers
do not cause excessive harshness and while the S's ride quality will
never worry a Lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or
pony cars

The servotronic steering has already been mentioned  I consider it to
be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering  I  was
able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation I
think a new concept is at work in this car  With its fat gumball tires
talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless  On a
banked highway on ramp I went in slow and started applying power as I
went around  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the
skin on my face was being tugged sideways  Yet the car was totally and
completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs It felt that the
limits were not even close to being approached  The g forces were
thrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely
uninvolving  You tell the car what you want and it does it  End of
story  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those
reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical
efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car

The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty
well too though I've read that they are prone to fade  I am not too
surprised since the S does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi
 fwd Harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a more
wooden response when cold  I am starting to see a trend among the
luxurysports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by
additional braking capacity  The LS's fade performance is nothing to
brag about neither is the Q's or the Legend's  Brake fade these days
seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on
antilock capability


 Comfort

For a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are also
excellent  The cabin is beautifully appointed with carbonfiber panel
inserts in place of the wood trim of the ' S  All the expected
gizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power this
and that  The glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removed
because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet That means that the
car has no boost gauge  A real disappointment taking into account how
much the turbo dominates its performance  

Unusual for the germans the S comes with a Honda style moonroof as
well as the very intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switch

Noise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't
consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough
to sway a potential buyer


 Conclusion

Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S at its sticker price
of K the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to
offer over the competition  The  valve turbo  is a real gem even if
it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds  No other luxurysports sedan maker
offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some is
worth the extra money all by itself  The safety features are also 
top notch  side impact standard compliant the very elegant 
automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags  The  series
Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests  It gets my
thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being
all out exciting and intoxicating

My suggestion look at your current insurance card there will be a name 
accross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by
Call information in Houston and get the number of a branch office in the 
Houston area call the insurance company

Your rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want
do you want to carry comp and collision probably not on an 
what your driving record is  You mentioned none of these things in your
posting so how can anyone give you accurate information

Like I said pick up the phone and make a few calls it won't kill you

There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
will come back on after  weeks The tool is in fact illegal in Europe 
atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know 
of no other tool anyone else 

About changing oil every  miles thats ok on newer Audis they 
only require it after every  miles I am talking about an oil change
Just a query do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully Like no sudden 
acceleration etc If yeah then the  M oil change seems quite reasonable
But if you drive kinda fast I'd get a bit up tight abot that  thingy

a point to note just because the first light came on at k doesn't mean
all the others will come on every k too

Just a quick note on the nwe shape MRs in the UK 

When they first came out here there were  models The base model had an 
auto box and engine from the CAMRY   Well I recentyl found out that this 
model is no longer profitable for Toyota and have since scraped it I've also
noticed that auto MRs have depreciated a lot more than the next model up

Surprise surprise huh Oh you lucky Americans have the turbo MR 
No such luck over here

     I used to drive a truck a few years back I once rode with an old codger
that had been driving for about  yrs The only time he would use the clutch
was to get the truck moving He could shift that  speed lightning quick up
or down without the slightest rake of a gear He was as smooth as silk It was
the most amazing shifting demonstration I've ever seen Having said all that I 
still don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a
clutch Why do it

freon  plus tax   Second what can I do about this if this is unfair 

 Albert Wu

For the information of those not lucky enough to live in the city of
Austin TX if an auto ac system is checked and found to have leaks
it must be repaired at that time or evacuated  This is an ordinance
unique I think to the city of Austin

Freon is subject to increasing taxes but  is about X cost here
Recovered freon is not required to be purchased from the car it is
withdrawn from  As a matter of practice some shops here are charging 
a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it 
is reintroduced to the system

    Anyone else had the same problem 

       Well I have an ' Taurus GL  Apparently they still haven't fixed the
   problem with the rotors  I've got K miles on the clock and I'm getting
   the rotors and pads replaces tonightat my expense of course

I owned a Ford Mustang  that had endless brake problems  The bad
thing was that it had all other kinds of problems too  Spent  months
in the shop in the first  years I owned it bought new   So I got
rid of it and will more than likely not buy a Ford product in the
future  The thing that really ticked me off was how Ford treated me
They were such jerks it was unbelievable

 Joe


In the past few years I have owned  Mustang GTs and now own a  TBird SC 
They all have had this problem There was a recall on the Tbird for the brake 
problem The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp 
after about K miles Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on 
the TBird I'll never buy a Ford again

As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US  
while here in Europe they are rare Just wondering
 

Many cars sold here in Finland are small and cheap cars at least when
compared to other cars  note that we have over   car tax
And you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a  L engine
Most of the bigger cars are however sold with autos

Here in Australia most cars are manual privately owned anyway  Why
Not sure I think it has something to do with the fact that our car industry
in the past was more closely aligned with Europe than the US in the past
Now it's aligned with Asia

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my  Prelude See recautostech for more detail My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one It also seems affected by weather 
it is most noticeable and annoying on damp or cold days My dealer says
he can't reproduce the problem  I think I'll just sell the car

In my opinion the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever
done Basically limited tort means that you give up your right to sue
for pain and suffering unless one of the following conditions is met
 Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed X where X is
some number like   I'm not sure of the exact number

 The accident was caused by a drunk driver I mean the OTHER driver
was drunk

 You get a good lawyer and have a good case basically you can appeal
to regain your right to sue but there's almost no chance of this ever
happening

You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering you can
still sue for medical costs actual damages etc By agreeing to limited
tort you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who
treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery In
exchange you get a substantial reduction in your rates I save
year

Unfortunately the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse
people so much that only about  of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort
I guess that's OK  If more people opted for it the insurance
companies would be pushing harder for repeal

The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm
Bricklin who I believe was Canadian  He was the first one to import
Subarus and later was responsible for importing Yugos I believe 
Anyway he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports
car but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features  The
Bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts the safety sports car
 If any of you remember the early s movement among car makers to
design experimental safety cars you will recognize the general
appearance of the Bricklin  big 'ol bumpers etc  Anyone recall other
safety features  The engine was an american v Ford I think is right

Personally I kinda like the way they look and if I remember from the
old magazine articles the performance was only halfbad  The choice of
colors though tended towards the s lime green  yech  but highly
visible I suppose  

The Delorean on the other hand was a dog  nice looking IMO but no
motor at all

The clutch on my ' Honda Civic EXV EX in the US does this too
It's annoying  Now that I think about it is worse when the humidity is
high  The dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is 
a selfadjusting hydraulic design  Yeah right

Carrying a pistol loaded or unloaded in the glove compartment is
considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without
a concealed weapons permit  Unless the law has been changed recently
carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal
I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a
traffic infraction and observed a  magnum revolver sitting on the
seat  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon
because it was not concealed  The article stated that if the gun had
been discovered in the glove box it would have been considered a crime

A dealer will make money off you in three ways if you let him

	  New car markup over his cost remember his holdback
	  Arranging financing through the dealership and
	  Screwing you on the trade

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating     Buying a car at 
dealer's cost is meaningless if he makes  on the trade andor gets a 
kickback from the bank

Blue book you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average 
retail is a good guide to value for a car  If you are selling it yourself 
try to get average retail and chances are you'll have done ok

Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends

It just happened to me and I payed A LOT to get my

A marten choose my car to stay one night in and this
damn little animal damaged almost everything which
was plasticrubber 
I never thought that these little  could do that
much damage

So to ALL you car owners out there 

Is there a GOOD known method of gettin' rid of  this animal 
except for waiting all night long beneath my car with a gun 

HELP IN ANY FORM WOULD BE APPRECIATED VERY VERY MUCH

From article Aprsequentcom by troysequentcom Troy Wecker
 
 Earlier I commented on the Valentine and jimfcenterlinecom replied
 about the value of the units bogey counter  I didn't really go into
 why I called this feature a gimmick so here is more explanation  Thanks
 Jim for the good comments and opinion
  
  
  

 From what I understand the Valentine can only tell if these
 microwaves are coming from the front rear or both  There are only
 two antennas  If they are coming from both this in interpreted as a
 side bogey  Bogey counts are determined as sources by their
 relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the
 same source
  
  
  

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not
actually using the Valentine  I'd like to give some feedback based on
real life experince  I keep the Valentine in advanced logic mode
and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree  The only time it does
is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes
sense that is does since there are   sources coming from many different
directions  I have found the Valentine to be consistent in its
reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area

I have found the directional indication to be very useful  In one case
there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other  As I
passed the first radar trap the direction indication changed  Then
the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction  With
other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection
But with the Valentine I knew there was a high probability that there
was another trap  And there was

On other occasions the directional helped discern a false alarm from
a true alarm  For example as I pass a source the direction indicator
changes  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where
the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the 
place  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector
that leaks I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the
car passes me I can verify the source  With other detectors I would
have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar
trap when there was none

I've had the Valentine for several months now and find its added features
to be useful and not gimmicks

Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling  mph and 
mph  on the same  to  lane road  Around Washington DC they can't
keep traffic  flowing at 

Germans are just more organised you can't blitz all of Europe in a
matter of  what  months unless you're pretty organised If we tried
that there'd just be a whole bunch of tanks backed up at the border
waiting for some jerk in the right lane trying to get over to make a
left turn

This of course caused Germany to invade Belgium One of the important
lessons of history is that anything including late afternoon
thundershowers will cause Germany to invade Belgium

Hi
I need your help with a problem I have with a  Mitsubishi
Galant GS transmission  The car has a  speed manual tranmission
Since the car was bought new while shifting from nd to rd  unless 
I do it SLOWLY and carefully it makes a popping or hitting sound
The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service reached by an   say 
this is NORMAL for the car  IS IT
And about a year ago at Kmiles the stick shift handle got STUCK
while attempting to put it in reverse
    The shifter would not budge  The clutch had no effect
    The front tires would not budge even when the clutch is
      fully depressed
    If the clutch is released the engine would die
    Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was
      stuck I could not make the car move  It acted as if
      it were in Neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released
    I finally was able to release the shifter by having 
      someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch
      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter
    The shifter acted normally after that

When this happened I took it to the dealer they checked the 
clutch it was ok They checked the transmission it was ok

I had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again last
week  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because 
Mitsubishi the   says they have never heard of the
problem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while
they had the car  
In all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garage
and since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towed
to the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarily
solving the problem  And the dealer and Mitsubishi refused to
send someone to check the car while it was stuck 
I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting 
from nd to rd and getting stuck at random but I can't get 
the dealer to fix it I need your help with the mechanical problems 
and with how to handle Mitsubishi  
All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated and sorry to
bore you with the long post

Thanks
Rabih

If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster which
gauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set

Turbo boost is necessary if a turboed car
Fuel reserve warning
Coolant level warning

It would also be nice to have a gauge that would cycle across the different
sensors in the FI system such as O sensor altitude Air Flow

I'd love to get Tranny and diff
Brake temp would be great

Talking about car alarms there are certain cars in this country that are 
only insurable if they are fitted with a Vecta alarm We're talking Coswoths
and Porsches and stuff Just before they the insurance companies decided to 
make this move they insisted that the car be fitted with a Scorpion alarm 
now they've changed to the Vecta so everyone who's spent  on fitting 
the Scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the Vecta system

I dont know about Saabs but whenever there is a 'long temr tset' in a magazine
they always say that tehy're are little annoying niggles which keep on occuring
every so often I wouldn't expect that from such a 'quality' car why 
doesn't anything like this ever happen on BMWs Maybe coz they're 'quality'
cars

I got a price quote of  for a Camry V wABS from a Toyota dealer in 
Eatontown I came back to that dealer in two weeks to sign a purchase agreement
Then I was told that the salesperson made an error in pricing I walked out of 
that dealer I wonder if this kind of practice is common with Toyota dealers 
Is the price quote written on the salesperson's business card binding
I would appricate any comments


I had a similar experience  We had a written quote which had been mailed
to us from the salesman at one of these nohaggle Toyota dealers for
a Camry XLE wABS leather etc  The price seemed fair but when we
went in to take them up on their offer they discovered that certain
extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote
It would have totaled an extra  and in spite of the fact that we
had a written quote they said there was nothing they could do

Bottom line quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that
the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they
don't have to deal  We walked went out and bought a new LH car
Eagle Vision TSI and I don't regret it one bit

 I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
 Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX
 
 But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  I'd assume easier
 since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  Let's hear people's opinions

This really bugs me  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle
but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars
in California  What a bunch of crap  Diesel is the fuel of choice for 
enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason

The particulates are nothing but carbon  They are just an annoyance at worst
Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions torque or engine
durability  It's also cheaper

Just to clear things up as to why I posted the question that way
I was debating with a coworker about diesels  I claimed they were
cleanerburning than gas engines  He said the extra junk put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses   I made all the SAME claims
you did  But one question of his was what about the carbon  I said it
was harmless but he wanted to know how to get rid of it  I suggested
scrubbers  I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than cats  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber  I'd like
to know just to answer his final question  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise

BTW I named my subject Dirty Diesels because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd
read it

I'm looking for information on Opel cars  Now you ask which model
Well the sad truth is I'm not entirely sure but it's a twoseater
with rollover headlights hard top and really sporty looking  My
friend has one sitting in his yard in really nice condition
bodywise but he transmission has seized up on him so it hasn't run
for a while  Does anyone have any info on these cars  The engine
compartment looks really tight to work on but it is in fine shape and
I am quite interested in it

That would be the Opel GT sold in this country from ' to '  It originally
had a  cc engine which was later replaced by the  cc  It was based
on the old Kadett drive train and suspension with leaf springs in the rear
and a single transverse leaf spring in the front  It looked good but was
limited as a performer

There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other
models  In  Opel introduced a new line of models the  series that
were also known as model numbers   etc  These cars had the newer
cc engine and were available as two and fourdoor coupes a station wagon
and a sport coupe known in Europe as the Manta  At the same time there
were two series cars which sold very few numbers that also had the 
engine but the Kadett suspension  The sport coupe model  was also
available as the Rallye R with a blacked out hood tach and fog lights
but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio

In  the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US   was the last
year for the GT in any country both because of the US bumper height regulations
and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing
to build the GTs

The  series continued in  with minor body differences  In  the
Manta  sedan also called the Ascona and the wagon were available with
Bosch electronic fuel injection  These cars also had larger brakes and
wider wheels  These cars were starting to compete with the  Buick Century
low price leader of the time and were the last Opels imported into the US

From  to  cars that sported BuickOpel badges were still sold by
the Buick dealers but were rebadged Isuzu Imarks  The idea was to call them
Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs

Various models of the series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the
's in their class and were known as serious competition

Parts are still available from a number of sources

I still have a ' manta and two ' sedans and all the trick parts I could
collect in  years

An aquaintence has a  Accord  The driver's side headrest was
accidentally put in backwards and has jammed  According to the
dealer the only way to get it out is to spend several hours
disassembling the seat  This is the second time I have heard of this
happening and I wonder whether there's an easier way to get the

Your advice would be appreciated

new  series Mercedes Benz wagon
Particularly I would like to hear about power manual t only
Any comparisons between the Saab  line and the Mercedes would be helpful

If a manual transmission is a must have then the MB TE is not in
the running  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North
America  It seems that buyers here or maybe more accurately the
distributors are not interested in manual trannies

The '  line comes with a  hp engine  All earlier years are  hp
I have an ' E with a mere  hp and auto tranny and I find that
it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation  More is always
nice but I can't complain

I test drove a Saab  CSE last fall  Here are my impressions

 Awesome power especially over rpm when the turbo really comes on
 If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner the frontwheel
   drive causes it to understeer heavily and then viciously hook into
   the corner  Not a desirable handling trait but common in powerful
   front drive cars  The CSE is hp  Mercedes is reardrive so it
   does not have this problem
 Huge interior and cargo space
 The most rubbery shifter I have ever encountered  I drove a spd  It
   was absolutely numb  You might be able to get used to it  I don't know
   I also didn't like its location which was too far down and too far right
   From the shifter's position I got the impression that Saab really designed
   the car for an automatic
 It was rather noisy  Engine buzz rattles and creaks  Mercedes does
   not exhibit these characteristics

You should also check out the new BMW  touring  This is a wagon version
of the i  It fits into the class with the TE and Saabs

Mail bounced so

In article Aprnewsengconvexcom you write
i am in the process of buying a new auto  i haven't decided yet whether
i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new
auto purchase

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it 
yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle  Having a tradein on a purchase
just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing

i know that the blue book value for the car is 

I assume this is retail bluebook  There are two bluebook prices one for
retail and one for wholesale  You really want the retail price if you can 
get it  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage
and extras on your particular car  You should look all this stuff up yourself
Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country
that may not apply in your area  For example blue book prices are low for
California  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is
to call around and see what it's selling for if any used lots have one or
looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices  It 
might be more time efficient to take a small loss rather than hold out for
 months for the best price

an acquaintence
has offered to give me blue book value for the car

I don't know what you mean by an acquaintance but I would make darn sure
that I was paid that is cashier's check in full before delivery  There's
a real temptation when selling to a pseudofriend to be more accomodating
than you should  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying
in full at the start with a cashier's check or cash then I would go
elsewhere  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot
or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook  That's probably a safer approach
than selling to a private party

 I'm considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
 they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was

 also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident
 
 I'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true
 Has anyone out there with Geico made a claim  I'd be interested in
 hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether
 you then had trouble renewing your policy
 
 I'm also interested in any good or bad stories about Liberty Mutual or
 State Farm


 Stay away from GEICO

 A recent CAR  DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free
 laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit
 enforcement  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket
 your premium will increase dramatically based on how much over the
 limit you were  If I remember correctly at more than  over
 you'll get something like a  increase 

 If you have a radar detector you will be denied coverage or dropped
 immediately 

 One accident claim and you will be dropped
 After many years with GEICO my father who had  tickets and had made
  claims had an accident and filed an  claim  He was dropped 
 immediately  Since then he has been with State Farm for years with
 no complaints

 I have been with State Farm for about  years  no complaints

    I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since
I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since 
The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and
fuel consumption When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater
than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed
autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance
Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion the engine must make up for that
by burning more fuel Anyway since the geometery of an auto is rather
complex the Dragpressure coeffiecentetc is either found experimentaly or
using a numerical method

anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is

            Cd  dqR

       where d is the drag force q the flow velocity and R is the radius
of the clyinder
   To get a rough very rough estimate you can set R at  the car's
width q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd find the drag force that
the car would need to overcome

GKOccasionally I have trouble shifting into reverse  The shifter
GKrefuses to enter the gate and I often grind the synchros trying to
GKget it into gear  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple
GKof months

Enter st wait  seconds and then go into reverse  They use the same
synchros and you'll never at least I haven't groundemtofit when using

GKI hear that tires for this car can get really expensive  I
GKcurrently have Goodyear GTs that cost the previous owner 
GKfor four

Try Eagle GAs wear better cost less lose little handling and are
quieter  I'm going to switch to s in my next set with new rims
Fitti Twists if I can afford 'em by the time my GAs wear out

GKis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal  Also I began
GKto wonder how strong that brake really is  Today I backed out of
GKparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed
GKthe glowing brake light  Oops

Mine is strong enough to not let the car move when it's in even if you're
giving it enough gas to normally move it in st  You might need a brake
adjustment

GKThe driver's power window creaks when closed all the way  The same
GKthing happens in my parents  Mercury Sable  Oddly all the
GKother windows work smoothly

Watch it closely the glass actually flexes from the torque in the motor it
seems stronger in the drivers window then the others

GKI'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day  The
GKcupholders are great

I've found the location under the armrest in between the seats to be a
pain but like having them  They moved it into the dash pop out in the
' model year MUCH better

GKI really feel like I don't deserve this car  I really can't
GKbelieve that I could afford it  I got this car ten years
GKahead of schedule  

I did the same thing  Got a black ' with k miles on it for k
in July '

GKI've put together the responses to my questions about the cars as
GKwell as other posts with useful information on these cars  I'll be
GKposting this in the form of a FAQ soon

Grabbed it and archived it  Thanks

GKIf anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up
GKI don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one but
GKmaybe someone out there does

I'll be starting one this summer one way or the other current software
I use dosen't support mailing lists but is on the RSN list  if not I'm
going to upgrade to another package that DOES have it that is if nobody
else beats me to it  Will make an announcement here when it goes up

 Based on my experience with a ' FJ  the hardtop jeepstyle model  I 
 would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market The
 older models are VERY well built Unless Toyota lost its mind I would
 assume until  proven otherwise that the newer models have inherited some
 if not all of the qualities of their ancestors
 
 Two major differences in the running gear that I'm aware of need study
 My ' has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
 independant front suspension The solid axle is theoretically stronger and


The new Cruisers DO NOT have independent suspension in the front  They
still
run a straight axle but with coils  The Runner is the one with
independent
front  The Cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system 

 more reliable than the newer model but only experience will tell The
 independant front suspension is no doubt a compromise made to satisfy
 the typical user who will never need a real utility vehicle The second
 difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models I'm
 not sure but I think Tioyota went to a fulltime WD or allwheel drive
 system The older Landcruisers have a lockup type Both have their
 advantages and disadvantages
 
The up Cruiser does have full time WD but the center diff locks in
low range  My brother has a  and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which
has done all the  trails in Moab without a tow  The  and later is even
better with the bigger engine and locking diffs

Summary Considering buying



	Having had my car die on meengine fire insurance agent said
it was probably totaled I am in the market for a another vehicle
I saw a Toronado that was within my expected price range and was
wondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me

Namely    Does it have accceptable powerit has a  in it
	   Does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult
	   One power window and the power seat do not work are these
		expensive items to replace if I do the work myself
	   How long do the engines usually last M now
	   Any other experiences good or bad and opinions

Thanks

 anyone else experiencing a similar problem
 
 This concerns the clutch on a  Honda Accord  speed When the clutch
 is first used in the morning about the first  miles of shifting there
 is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up  Then the
 clutch shifts smoothly  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
 Francisco Bay area from a lowhumidity environment  The dealer stated
 that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
 nonasbestos clutch material  No remedy Seems that moisture on clutch
 surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates
 
 Any comments out there

The clutch on my ' Honda Civic EXV EX in the US does this too
It's annoying  Now that I think about it is worse when the humidity is
high  The dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is 
a selfadjusting hydraulic design  Yeah right


One of the reasons I sold my ' Civic VX was the chatterygrabby clutch
although I din't notice it being any worse in humid weather perhaps because
its always humid around here  I was told by Honda that it has to do with
changing from asbestos to nonasbestos linings which began around 
Someone could make some good money selling the oldfashion variety if it's
legal to manufacture them these days  My feeling is that since many other
car makers do not have this problem that it's a poor design or engineering
problem on the part of Honda  Three things to look out for on all Honda
products  clutch chatter bad brake rotors and rusty exhaust systems

V  must be one somewhere

Believe Bugatti's cominghas out  one  Something like  turbos
and mucho macho HP  One cool price too as i heard  At any rate
the point is i'm pretty sure there is indeed one in production
tho rather limited

This is NO Bugatti  It's labeled a Bugatti but has nothing to do with 
the Bugatti's of yore from what I understand  Just some ppl wanting to
build a silly supercar and use that name to sell it

Drew may be thinking of the Cizeta Morodor vt but that hasn't reached
production at least not yet  As for the Bugatti well I have to agree
with Matt it ain't the top dog it ain't sexy and sveltlooking and it
ain't a real Bugatti  In fact it looks like it's in tight competition
with the Consulier for the most buttugly car of the decade award

It isn't that bad  At least the Bugatti EB has compound curves compared
to the slab sides on the Consulier  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V
thing of it as  three cylinder turbo engines tied together  Also Ettore
Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the
development  So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in
today's world  Much like Enzo Ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to
take over part of Ferrari as well 

I don't know of any cars with v but there are a number of motorcycles
with them  but I couldn't tell you which ones all motorcycles look alike
to me   D

That's funny  I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about cages' 


Most GP cc motorcycles are Vs and the VF line of Hondas were all Vs
from the VFF through the VFF including the RC race bike and
the present VFRF  It should be noted that Lancia built a V in
recent history in the Fulvia HF a very pretty Italian coupe

 I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than

 But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  I'd assume easier
 since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  Let's hear people's opinions
 

VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps  Also VW
uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well although I don't know the
mechanics of it

Many diesel carsbusses and trucks in Europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway

It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions

In a previous article gwmsplsplloralcom Gary W Mahan says

Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients ie Cd mentioned in magazines  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
what does this mean in the real world  Is there a way to calculate new top speedsassuming the car is not rev limited at top speed or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from  to 

It's pretty complex and Cd isn't the whole story either  Cd for cars is
usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car  So a large car
with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
poorer Cd 

To calculate drag use this formula

D    rho  v  Cd  S

Where D is the drag force lbs rho is the local air density slugsft
V is the velocity fts and S is the frontal area ft  Note that the
pieces called   rho  v are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
a fancy aero term for air pressure or force 

Note that power is

P  F  v

Where P is power lbffts F is the force drag in this case lbf and v
is velocity fts 

Note that if you put the whole equation into one by substituting D for
force you get a velocity cubed term  That's why huge increases in power
result in little increases in speed  Ditto for decreases in Cd 

So if you have a  mph car and reduce Cd from  to  your new top
speed is  sound of trumpet fanfare

 mph

Sorry to dissappoint

The whire wheels aren't chromed they were to be painted silvergrey

The accelerating from a stop shouldn't be doggy because of the light
weight of the car

Don't pull the topto make it reach the snaps I pulled a couple out of
the top doing that  Replacing the spanps usually doesn't work  Let it
sit in th e sun open on the car for a couple hours the try  GENTLY

I continually blew up the  connecting rod bearing be sure your not
buring too much oil

Don't expect too much of a smooth ride  The lever arm shocks hold the
road and your bladder  The are ultraexpensive  Supposedly the can be
rebuilt  J C Whitney sell a shock replacement kit the uses standard
shocks

I had to rebuid boththe brake and clutch master cylinder in addition to
the clutch slave  This work made a world of changes

Be sure the carb is the original type replacement  My  had dual
Stomberg oil dampenned side draft carbs

Ask if the clutch has ever been replaced  To replace the engine and
tranny have to be pulled as a unit

If you need more I had mine all through hiogh school  Lots of
maintenance to use every day

 There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
 will come back on after  weeks The tool is in fact illegal in Europe 
 atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
 used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know 
 of no other tool anyone else 
 
 About changing oil every  miles thats ok on newer Audis they 
 only require it after every  miles I am talking about an oil change
 Just a query do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully Like no sudden 
 acceleration etc If yeah then the  M oil change seems quite reasonable
 But if you drive kinda fast I'd get a bit up tight abot that  thingy
 
 a point to note just because the first light came on at k doesn't mean
 all the others will come on every k too
 
 							Shaz

Hmm but the service indicators that I have works this way
  There are  green yellow  red indicators
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car The computer will actually sense how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off
  
  After service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again

So I expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at  miles is a 
surprise to me and it's a big plus  But I wonder how that could happen
since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time I thought it's the oil and
not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil

Any BMW owner on the net Response welcomed

PS  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW

I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be  I believe that automatics
should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise
would not be able to drive  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy
More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery
instead of concentrating on the road  The manual transmission keeps the drive
always doing something granted it isn't a large movement  Plus driving should
be FUN  Driving a manual is fun driving an automatic is a chore
	In the case of shift speed automatics can be made to shift far faster
that any human could move a stick  If I was racing I'd want and automatic  For
normal driving go with the manual

	Now if I remember correctly the Camry costs about  or so more
in initial costs  Essentially it means that you spend about  extra

needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things
I would much rather spend  more in initial costs than spend  more

 You know I'm a Ford fan I must say so I'm looking forward to the next
 Mustang  I have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable
 than the Camaro is now  You know that's MHO  
 
 Truethats your opinion
 
 They beat Ford to the market with the CamaroFirebird but really only
 in words  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
 end of the year keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
 since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there  I wouldn't
 press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it
 Besides no bowtie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway
 
 True again I wouldn't take a free Mustanghonest
 
 The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car  It attracts
 way more attention than the CamaroFirebird because it's heritage
 is more embedded in the general public  Don't lie to yourself and
 believe Ford will forfeit that
 
 FYI they already did
 Too bad that the current Mustang can't even compete with the new
 Camaro without using an active imagination
 Right now few cars can compare with the ' Camaro Think about it
  for a car that will out perform all but a few exotics
 If you are now swearing at me look at the statsthey don't lie
  There are NO comparable cars in it's class certinaly not for its price
 
   You knowintelligent critical spews like The Mustang bites man  
 Some of you are already beginning  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
 will be comparable performers as usual
 
 I also agree This subject is one that will never be setteled
 Except maybe at the  track 
 
 Unless the Ford gets the v hp Romeo  You don't seriously believe
 that it was designed for the Mark VIII only do you
 
 Hey can you imagine the potential of a MODIFIED LT
 Folks in a few years we will surpass the levels of performance 
 achieved in the late ''s thats scary

You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid

Like they say in the airforce with enough horsepower anything will fly

I can put a valve V with twin Garrets on Yugo and get sec QM
Thats useless  Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track
or on the street

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultralongthrow stick shifts of
the  with the  MR turbo or  RX I ll buy it in  mos 

Or the Torsen differential of the RX compared to the Differential of 
the  that sounds in every hairpin turn 

And bythe way  and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks

 Hi
  I've been seeing all these articles about changing
 brake fluid and I am wondering if this is really necessary
 I have an  Toyota Corolla SR with  and I am in the
 process of doing preventative maintenance and I was
 wondering if this was something that I should add to

 Any information would be greatly appreciated I really
 love this car and would like to keep it for as long as 
 possible
 
 Thanx

Amplifying on Jeff Goss's answer the absorbed water will rust your

 I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
 Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX
 
 But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  I'd assume easier
 since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  Let's hear people's opinions
 
 
VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps  Also VW
uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well although I don't know the
mechanics of it
 
Many diesel carsbusses and trucks in Europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway
 
It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions
 
erik

   I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars trucks and busses but I think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants or at the wrong time or both

   I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars  They stink  And it's always
 rollupthewindows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when I am driving with my family

   I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines and that's why they stink  So the 
 invisible unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels  Yeah
 well so what  Someone forgot about the visible stinky kind and
 as far as I am concerned those kind are just as bad

    I am all for destinking the diesel vehicles  It'll keep the
 traffic signs cleaner too

 Hello auto enthusiasts
 
 I recently had more car mangled broken into and decided to
 get an alarm installed  It's a Viper  and has a shock
 sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic
 door locks

I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone  It works great  The shock
sensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor I have
on my other car  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind
but any kind of shock sets it off  Even kicking the tire sets it off  It
works great

 
 What worries me is the hood and hatch  If someone could pry 
 them up gently enough then they could bypass the alarm

The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it  You can adjust
it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without
setting off the alarm  Although I know that you cannot pop the hood on the
Syclone without setting off my alarm now and yet I have had zero none false
alarms with this system  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has
been activated in your absence  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's
cause and it was not a false alarm
 
 I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl
 underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm
 
I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle  My Syclone is so tight
in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this  There are
supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm but I don't
have one  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarm
won't keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply

 Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that
 supposedly detects people approcahing the car
 
This is primarily for convertibles  I have a convertible and have looked at
this feature in detail  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want
to get one of these  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so
that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that
would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighter
I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you
leave the top down on

Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package  It talks to
people as they walk by  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit  The kids would
taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back 
The owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind
 
 I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems
 and about the viper in general
 
I am real happy with my Viper  One other feature I really like is you can tune
it to your preferences  You can have it arm passively or not  You can disable
the chirp for armingdisarming  You can have it lockunlock the doors when the
alarm is armeddisarmed  

I like these features  I hate the chirp when the alarm armsdisarms so mine
flashes the lights only  I like the door lock feature although I have to be
careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your
keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors  But if you are
meticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the rest
 The car is an  Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape
 
 
 Ron Garnett
 

I looked seriously at the Alpine system too  It is a real nice system but
more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor 
The shock sensor is betterand the Viper shock sensor is better  cycle
than the optional Alpine one IMHO  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good
value for the money  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof  No system is 
Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only 
Anyone know where we can get one of those installed  Maybe that was what they
had in the van in the World Trade Center huh

Before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm
let's go on the assumption that one is desired  The question then remains
which one  I've owned a Hornet and was satisfied but not enough to get
another for my new car  The Alpine has been highly recommended but what about
Clifford and VSE's Derringer   Any others  I want all of the standard stuff
door lock interface starter kill light flash LED valet mode passiveactive
shockmotion sensor etc  Thanks for the advice

  I am curious about knowing which commericial cars today
have v engines

V  I don't know of any
Because there is no such thing

A friend had a Ford Taunus era early 's that did have a V in it

I lost a bet on it I find it hard to believe there are no recent cars
with a V in them Any recent ones

As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while 
here in Europe they are rare Just wondering

Primarily milage  Gas is much more expensive so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer  This
along with narrow old cities also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic  So having engines that don't work well with
autos and a great concern for milage the usual Eurocar has a
manual

Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals  If you've got the
money for the car you've got the money for the gas and the engine to
drive through the slushbox

As automatics become more efficient the bigotry is probably
reduced  Still everyone knows how to drive a manual and cars are
cheaper with one and it saves a little expensive fuel  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic

In the EC the Corrado VR is rated as 'best handling car this side of a 
' As it goes I just read an article in 'Autocar  Motor' comparing the 
VR to a Ford Probe later to be launched in the UK The VR is more powerful even more so coz its  instead of  in the EC and more fun to drive
etc etc but the Probe has a slightly smoother engine thanx Mazda MX

They sum it up as 'both cars are fast  the VR is a bit more exhilirating to 
drive but only if you're prepared to work harder'

Edu  US     are both com and edu US 
fr   France
dk    denmark
no    Norway

com and edu are both United States one refers to commercial institutions
the other to mental  I mean educational  institutions  gov is also
pretty much US it refers to government institutions  Internet was built on
the AARP backbone a US Defense contractor network that used the extension

I think you mean ARPA AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons
and I seriously doubt that they'd want young whippersnappers building
anything on their backbones what with decalcification and all 

to identify the type of organisation  Internet extended the convention for
other countries but the US retained the old conventions

The general convention is that if it doesn't have a country tag on it it's
a US site That includes
	com	commercial 
	edu	educational 
	mil	US Military sites 
	gov	US Gov't nonmilitary sites eg NASA sites
	org	anyone who is none of the above
There are sites with such tags that are nonUS sites but they will have
the country extension eg xxxxeduau is an extension I saw today
US sites can also use the us extension but as Mr Smith pointed 
out the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone and they default
to US sites if there's no country code

I would suggest that anyone who didn't know this or wants to know
more about it on a nonsystemadministrative level check out
the book TheWholeInternetUser'sGuideandCatalog by Ed Krol
or is it Catalog and User's Guide I can never remember and my copy
is my desk at home It's a very good notnecessarilytechnical
guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it including
USENET I don't think it's part of the Nutshell series but it is
published by O'Reilly and Associates

This should go to one of the news newsgroups but damned if I
can figure out which one

hi
would someone like to post a comparative analysis quantitative
measures hp etc and more so the qualitative feel of how they compare
for the driving feel handling noise responsiveness etc for the
saab 's and the bmw  series
any comments on just comparing the  with the  re handling 
i take it that the saabs and bmw's are comparable for reliability and
all thatwould be nice if flaming wars could be avoided and
folks just post their experiences 

I had a ' Saab  Turbo and now have a ' BMW is

There is no comparison for handling reliability or overall quality of
engineering The BMW wins hands down After  years I was sick and tired
of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB The year
old BMW is still as sweet as it was new

But I see you are posting from western MA BMW's SUCK in the snow
I have aggressive snows plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back and I
still try to avoid driving in the snow I happily took the SAAB through
blizzard conditions without a worry I would say this is the single design
flaw in the BMW

Ashtrays and cigarette lighters  These should be an option

You forget that the cigarette lighter plug is essential for plugging in radar
detectors and lights The ashtrays are also essential because they are great
places to keep change and tokens

Wouldn't you rather have some type of standard electrical plug instead of 
that fire hazard waiting to happen adaptor I know I would and I would 
also prefer to have sensibly placed cup holders instead of an ashtray my 
car came with coin holders already built in

 I have a pair of sport seats from ' MR for sale blueblack

As the owner of an MR and having several friends who own them
I am very uncomfortable when I see an ad like this  I have known
several people who have lost the seats from their MR in the middle
of the night to support the Celica retrofit trade  and the 
insurance companies have been very miserable to deal with
in all cases  

When these seats are seen for sale they are most often stolen
So it would be nice to see a statement saying where they came from
That would at least help to soothe the reflexive fear that someone
is making a buck at someone elses expense

I'll give this seller the benefit of the doubt but people should be
aware the the vast majority of MR seats on the marketespecially
those that are in Celicasare stolen


Lee

 BTW  They are incredible seats  So if it's legit go for it 



I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement 
I see a lot of computers advertized on the net and my friend just had been
releived of his machine  all the netcomputer ads are for stolen computers
Where did you learn logic

As for the seats they were replaced by a much harder literally Celica GTS
seats due to my back problem That is why I had to reuse the MR brackets
and that's why the MR seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets

Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above
It hurts

A GT  Gotta be in my top  favoritecarsofalltime
list  Where is this place  Was the car for sale  COME ON I
need detailsor not  Anyways I just had to say WOW at the
sighting of such a fine beast  But remember the Mustang will
forever be the true King of the Road  

The place was in what used to be a small town now a suburb north of 
Atlanta I don't know if the car was for sale or not you wouldn't put
a price on the window on this type of car anyway 

Damn straight As far as I've heard unless the owner is very
hard up the GTs are not for sale at any price that mere
mortals could afford

And maybe the Mustang
will be forever King of the Road the GT isn't road legal

I think the GT actually is street legal although that particular
question is moot see the price figures below

This car was right hand drive weren't they all like that How much does
a GT go for How many were made

I wish I could find my ShelbyAmerican guide it included the GT
registry as of ' or so There were precious few of them made 
fifty is the number that springs to mind they made just enough
to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup or whichever series it
was that Shelby broke Ferarri's year winning streak in in '
and they are all accounted for The last price I saw estimated on a
GT was a little bit over  yes that's right ONE MILLION
US DOLLARS it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari
that it would blow the doors off of 

I don't recall offhand what the drive configuration was although
I'm certain some must have been LHD as they had to be sold to qualify
for racing The drivertrain was the Ford  hiriser I think 
andor sideoiler coupled to various speed transmissions They
also used speed manuals they had lots of problems with the
original trannys breaking under the load of the  Layout was
rearengine reardrive with the bundle of snakes exhaust
headersI can remeber other bits and pieces of info but I
can't remember whether they applied to the GT or the Shelby

if this is ridiculous kindly explain why it's been more than  years
since i studied this stuff  

Flat s and Is both have the potential to be nearly vibration
free  Because Subaru does that has nothing to do with Is in
general or Porsche

I think Subaru somehow connecting themselves to Porsche is an
absurdity and I'm not a Porsche fan  Big wing dings  These
configurations overhead cams etc etc etc have been around
for nearly  years 

the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles
for the orthodox inline  they are using a horizontally opposed 
which is unique in that market segment  and porsche also uses a flat
six in their  so what's the problem  i don't see any claim that
their engine is as good as a porsche's they are simply pointing out
that they use the same configuration as a porsche if you want to
nitpick ad campaigns i think there are far more blatant excesses than
this

         Call around to some wrecking yards in your area andif they have

 Dick Grady           Salem NH  USA            gradyworldstdcom
 So many newsgroups so little time


I bought a brand new  Chevrolet K HD x extended cab last
May  It has had many many problems  See my earler post that describes
the situation  I went to BBB arbitration and they ruled that Chevrolet
must buy it back from me  If you do get one stay away from the  speed
manual with the deep low first gear  They have put three of them in my
truck so far  After about  miles overdrive either starts
rattling or hissing loudly  There is no way to fix them  Chevrolet 
says that the noise is a characteristic of the transmission

Also if you are planning to use your truck to tow the
gear ratios in that tranny suck  On a steep hill you get up to about
 MPH in second gear at  RPM yellow line  If you shift to third
the RPM drop to only  and you begin to loose speed  I should
point out that the  V they put in the HD  GVW trucks is a
detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones  They
dropped the compression ratio supposedly for engine longevity
reasons  So the light duty  may pull better than my truck does
Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan  times 
so far paint had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being
shipped by rail with no covering and suspension parts link between
stabilizer and control arm fell off

Any company can make a bad individual car Chevrolet included  What
really bothered me was the way they reacted  They made no attempt
to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for 
them to attempt to fix it one more time  So I bought a brand new
Ford F HD Super Cab with a  and an automatic  I will never
buy another Chevrolet

A question for any highmileage Audi owners out there I am
interested in buying a  Audi S for  Cdn  The
reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
 km on it just under  mi  The car's owner
claims the car is in good condition  My question is how
reliable are Audi s with mileage that high  Would it
be worthwhile for me to buy the car  Any problem areas that
I should look out for

Any help would be greatly appreciated  Post responses andor

buy one of these instead of a Corvette and save about 

I like the idea of an Impala SS but if they really wanted to impress

My car was recently destroyed in a hail storm  
I fully expected to get jerked around by the insurance company
I wasn't the only one who had hail damage  State Farm
opened its claim centers on evenings and weekends and flew down
additional adjusters from Dallas

i have no experience with State Farm but i think it's important to
differentiate your experience from a typical accident

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner and also tends to
be well publicized in the media so it's to the ins co's benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully  damage like this doesn't imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms so there's no reason
for them to stop covering you
that's a lot different from atfault accidents or theftrelated claims
which may be more indicative of claim patterns

Subject Re Warped brake discs on ' Taurus L

   In the past few years I have owned  Mustang GTs and now own a  TBird
   SC  They all have had this problem There was a recall on the Tbird for
   the brake problem The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the
   rotors warp after about K miles Between this problem and the fit and
   finish problems on the TBird I'll never buy a Ford again

       I just had my rotors on my ' Taurus GL changed less than  miles
   ago andyou guessed it I'm noticing slight warpage in the left rotor
     I had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a
   high spot on the rotor that is causing the problem  This is a brand new
   rotor bought from a Ford Dealership  Can't they even produce a brand new
   rotor that is not warped  I'm currently negotiating with them to swap it
   out for a new rotor

       This is my first American build car and I'm not overly impressed

On the subject of the VFord in the UK used V engines exstensively in
their Ford Transit vansThis brings back a memory from the seventiesI
played in a band at the time and for something like  pounds four of
us bought a  tranny to cart the gear around inIt was in terrible
shape cosmetically because it's last owner was a pig farmerWe spent
days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til
the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried
pig shit came flying out the vents
    Back to the engine if I remember right it was a cc V and that
thing could haulwe could fill it with equipment and up to  people and
it went like a bat out of hellof course there were no pollution controls
on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now
    When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a 
Morris Minor that worked great Ah fond memories

As the owner of an MR and having several friends who own them
I am very uncomfortable when I see an ad like this 
   
When these seats are seen for sale they are most often stolen
So it would be nice to see a statement saying where they came from
   
I'll give this seller the benefit of the doubt but people should be
           
aware the the vast majority of MR seats on the marketespecially
those that are in Celicasare stolen

I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster 
 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement 
Me thinks thee dost protest too much   
 
Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above

He made no allegations and specifically gave the seller the benefit of the
doubt  He simply made the net aware of the fact that many of these seats are
stolen so watch out and ask questions when buying  That's good advice to
follow when buying anything from a third party on the net or elsewhere
It hurts

  There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
  will come back on after  weeks The tool is in fact illegal in Europe 
  atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
  used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know 
  of no other tool anyone else 
  
 Shaz
 
 Hmm but the service indicators that I have works this way
   There are  green yellow  red indicators
   initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
   your car The computer will actually sense how you drive your car and
   as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
   then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
   on And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off
   
   After service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the
   computer starts counting again
 
 So I expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will 
 come on and the yellow and red lights will go off
 
 I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
 indicator
 
 It's the first european car I have and changing oil at  miles is a 
 surprise to me and it's a big plus  But I wonder how that could happen
 since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time I thought it's the oil and
 not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil
 
 Any BMW owner on the net Response welcomed
 
 PS  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW
 
 Derek 

There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights
It will cost you  from a mailorder and buying one far outweighs
the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
di it yourself 
You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset
Why is reseting so important The only reason for doing
it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you 
Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every
' crap Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape and
extending its life will change it every  inc filter Don't wait
for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car 
I bought a bmw about  months ago it had  green lights on I have changed
the oil every  completly flushed brake fliud changed all filtersoil
air and fuel changed transmission and drive oils
and done almost all of the other things req for service 
and a service  After nearly  miles I am still on  green lights
After a winter in Burlington and it is snowing today that is not bad

Good luck

QUESTION what's your experience with car wash wax

This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in
water sponge it on you car hose it off and dry it with cloth
Many people have used it It is very easy to work with and gives
seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax

But does it last long Does it have any negative effects to car
paint

Can you forward your reply directly to my email id Thanks

James

Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos I'm
not talking about Bronco II's I'm referring to the Broncos that began
production in  based on the F chassis I believe

	Ahh Broncos  Well personally I have a '  The blue book is just
a hair over  grand  I bought it for  and then bought new tires 
front end rebuild  carb rebuild   Then i did the unthinkable
and blew the engine not bronco specific unmaintained engine with 
 more bucks there now it is in nice condition well after new seats out
of a tbird radio  amps speakers alarm well the radio and amps were 
free and i bought the speakers used for  bucks and the other speakers
i took out of my old jeep Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask
but it was a Wagoneer  Its a lovely specimen solid front and rear
axels ford  and a dana  up front  Watch the rear axel wrap i 
busted off my ubolts ONCE i added traction shocks after that and 
haven't had a problem since  Also the bottom of the doors tend to 
rot bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones
that might be in your budget  The post  broncos have that sickly
TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were
as the  have nice big cast iron longer radius armsie more prspective
wheel travel  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few
dings in the sheet metal  I don't know when the removeable tops were
discontinued but they are fun  I just ordered a full convertable top
for  for minecredit card  Don't ever break the window if you
have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over
 bucks to replace  My bronco also does pretty good offroad
i haven't bottomed out my suspension YET and have crossed over
 foot deep of water with no problems handles rocks like a charm too
One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a
Toyota between two rocks or trees and your grandmother will have
a hard time getting up into it

BTW I just saw the new Q on TV this weekend  The big changes a
GRILLE has been added looks nice too and some WOOD for the
interior  Otherwise it looked largely unchanged 

They changed the lights and slope of the hood along with the new
grille  Otherwise it is unchanged

Interestingly their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG
design statement they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve
their own niche  unfortunately sales were only half those of the
LEXUS and hence they now join the pack  I still wonder if much of
the problem wasn't the slow start from the initial AD campaign

Personally I like the Q without the Grille

I'm not familiar with the trannies used in Winston Cup but in the transam
cars I've played with the  transmissions were the racing variety with
dog clutches instead of sychros  In a transmission with dog clutches the
gears are always  engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches
engages the gears to the shafts  Motorcycle transmissions are the same way
Shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause
transmission damage the only question being how long it  takesto grenade
something for the trans in my   Pulsar SE it was  about k miles but
it had a weak  tranny in the first place

just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro
transmission  What you described SOUNDS the same to me  In fact what little
i've studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs
and said they were synonymous  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting Or at least
that is what i was taught  Explain por favour

 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem
 Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
 fluid  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight  Some of the
 cars I have had all standard transmissions  or  speeds recommend
 changing the transmission fluid at  miles under normal driving
 conditions  I've gone  without changing the transmission oil and
 had to replace the transmission bearings My older cars used  weight
 oil whereas my  Honda uses  motor oil or maybe  weight

I agree with Jeff's reply  I've never changed the brake fluid except when
having a brake job which is usually at around  miles alot of
freeway driving  However I will start to do this as preventative
maintenance on my new car  Also there are brake system flushing agents
that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the
system it can cause problems so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless
you are  certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent  Just for
your info I was quoted a price of labor and fluid for
flushing the brake system this in conjunction with a break job so I don't
know if it was more without the brake job This is in the SF Bay Area

Hi Javier how are things at Corp my old stomping ground was clevel
Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused on disc brakes at least
by warped rotors When the brakes are applied there results uneven pressure
on the rotor  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem
as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning ie within spec
There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop
should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free

Didn't the Saab Sonnett have a V I recall someone telling that it was

Not only the Sonett correct spelling but the  wagon and  sedan
used a  cc or  cc V from Ford of Germany  This particular
motor had a  degree vee angle a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
ports  This motor was later stretched into the V commonly seen in the
Capri

The V could make pretty reasonable power for its size  But in the
Saab it made too much torque for the transmission which had been
designed for a cylinder stroke

	Class act This is a really really nice vehical Very comfortable
	handled ok Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE But it's huge
	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk also the manual shift is 
	weird and kind of awkward I'd buy this if it were k cheaper or 
	shorter But at this size and for this price no I kept picturing trying to 
	park in in San Francisco No Thanks


Chevy Blazer

	Cheap looking Small Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan but still 
	too small

Ford Explorer

	This is no sports car and it's certainly not for the serious off roader
	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving though it would
	be nice if it had a bit more The automatic tranny is pretty nice head and

before you go in Find out the invoice prices of the car add a reasonable  
profit for the dealer  offer them that price and stick to  
it

Whoa  Watch your terminology  Dealer invoice is not dealer cost
You'll hear lots of ads screaming two dollars over dealer invoice
Sounds like a real deal huh  No  You know what the dealer invoice
also called factory invoice is  It's a piece of paper with numbers
on it that the factory sends the dealer  What do the numbers
signify  Absolutely nothing  It's a marketing gimmick that the
salesman can wave in your face to impress you  Note that nowhere
on the invoice does it claim to be the real price of the car and
most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast
low voice saying something like invoice may not reflect actual
dealer cost  Actually I guarantee it does not reflect actual
dealer cost

Also the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent
Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that
you want  Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of
dealer prep and protection package ie a few squirts of
paint and fabric protectant  While you're at it ask the salesman
to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash  My 
wife and I got a joyride in a twinturbo Mitsubishi GT when
we bought our Mitsubishi minivan

Okay okay I know the Ford Probe is made in the US in fact it's
made in Michigan at a Mazda plant  My question are most of the parts
from American or Japanese sources  I have been told that most of the US
assembly plants for Japanese automakers import almost all of the parts used in
the vehicles

Any information anyone has on this will be appreciated

 Hi netters
 
 I went to All Tune and Lube for routine maintenance
 and they said I need to change plug wires because
 they are original ones and you driven  K miles on them
 I had a strong suspicion that they just wanted to make money
 Wires had no visible defects and my repair manual doesn't
 recommend any scheduled maintenance for them
 
 Is it plain vanilla rip off 
 Or there can be some backing behind 
 their suggestion to replace wires
 
 I have Ford Taurus

Jeremy G Mereness zonkerCMUEDU says

Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford Probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

I've found mine ' Probe GT to do quite well  

window problem deleted artical has been trimmed

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer where I purchased
the car  the first time they made this problem worse  The second time
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my fordprobe mailing
list they said they didn't know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and
made it much better  However it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough
roads and still squeals when I openclose the window in wet weather anyone
elses's do this

I've not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but
do get the squeal that Bill describes  I live in Seattle so the wet weather
may be a factor

Ford only gives  key with the car  C'mon Ford spend an extra few pennies

If I recall correctly I got two keys

horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in 
center personal preference

you'vegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are
TERRIBLE

This is true  I'm wondering if this may be a safety concern  IE if people
pound on the place where the airbag lives

Speaking of the horn I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind
The previous Probes had Japanese horns

No opinion

transmission the  speed is a must

I have always been a speed guy  Almost every car I've ever owned has been
a speed  Because I got a good deal on this car with the  miles I
knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic  But it is a pretty
hightech automatic  It is a fully electronicaly controlled speed with

The  speed is much more fun  We opted for the automatic for a number of
reasons but it's still fun and in some ways more practical

No shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still

Ditto

Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe  I've gotten them to fix the
worst of them but I fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will
be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older

I too would suspect that this may be true

Tires VR Goodyear Eagles  left hoping for K 

very very very well  It sticks to the road like glue even on a rough
surface

Yes

interior is very very nice too  Very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically
sound

Definitely  FordMazda did a very very nice job on this one  The
car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it

Ditto

Yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone  I personally like it
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car I'd strongly
suggest looking into the MX

Agree Check it out  I don't mind it but would say that if it was much 
stiffer it might be a problem  How about the ' R RX for suspension 

Well I wouldn't encourage passengercarrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports writeups consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf  No biggie to me though if it had been I'd not
have bought the car  but it's definitely not a family car

True  

I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine

I haven't heard about this one  I know that some of the very early Probes
' and maybe ' had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which

I've had this problem and read about it  or at least I assume the one
I had was the one I read about   In any case what happened was the
weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it ok so I'm not a mechanic
broke  In my case the dealer welded it ordered replacement parts and
put them on when they got them  I suspect this is some sort of  design
flaw or  production flaw  In any case I have an earlier model and would
expect it to be worked out on newer ones  In any case it is a warrantee
repair  or they get the keys back

From what I've heard it sounds like FordMazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe and probably MX when they first went into production but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  That's
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm  But I seriously
feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well

I second this  There seems to be some things that slipped through but the
car seems very sound  While not perfection what is you get an awful
lot for your money

One more way which works in manual trans cars I've driven and it is my
personal favorite the other suggestions above are great but try this
one too  

While pushing the shifter gently towards reverse let the clutch out
slowly right to the friction point and the shifter will be pulled into
position If you do it right the car won't jump backward nor will the
gears grind You will just glide back

 Hello auto enthusiasts

 Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that
 supposedly detects people approcahing the car
 

This is primarily for convertibles  I have a convertible and have looked at
this feature in detail  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want
to get one of these  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so
that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that
would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighter
I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you
leave the top down on

Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package  It talks to
people as they walk by  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit  The kids would
taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back 
The owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind

	My neighbor runs a ViperR distributorship and installs them on all
Saturns sold in my area Anne Arundel County MD  He has an SC with the
Viper voice alarm installed  The alarm does everything turn on the car 
the radio the heater roll down windows unlock the doors  The alarm goes
off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by  It gets sensitive up
to about  feet in degree heat  It isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms
because it doesn't continue to wail it just says Protected by Viper please
stand back  And shuts up  mainly because the person walks away

Let me explain why I feel the bogey counter feature is a gimmick
Radar waves bounce off objects especially metal  That is how radar
speed measurement works  A high frequency microwave X band approx 
GHz and K is approx  GHz is sent out and reflected back to the
antenna off of an automobile or other objects  If an object is moving
a Doppler shift about  Hz per MPH on X Band occurs is measured
and converted to miles per hour  These waves bounce all over the
place and they can reflect many times and go in many directions

From what I understand the Valentine can only tell if these
microwaves are coming from the front rear or both  There are only
two antennas  If they are coming from both this in interpreted as a
side bogey  Bogey counts are determined as sources by their
relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the
same source

I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis
on which to make this argument but don't you answer your own
question  Is the reflected signal shifted at all from the
act of being reflected  If so wouldn't it then be easy for
the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct
sources

Here is the problem  Since the microwaves reflect how does the unit
tell if it is a source or a reflection  Take a Valentine and
drive to the local grocery store that uses an XBand radar door
opener  You can tell by the small black box above the door pointed
down at about a  degree angle and your detector going off when it
gets near  The Valentine will count  or  bogeys from all
directions front rear and sides it doesn't say which side  The
count changes as cars drive by and reflections change  Is there  or
 sources  Not at the store I go to  As I drive around with a
standard detector I can only find one source and that is the door
opener for the front door

Each Valentine  is hand tuned to maximum performance is all the radar bands
of coverage this of course adds to the labor cost and in turn the cost of the
unit

I live in the backyard of the folks who make the Stalker radar system The
Valentine  has saved me many many many times from the stealth revenue
enhancement traps of the local area I have had all the major brand detectors
and IMHO nothing else even comes close to the V

I don't work for Valentine I am just a satisfied user of their unit

If you really want the nitty gritty details on all this call the nice folks
at Valentine Research They will be more than happy to explain their 
perspective on radar detection and analysis methods 
The calls free

It seems that there are more and more bands available for
police radar each month  I have recently purchased within
the last  months the BEL STW  While it is not a perfect
detector by any means it does do the job fairly well  

Now however I pick up a car magazine at the airport and
read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of
the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors
was touted as covering  

So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all
the usual bands X K Ka photo Ka wideband as well as the
new Super Ka wideband  

Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing
increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs for
the average home consumer at least it seems that there is
now the same concern with radar detectors  Does it make sense
to upgrade just  months after purchasing my new detector
Is Valentine upgrading their equipment  If so it might be 
worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine  I was in the 
market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the
 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had
inadequate protection with my Passport  Life was much simpler
when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best
equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously
shop for a new detector  I hope that the flood of new radar 
bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business

Hello again

Anyone here done any tinting work  What are the best brands out there
How about applicationsI heard there was a water based brand that s
you can move around till it's just right and you then let it dry like that

Also I would consider having it professionally done how much around
Wisconsin or Chcago area that does a decent job fairly cheap college kid

Thanks for all the info

Ps  What is the maximum legal tint limit

sighting of such a fine beast  But remember the Mustang will

Especially the ' ShelbyAmerican GTKR King of the Road so named

And maybe the Mustang
will be forever King of the Road the GT isn't road legal

I think the GT actually is street legal although that particular
question is moot see the price figures below

Some GTs are street legal some aren't

This car was right hand drive weren't they all like that How much does
a GT go for How many were made

I found my ShelbyAmerican guide There were a grand total  GTs
built
		GT Coupes		
		GT Road Cars		
		GT Mk II		
		GT Mk IIIs		 
		GT Roadsters		 
		Mirages			 
		GT Mk IVs		
		   	TOTAL	       
		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	

Twelve of these cars were prototypes  racing coupes  road coupes
eight Mk II coupes  LHD Mk IIIs and  RHD Mk IIIs The other 
breakdowns follow the above list eg  were Mk IVs The LHDRHD
breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs

The prices for those which can be bought are around the  Million
mark last I heard with a projection of some  Million or
thereabouts in  It was second only to some pennyante Ferarri 

Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in ' that
was also the year that he retired them from the ShelbyAmerican racing
team in favor of the Ford GT program the next year That victory
broke a  year Ferarri winning streak

Well there's lotsa info I could spout but I'll refrain Much of
this information comes from Hot Rod magazine's Shelby American
CobraMustang Guide which has more info on the ShelbyAmerican 
Fords than you could ever want to know

Gads I have heard so many horror stories with Taurus and Sable cars  I thought
these were premium American automobiles  The way they sell you'd think so
Is Ford really no better than in the late 's when it was turning out tin
cans like the Granada and the Fairmount  Which would you get a Taurus or 
a Camry or Accord

 I'd say an RX would be RIGHT up there  You could easily deal down to 
 It has some of the most impressive performance figures around and automotive
 magazines eat it up  One car to seriously consider in that price range

I've heard unconfirmed rumours that there is a new Integra being released
for '

Well you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every
 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life The local acura
dealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon ie MayJune

Its hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from
most of the rest of the world  I have seen them in Canada and Australia
as well as the US but it was discontinued after the first generation
in Europe Normally you can see new Japanese models appear in Europe
or Japan first and extrapolate from there CD reported that the engine
would be a carryover I think

I looked at that Bimmer yesterday It's an ' has about kmi according
to owner odometer stopped working at Kmi Drivess well sounds good
body is OK he wants 
i liked the car despite it's auto tranny but my wife will be a primary
driver on this one and she wants auto
The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn 
The AC seems to have a leak
The sunroof is sticky but operational
Odometer does not work as mentioned before
Idle is a bit bouncy going from rpm to rpm
Wipers are slow
That's teh gripes The owner says that he changed radiator alternator
rotors and calipers exhaust
The biggest problem is that the owner is a shifty SOB telling strange
stories I hate that I would never buy from a persom like that except how
often you see a descent i for that amount of money He also said that
although I could bring a mechanicin he wouldn't let me check the car by taking

it to a garage Suspicious And who knows what milage is on it
So let me know what to check for given there's practically no rust
I know there was an article on i in RD a few years back anybody remembers
what issue
MikeS

DON'T BUY IT  All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches
later on  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably
know BMW's are not cheap to fix either  The owner sounds like a shady
character just trying to take advantage of someone Sure   sounds good
but you should calculate how much the repairs will be It sounds like you
would have to sink in at least   to get everything fixed if not more
Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned Who knows how many
miles are on it and how it was driven  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but
you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear For all you know it
could have  miles on it  The thing you have to remember is that this
isn't the last i around either Just wait and keep shopping For around 
 you can probably find one that is better needs less repair and has
legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering Take it from a guy who
has been taken a couple of times Good luck

the sticker price of either

Or the Torsen differential of the RX compared to the Differential of

Well gee It works and it doesn't break It transmits power to

an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rearends too

Hello  this is the  's 

Well the ' Mustang Cobra which from all reports uses the

Also stop and think about the markets here The Mustang is and
always has been a massmarket sporty car that's where the
pony car class came from with a performance model That's
why it has the econobox running gear That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby it was designed as a widemarket carsporty yet 
accessiblewith room for performance tweaking

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche
and they both fit those niches very well The Mustang at least
does well in multiple markets I can't speak for the Camaro

For an all out sports car I'd go for the RX without the sports
suspension which is too stiff  For a little more practicality and more
comfort the Nissan ZX Turbo is a good buy  And for a good dose of
luxury the Lexus SC is perfect with a manual transmission of course 
However the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks
the performance is supposed to be great almost race car like  I don't
particulary like the Mitsubishi GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are
too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car

I thought that the V was originally designed for a truck not necessarily
a pickup and then just sort of dropped into the Viper's frame because
it fit and was available  A friend of mine and I saw and heard a Viper
and my friend's first response was that it sounded like a truck  It sounded
fine to me but then again I don't like the whiny noise that most modern
sports car engines make  BTW the Viper we saw was moving at about mph
just like all of the other cars on the  freeway heading east out of LA
on a Friday afternoon  Looked really nice though

	Actually I was under the impression that the V in the Viper was
NOT the V that Dodge was developing for its new Kenworths  I have always
thought it was the exhaust system and not the engine that produced the noise
of a car

Well yes the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out but the
basics tone firing cadence etc are determined by the engine configuration
In the case of the Viper yes we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder deg
engine which will sound somewhat like a truck  And my understanding btw is
that that V engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad
aptible for either the trucks or the Viper  And from what I've heard no first
hand knowledge   it's doing a pretty good job at both

And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a degree

	The part about spending  on repairs reminds me
of an article I read in a magazine comparing the  year ownership costs
of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that  The result
which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the
end of the period  That was their argument to prove that you don't go
wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry

	Now if I remember correctly the Camry costs about  or so more
in initial costs  Essentially it means that you spend about  extra
on repairs on the Taurus  That is ridiculous  Every time your car
needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things
I would much rather spend  more in initial costs than spend  more
in repair costs

did you account for depreciation  i seriously doubt that a taurus
would rack up an extra  in repair costs over  years

larger engine  That's what the SHO is  a slightly modified family
sedan with a powerful engine  They didn't even bother improving the
brakes

	That shows how much you know about anything  The brakes on the
SHO are very different   inch or  I forget discs all around
vented in front  The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front 
drums rear

one i saw had vented rears tooit was on a lot
of course the sales man was a fooltitanium wheelsyeah right
then later told me they were magnesiummore believable but still
crap since Al is so m uch cheaper and just as good

i tend to agree tho that this still doesn't take the SHO up to standard
for running  on a regular basis  The brakes should be bigger like
 or sotake a look at the  ones on the Corradoswhere they have
braking regulations

Well let's seemy TBird SC has a computercontrolled adjustable
suspension wheel ABS disks  vented front   rear point
belts sturdy passenger compartment aerodynamics good enough for 
NASCAR without too much change  hp ftlb supercharged l V
wheel independent suspension plus limitedslip differential with 
a top speed in excess of mph and rides on Vrated tires I have yet
to find Rs in any other speed rating 

Is that up to standard If not why not

				James

james i really hate to do this but try reading the damn posts
never was a t'bird mentioned  The discussion was about SHO's and
'stangs not being up to spec  I do not know about t'birds  I
only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded
a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff  This does not
in any way  disencourage me from wishing to own one nor does it make it
a bad car  It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra
bit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes as the wheels are plenty large
enough for them to fit if memory serves right which it may very well not
and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it

 I'm not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but I would ask you if

 before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun
 
I think people have a right to kill to defend their property Why not Be
honest do you really care more about scum than about your  car

Yo Watch the attributionsI didn't say that

Again this isn't an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you
should shoot someone for property damagevandalismtheft but every
responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits and the punishment
must fit the crime I mean think about itis a really harmless
prank worth killing over

As I said the situation described punks setting off alarms and
taunting people to come out could turn very ugly very quickly and
it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on the line

Wrt performance converter lockup is purely irrelevant  The lockup only
occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG  Mind you
a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG but the additional
mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked

And if so is it better to hand wash it about once a month or just take it 
to the car wash anyway

Are detailing places worth the money  if i do a good careful job on washing
and waxing is a detail place going to be worth it

Eve'

I am looking to buy  new pr tires R or HR I don't
have much to spend but I would like a tire that will LAST Does
anyone have any experience with the following brands

	Riken
	Falken	
	BFG	
	General	

There are others but these I can find here for under  Like
I said I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed since I
hardly get to drive them over  or  mph Also is it true that
noone will give you warranty on such tires according to
a tire dealer

Finally do HR tires last longer than R tires threadwear again
or is that strictly a speed factor

Thanks for any replies

 Didn't the Saab Sonnett have a V I recall someone telling that it was
 something like  of a Ford 
 
 Not only the Sonett correct spelling but the  wagon and  sedan
 used a  cc or  cc V from Ford of Germany  This particular
 motor had a  degree vee angle a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
 ports  This motor was later stretched into the V commonly seen in the
 Capri

I think it was the reverse the V being  of the V

 The V could make pretty reasonable power for its size  But in the
 Saab it made too much torque for the transmission which had been
 designed for a cylinder stroke

It was also the worst engine that Ford Europe have ever made  bloody
awful reputation It's most successful application being the Transit
van

Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph  half a Stag V under license I believe but with litre capacity and perhaps a different
arrangement for the cylinder head studs before developing their own straight 
four from the Triumph

I still can't understand all the hype about the Impalla SS it STILL has
the ugly Caprice body Orca on wheels  The Caprice was the worst new
body style to come out of Detroit EVER Now just because the LT engine
and a few suspension tweeks are being added

Its STILL UGLY its STILL a BARGE  GM's answer to everything is throw in
a V and someone will buy it  Or add some plastic ground affects
and a few stickers and call it a GT GTZ or SS and someone will buy it

IMHO GM needs to scrap the Caprice body COMPLETELY and start over with a
BLANK sheet of paper  No minor modification wheel well treatments tail
amp modification or nose redesign or even the LT engine will help
the existing Caprice

re extended Ka bands

I recently bought a  band detector  You guys must all think I'm
nuts right  Well I did a little research into Ka usage in this
area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state
as well as surrounding states  Here's how I found out

 A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
  what Ka is  He's heard of K which is what they use here and I
  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc He then said yeah
  Ka stands for K automatic duuhh  He then went on to say that
  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
  tech were concerned but he didn't know too much

 My  year old  band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps
  even the real sneaky ones

 When I called the Escort Shop they confirmed that Ka is not used here
  or in surrounding states  They did claim that Laser was being used
  a lot here which I was quite skeptical of

So in the end instead of spending a lot of money andor waiting
months for a state of the art detector I got a low priced high
performance  band Escort   Incidentally its performance is equal
to their top of the line model in X and K band detection  I know that
Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately but I've never fully
relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at
least quite good which was good enough for me and my wallet

That's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get  
The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer  
probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory   
kickbacks incentives etc are paid and that often depends on his volume

We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration Let me ask 
a similar question from the aviation field You must have seen images of prop 
planes with all cylinders exposed I have seen up to  cylinders positioned 
radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle 
This arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma How can one crankshaft 
throw accomodate  rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the 
outside

One more way which works in manual trans cars I've driven and it is my
personal favorite the other suggestions above are great but try this
one too  
 
While pushing the shifter gently towards reverse let the clutch out
slowly right to the friction point and the shifter will be pulled into
position If you do it right the car won't jump backward nor will the
gears grind You will just glide back

I can vouch for this method in my  SHO  This is the only sure way of 
putting in the reverse without any problem every time

  Have you head of small claims  You may have to put money up
  front for the filing fees and then possibly having the local 
  sheriff of hisher city to deliver the bad news  In the end 
  the other party will end up paying for hisher mistake with 
  interest from the time of the filing to the pay date of the
  defendent

I think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to
the location of the person you're taking action against  It seems to
me the time and money involved in travelling out there unless this
person is close to you wouldn't be worth it for a small claim
It really depends on how much money you're out

If I am wrong about any of this someone please correct me

Hi everyone


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac The scumster  REP  called my friend and
they agreed on a price My friend unexperienced and not too fluent in
English paid by check requesting REP to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send Well the check was cashed  and that is
that Phone  that REP gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left email address does not
bounce but again there is no answer I know that REP is a student at
University of Delaware I have his email address his US postal address
and his  phone The question is WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED

Thanks in advance for any advice

Sincerely
Victor Levenson VVLHvirginiaedu

PS The reason I did not put REP's full name is that I still hope


PPS If I get enough responses I will post a summary maybe even on a
regular basis

Mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged
keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new A
AEC megsmeg IDE HDHD Floppyv OS  

I'd like to get an A locally for something reasonable like less
than K without monitor  Brand new the Amhz meg HDHD
floppy ROM isn't running for more than  or so

Considering it's damaged probabably has a real old version of the OS
I'll offer   Don't laughmy A isn't worth more than

	MS DOS  Upgrade for sale	best offer over 
	opened unregistered

So does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS is worth upgrading to
How good is it's compression and can it be turned onoff at will
Any other nicenasty features

According to reports if you don't have DOS yet and don't have any
utilities QEMM Stacker PCTools Norton  then DOS may be worth it 

For people who have DOS and some sort of utility DOS doesn't offer
much You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create however

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman
the TCDD which is smaller and less expensive than the D  Also the D
has a coaxial jack which the D lacks  Oh the D has always been
available through mailorder houses for less than  dollars new with
the new model coming out I suspect the now obsolete D will be selling for 
even less

 channels of stereo input and  channel of stereo output but I would
prefer  or more input channels  Each channel needs to have at least a

 In a previous article tomcarezzooasolivetticom Tom Carlino says
 
 Recently I bought a musical instrument through the internet and had
 it shipped to me via UPS ground The shipping was done through a
 mail box service Mailboxes Etc  Being somewhat surprised at the
 price I compared prices of shipping this way to shipping directly
 through UPS and this is a summary  I am not making any endorsements
 or condemnations but merely presenting the facts from which you may
 draw your own conclusions
 
 
 I've encountered the same thing with Mailboxes Etc and I suggest
 anyone to use the original UPS service if at all possible Shipping
 to Virginia from Cleveland was around  for  pounds and COD
 was  as opposed to  for UPS

I'll third the opinion about this outfitfranchise Now when I
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs I'll specify that I
only pick up the normal UPS charges as if delivered directly to
UPS as I've been burned by  shipping charges for a  pkg
I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY I'll also
tell the person if they agreed to pick up shipping what is going on

Other things to watch out forconsider

	The rates are  to  higher than UPS direct

	For a nonUPS truck package they quoted a rate
	of  Fed Ex economy air was only  for the
	same weight RPS a trucking package company in many
	cities only wanted  Guess who got it The Mailbox
	operator told me I was not telling the truth about
	competitors' rates said RPS was unreliable I've used them
	before with NO problems etc Right

	A COD check goes to the mailing service Our local
	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
	remade check All this for an additional  over the
	UPS COD charge What a deal 

	For packages over  they charge you about double over
	what UPS charges them for insurance I've never had
	a claim but other netters is Ralph Seguin out there
	have told horror stories about them

	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by
	Mailbox

	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I
	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
	to direct UPS Does he ever check Probably not

	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy
	air rate and Fed Ex will pick up

	UPS will pick up for a  charge in most areas

So does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS is worth upgrading to
How good is it's compression and can it be turned onoff at will
Any other nicenasty features
 
According to reports if you don't have DOS yet and don't have any
utilities QEMM Stacker PCTools Norton  then DOS may be worth it 
For people who have DOS and some sort of utility DOS doesn't offer
much You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create however 

	IMHO it seems to be worth the  to upgrade  DoubleSpace seems a bit 
saner than Stacker  which I've replaced  MemMaker is nowhere near as 
aggressive as QEMM but it doesn't hose my system like QEMM did at least
it hasn't yet  Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version or a 
reasonably recent one of CPAV  mine was very aged so this was quite welcome

 	MSDOS  ain't the end all be all of operating systems  but it's
better than a sharp stick in the eye unless you happen to be into that sort 
of thing

Jammer 

 Dit is geen fantastische advertentie over neprolexen
 maar een evenzo duidelijke mededeling hieromtrent 

 Aangezien het alleen al aanbieden van deze horloges onder
 vermelding van de echte merknaam niet geheel correct is
 wil ik met dit bericht duidelijk maken dat ik Marcel Engelbertink
 niet meer zal adverteren met imitatiehorloges van het merk ROLEX

 Enig persoon die hierin geiinteresseerd is kan ik jammer genoeg ook niet
 meer helpen




 For all the foreign people who can't even understand dutch  

 In spite of earlier mailing about fakerolex's I announce that I
 don't have any information available any longer and I won't use
 the trade name ROLEX anymore for those fake models

Hi

	I have a Humminbird HDR Depth Sounder for sale It
has been used for  season on my sailboat 
	
	All parts are included as well as the installation
instructions It is even packed in the original box it came in There
is no damage to the unit or the transducer In fact the transducer
was mounted inside the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull
So it led a sheltered life The transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as I did or on the transom It cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull

	It is fully waterproof and fits into a  hole in a bulkhead
that's where I had it installed or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat It reads depth to ' and has a backlit LCD display It has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in 

	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the NMEA  information This little depth sounder works fine
and is very stable


	It is usually priced as low as  in some catalogs I paid 


	The first  takes it or best offer

	MS DOS  Upgrade for sale	best offer over

So does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS is worth upgrading to
How good is it's compression and can it be turned onoff at will
Any other nicenasty features

According to reports if you don't have DOS yet and don't have any
utilities QEMM Stacker PCTools Norton  then DOS may be worth it 

For people who have DOS and some sort of utility DOS doesn't offer
much You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create however 

i installed dos  last week and had nothing but trouble afterwards
windows apps are hitting protection faults more than a kid can do 
to a pinata and it does not seem to like to work with NDOS norton 
dos   other probs include

set pcplusdpcplus for procomm plus no longer works
many of the little utilities to written for dos no longer works
	either mostly shareware

i now have uninstalled dos   and dos  works just fine
are there any apps that dos  will be able to run that dos  wont

 PC Game For Sale 

Waxworks by HorrorsoftAccolade 		   

By the same folks who brought you Elvira I  II  I played
Elvira I  II and think that Horrorsoft has finally made
a very playable game with Waxworks  The look and feel is
roughly the same as in the Elvira games though the real time
fighting is a little easier to survive  The first two games
especially Elvira II Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to
stay alive and hitpoint restoring was very difficult  This 
is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park but it is
quite fair in that there is always some weapon to be found
that is quite effective or hint given as to the proper fighting
strategy  In one of the four wax works to be explored there is 
no fighting at all well almost none though all four contain
moderately challanging puzzles

The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really 
broken up into four seperate RPGs one for each of the four exhibits
you must enter  In starting each one your character is transported
with no objects to use and experience level   One exhibits traps
you inside a multilevel ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must 
escape by fighting mapping and puzzle solving  Another exhibit
traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
and pods while the local humans have been transformed into plant
zombies  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
some humans kill the head plant alien and figuere out how to kill
the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up  This is
perhaps the most horrifying exhibit  Another exhibit puts you into
Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper
victim and of course the police think you are responsible  You must
avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and 
meet him face to face  but first get a disquise  The last exhibit
pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to 
stop the almost indestructible zombies  

Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a 
creepy tone for the game as was the case for the Elvira games though
gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game
I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans   



 All prices include shipping
 All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated
 US buyers only please
 All games will be shipped inside a box with packing insured

assuming no other offers at asking price are made

Oh dear  Let me be the first on my block

You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups
you're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise of any kind people frequently get flamed for announcing
they've got a new book out

I don't know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long
standing custom and it doesn't make much difference from a practical
point of view

So please don't do it again

 Don't bother  it never comes  It's a cheap trick for building a
 mailing list to sell if my junk mail flow is any indication
 
 andy sent his address months ago

Perhaps we can get Portal to nuke this weasal  I never received a 
catalog either  If that person doesn't respond to a growing flame then 
we can assume that we'yall look forward to lotsa junk mail

I don't want him nuked I want him to be honest  The junk mail has
been much more interesting than the promised catalog  If I'd known
what I was going to get I wouldn't have hesitated  I wouldn't be
surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
nope but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results
Similarly there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
aren't happy with the junk they got instead

The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad and
so would the people reading it

Hello NeoGeo owners and nonowners who couldn't resist the title

I was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games  I
mean buying them from the stores can get kinda expensive   is
a little too much to be spending on each game  But ahh the quality
Now I can get them for about  but that's still a lot

Right now I have

Crossed Swords
Magician Lord
Baseball Stars 
Fatal Fury
Nam

I am interested in buying more titles  If any of you have any interesting
trade ideas please let me know


Thanks

Tom

Heise model A pressure meter This is a precision 
digit meter measuring    PSI absolute in  psi
increments  Case is in extremely good shape and can be used
as a standalone meter or panel mounted Brass fitting looks
like standard  on back Operates from  VAC

I'd like  for it or make an offer It is a lot more useful to
a lab than as an ersatz barometer which is what I've been using
it for

of course  if you've owned one of these you understand maybe
a little dust on the cover

where they bought my name

This doesn't help NOT getting junk mail but you at least know who's
selling your name And if you ask companies to NOT sell your name to
mailing liststelemarketeers they are not supposed to as in it's
illegal

And in case you haven't guessed I don't really use Joe Cool



My company maintains a  mailing list which is regularly rented for
one time use by the major software companies  The method you are using to
seed your junk mail isn't really effective  Bulk mailers regulary 
either send their databases to be cleaned by the NCOA which if you've
moved recently will revert back to the original xxx Cool and in large
mailings there will likely be a dupe of you and they'll pick the first and use the
others for future mailings

I have used JVC's top of the line portable cd player for three months now
I have mostly used it in my car on long trips so it has less than  hours of use on it  The unit is one of the best that I have seen and listened to but
I am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car

Features include
	 Hz   Hz
	rechargeable nicad batteries
	wireless remote control
	AC adaptor
	headphones
	carrying belt and case
	digital  band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
		 presets  user programmable
	RCA connections and cord
	JVC compulink capability cord included
	programmable from remote
	intro random repeat playback

I will include a Discwasher tm power converter to convert an automobile's
v DC to the V DC that the unit requires  I had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits JVC makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at Radio Shack etc

I paid  for the disc player and another  for the power converter
I will sell the disc player alone for  or both items for

I hope you realize that for a cellular phone you need to subscribe to a

Hello I have a motherboard and a case for sale as a package
Both of them came from a CompuAdd computer I bought last August and am 
  presently upgrading
Here are the specs

Motherboard

Cyrix SL  MHz microprocessor
Chips and Technology chipset SCATsx V SLSLC
 SIMM banks for a maximum of  Megs of RAM
BUILTIN Floppy and Hard Drive Controllers
BUILTIN ports Parallel  Serial  and  pin
BUILTIN Paradise SVGA controller with  meg of RAM Windows drivers inc
   can do up to x   colors
   based on the Western Digital WDC chip
Math coprocessor slot
 bit expansion slots and  bit expansion slots

Case

LowProfile Desktop
Very nice grey color
 watt power supply
Room for  floppies plus HD

Mouse

button
Microsoftcompatible
Grey color matches case

All original manuals and documentation video drivers etc are included

You are probably wondering why I must sell the case with the motherboard
It is simply because the case is custommade for this particular board and
  you would be hardpressed to fit another MB in it  However the case and
  this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly

As you can see since this board includes drive controllers AND a video 
  controller you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB
  where you would need to get IO cards video card and drive controllers
  Its just a lot more convenient on the whole

I would like to ask about  for this whole package  I think this is a fair
  price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllersIO
  ports  All you need to do is add drives a monitor RAM and a keyboard 
  Also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board but from CompuAdd
I also will entertain all serious offers

Please email at jmuacpubdukeedu

Thanks

This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction  If there
are no new bids then the current bids stand like that's gonna  happen   
After this any updates will be by Email ONLY  The entire auction 
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in  So if you want to get in
on  this be sure to bid now  All bids must be made in AT LEAST
 cent increments  Buyer will pay shipping  Unless you have any
particular fancy it will be US mail th class special with lots of
padding  
All dragons are bagged  The condition of them vary quite a bit 
so I've come up with my own condition system  Some dragons may be missing 
items like the inserts  If you have any questions feel free to ask

Condition ratings  Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover as
most of the material inside is in great shape
Excellent  IEAs you find them in the store
Very Good  Still in great condition but can tell it's been boughten
Good       On down the line
Very Fairfair  indicates lots of use But still decent
Poor        Indicates the material inside may be damaged usually by
scissors  
A  by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is 
missing usually the insert
I'll post another public update sometime this weekend which will be the
final public posting after which the auction will be by email until
the bidding stops

Again if you have any questions ask away

I hope you realize that for a cellular phone you need to subscribe to a
Cellular carrier and it usually takes at least one working day before
the service is available to you Only then you can find out whether 
the phone is working

Tin



Not true  Dial  and listen to the recording  If you get it then your 
phone was recognized by the network  You wouldn't be able to dial a real

I would like to sell my dot matrix printer so I can upgrade to inkjet
It is a Panasonic KXP  pin MultiMode Printer  Here are the
stats from memory and the manual

  x dotprinting for hires graphics etc
  VERY fast up to  cps printing in printercontrolled as
	opposed to Windows drivercontrolled printing
  Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed
   fonts courierprestigebold psscriptsans serif
  Epson LQ and IBM Proprinter X printer emulation
  Can accept single sheets envelopes and  noncarbon copies by
	friction feed
  Front or bottom paper feed
  KB buffer

I will send a sample document and a printed GIFJPEG file to anyone
who wishes to send a SASE  With purchase prepaid please I will
include the following accessories

  Manual
  cable Centronics
  remaining stack of tractorfed paper about 
  FREE copy of Windows printer driver unless this is illegal or if
	it is included with Windows
  FREE unregistered DOS shareware program  registration I think
	that apparently offers some word processing capabilities
	from DOS

The last two will be on a disk either size  I am asking for around
 but I am open to any reasonable offers  I am a college
student so I cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a
considerable portion of the money from this printer  This price
includes all above items and shipping probably UPS is included as
well  I have the original box but only one of the original Styrofoam
end pieces  I will use a towel on the other end you get a free towel
too  Worked fine getting it here  The whole shebang might not fit
in the original box I will figure this out after the offers come in
Email any questions and offers		Jon

    I am very interested in your catalog but Email to you bounces

Don't bother  it never comes  It's a cheap trick for building a
mailing list to sell if my junk mail flow is any indication

I have a copy of this catalog in front of me as I write this
It does have tons of qool stuff in it 
My impression is that they try not to send it out to browsers It
appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to
waste a catalog on you When you get a catalog there's a VIP Code you
have to give them to ensure your continued subscription
Anyway if you want to get in touch with them the company is

They also have fax 's and toll free 's for ordering and tech support

Please note that I am not associated with them in any way In fact I
have never ordered from them so I can't comment on their products or
service but the catalog is real and I am sitting here salivating over
it

In article CJCCGBntsoftnet you write
stuff deleted

My company maintains a  mailing list which is regularly rented for
 
one time use by the major software companies  The method you are using to
seed your junk mail isn't really effective  Bulk mailers regulary 
either send their databases to be cleaned by the NCOA which if you've
moved recently will revert back to the original xxx Cool and in large
mailings there will likely be a dupe of you and they'll pick the first and use the
others for future mailings
 
BTW our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of
a MS Windows utility product in the  range and is available through
                                                   
Direct Media in CT at  per name  Please let your direct mail
                              
marketing rep know about this  Thanks
                                                              
TEd

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products

In addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail  

Am I correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use

I'd offer  for your scanner shipping at your expense payment to
be sent by personal check within  hours after receipt of goods  or if
you live nearby and can deliver payment in cash with  hour advance notice
so I can go to the bank  If sent by mail I reserve the right to return
it at my expense if when I check it out I find it to be defective in some
way

BTW why would you sell such a fine scanner  Did you replace it with
some other instrument or find it not to be satisfactory in some way

Oh dear  Let me be the first on my block

You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups
                                         
 	nit Is he unable to type the first 'h' in this word 

you're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise of any kind people frequently get flamed for announcing
they've got a new book out

I don't know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long
standing custom and it doesn't make much difference from a practical
point of view


	As a matter of fact DJ it does make a difference
	Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year
	many of them are commercial businesses The ban on commercial
	use of Internet is no more

	One should have the breeding not to post commercial material
	on an account provided by ones employer or school unless the
	provider of such account gives permission HA

	Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only
	by our innate good taste and no have no administrator to 
	guide us

I participated a promotion by a company called Visual Images 
They sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked 
me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
award They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package
until one month ago I was mad and angry about how it took them
so long to get my package So I wrote them a letter and requested
for a refund They never return my letter I was lucky enough to
find out their telephone number through operator and received the
package I immediately returned the package and wrote them another
letter to ask for refund The package was returned because they
address they put on the package was incorrect I attempted to 
call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number
It took me at least  phone calls to find out their new number
but they refused to take any responsibility I spoke to their
manager and she said she would call me back but she has not call
yet But I was able to get their address from their front desk
Should I just go ahead and send the package Or should I waite until
they call me back

I know there are several people on the net has experience with the
same company I would like to know how they got their money back
If you have similar experience please advise me

Thanks in advance

Dear Fellow Usenet Users

	I would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement 
about my printing business  I did not intend this to be an advertisement 
but rather an offer for people on the usenet many of whom use printing
on a regular basis  I was not aware that this is not legal on the usenet
I am only trying to put myself through college  For those of you who
requested information I will write to you privately  For those of you who 
are having fun flooding my mailbox I think you can grow up  To offer advice
is one thing but to use profanity toward me is another

Thank you

   After hearing about the McGovern House story on Paul Harvey I never had any
idea how much it was worth  The autograph is on a Senate Pass card
and is signed 'John Kennedy'  I don't remember if it was signed 
'Senator John Kennedy' or whether or not it was dated because I haven't
looked at it in quite a while  Currently it is in a safety deposit box
I would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction
house such as Christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit 
If you or any collector you may know has an interest in this please send
me an email expressing your interest  I will see what I can do to make 
a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers

Summary I am backing out because someone is selling me another
Keywords Digital Audio Tape Sony TCDD DAT Walkman
Organization Purdue University Engineering Computer Network
Date Fri  Apr   GMT
Lines 

        I recently backed out of purchasing an almostunused Sony TCDD DAT
Walkman having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer and am
paying more for  However it's still a heck of a machine for the price  it
is quite rugged and many people out there swear by it  It's probably the
most popular walkmanstyle DAT machine out there

        Anyway the guy selling it is Bryan Davis bdavisnetcomcom and
here's what he told me


Here is what is included
         TCDD DATman
          RCA to Stereo  plug cables  One for analog input one for
          analog output
         Optical digital IO cable one lead for input one for output
         A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase  The
          unit is still under factory warrantee
         AC adaptorbattery charger
         Rechargable battery

I paid   tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the  minute
tape it came with I have some samples on it

By the way he spent at least  too much for it unless he's including an
 extended warranty which is advised for DAT machines since it costs about
  to replace the head when it wears out and it probably will within 
 years if you use it a lot  davisonj


        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him that would not be nice
Send him mail and ask him what he wants

        Again I've used the TCDD and I have to say that I can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is  I've been using one for a little
while and although I had some problems with it recently I should also point
out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been used during that time  This is the same exact DAT machine
that was lugged around the US and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher
Conspiracy for their recent live album

        Bryan Davis says

I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in SF who use that model and have been for a while with no reported
problem  My problem is that everyone I know already has one


        'nuff said

        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a
unit that features phonoplug SPDIF IO instead of optical I don't have any
optical ports on my equipment but you the reader might and it also has
some other bells  whistles that the TCDD doesn't  I am also paying more
for the alternative  Note that phonoplugtooptical SPDIF adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one

        Of course it has SCMS  All consumer decks do  So do Sony Minidiscs
by the way

        Anyway if you're interested get in touch with bdavisnetcomcom

Beware  From what I understand neither the AMD or Cyrix s are clones of 
the Intel   They are using the name  because they run as fast as a 
Intel   They do not have exactly the same instuction set nor do they fit 
into the same socket  Most are very fast s without coprocessors  

AMD recent won the appeal against Intel to use their Microcode so they 
should be putting out real  chips in the near future

The motherboard
     USmade Micronics slot motherboard with Intel dxmhz CPU
     kb SRAM cache
     mb us RAM using xmb simms worth  alone
     Cyrix D math coprocessor worth  alone
     Norton SI  rating of

The casepower supply
      Standard desktop case watt power supply with the usual connectors
      Room for five floppyhard drives three visible two internal

New Micronics CPUs often command a severalhundred dollar premium
over clone motherboards because they are USmade use highquality
components and are known to be both very reliable and compatible They
have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and Zeos at various
points in the past Check out the ads in the back pages of Byte or PC
Magazine if you want to see this price differential for yourself

Price  complete  less if you don't wantneed the case and
power supply The board is fully guaranteed Email for further details

    Laser Disc
    MotherboardJoystickbuttons
     Graphics For arcade cabinet
     Brick Power Supply 
    
 
   Both Space Ace and Dragon's Lair II 

 
   These games require a Sony  Laserdisc player  The
nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
normal Laserdisc movies on it as well  I have one which I
will sell for  by itself  with a purchase of one
complete system or  if you buy both systems
 
    I currently run this into my entertainment center  I have
it housed in a PC computer case with with its own fan and 
power supply  I run the audio into my stereo system and the
laserdisc runs directly into the TV  I have made a mount for
the joysticks and the buttons  First person who buys both
games will get it all otherwise you have to do it yourself
 
    If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
arcade cabinet this can be done as well  The graphics will
go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet
 
    Everything works perfectly  The laserdisc player has an
RS port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
type applications  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
place and have no scratches on them
 
    If you are interested please email me
 
    Thanks

The only option you should jumper is the drive select shown as CC
above  There is also a drive powerup option jumper elsewhere on the
drive's board but the odds of that having been unset are slim

Since the B normally has only one HD you would jumper betwwwn C to
select the first possible drive address if the  is your second drive
on the B then jumper between C

Items for sale

This package was bought throught a award giveaway company I attempted
to cancel my order before I received the package but I was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund I know the truth
which I would never get my  back but I wish to get my money back as
close as possible Here is the describtion of the package

Nishika D camera	It takes very good picture never been opended
			or used It came with wide angle flesh carring
			case film and a instruction video It has four
			lens and created a D effect on a regular mm
			film

Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift

Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport
			The users get a special hotel rate of  perperson
			pernight Meals ground transfer hotel tax is
			not included

Las Vegas Reno Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare and
				hotel accomodation for  days  nights
				Meals ground transfer hotel tax is not
				included The voucher is good for all 
				locations but you can't travel to all 
				places at once

Cancun Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare and hotel
			accomodation for  days   nights Meals and
			ground transfer hotel tax is not included as
			usual

I paid  for the whole package So try not to be coldblooded when you
make your offer Details would be provided by request I do wish to sell
the whole package at once So if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
If you are interested in the camera you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift

If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards 
Trust me you would get the exactly the same package as I did There is 
only one award which will be given away So don't bother even to call them 
back if you are really interested you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price And you could receive the package within a week  I waited three 
months to get my first and final packages Also they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company So why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price

If you are interested please reply to me as soon as posible I really
wish to get this over with Make me an offer if I am confortable with
your offer I would send the package by UPS the next day morning
More details could be given if you wish

I am selling my FIAT  Spyder

	This sleek little convertable has served me well through my past
year in San Diego but I am going away for the summer and I have nowhere
to keep it so on the aution block it goes

	 Fiat  Sport
	White body
	White Hard Top refurbished
	Ivory Convertable Top refurbished
	New Black interior
	
	Come with high performance exhaust system
	Larger rebuilt engine  instead of 
	Car mats
	Smog checked registered until 

This is the ultimate in San Diego driving I will not guarantee that
this car will attract people to you of the opposite gender but they
will ask for a ride One warning this is a high performance Italian
SPORTS car if you want a boring little set of wheels this is NOT the
car for you this car requires care It has a manual choke a speed
manual transmision manual throttle control and even manual wiper
pump If you KNOW how to drive then and only then can you appreciate
this car

Feel free to inquire The price is  and all inspection has to be in
the San Diego area since school keeps me here all the time

Each projector viewer will equal trade for  or  Kodak projector lenses

   I have a pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro  It's both a fast
printer with LQ and a very sophisticated design  It has a straight paper
path and the capability of autoforwarding sheets to tear off and then back
a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current
print out  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed
and has sophisticated preferences options you can interactively program
all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without
ever using a computer  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup
and default set up  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought
it three years ago for   It is also Epson LQ compatible besides it's
own modes and comes with IBM driver software which I've never used since I
own an Amiga  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts

    I'll let it go for  including shipping prepaid  COD orders must pay
all shipping and COD costs

   Adisak Pochanayon  



   Also a light gun and UFORCE controller for Nintendo but with PD driver
software to use them on the Amiga  The light gun is fully remote no wires
Best offer over   less than my cost and they are both brand new

  Does anyone know what the jumpers should be set to on the Maxtor

	  Useful info about the Maxtor drive deleted  

Since the B normally has only one HD you would jumper betwwwn C to
select the first possible drive address if the  is your second drive
on the B then jumper between C

	However Thad you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'PC' not 'UNIXPC'  Also note the strange crossposting as he
probably did not so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on  If it is a PC or clone then the C jumper would be
the correct choice

	I've left the crossposting in effect since I'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in

 If you would like to buy any of the above items please mail me
 at jackacsbuedu Also a  automatic discount will apply if
 your total purchase price is  or more except the two brand
 new items Buyers pay shipping
 
 If you think the prices I listed above is unrealistic please mail
 me back and I would take your advice into consideration and make the
 proper adjustments

 The reason I am selling this stuff is because I have decided that
 I had enough with this hobby of PC computing and I want to move on
 other interests

 One last thing if you know any nonprofit organization whom might
 be interested in my equipments please let me know Because if no
 one wants to buy them I might as well donate them and get a tax
 break

 Thanks

  Sorry for any confusion I may have created  The disk did come out of

any replies

   I have a few the original IBM Mb harddisks for sale They are actually
Seagate's ST MFM full height  has the IBM logo and black face plate 
 
  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS  It can be doubled to 
Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and antistatic bags I am not sure if they were ever 
used but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order 
 
  each plus shipping cost about  
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs this is for you   It's cheaper
than a floppy drive

I have numerous  series scopes which are surplus to requirements
These devices range from fully functional to having a fault which
remained unrepaired since they weren't needed any longer

My query is is there anybody in Australia interested in buying them

I think the shipping costs would make it impractical to send them OS
Certainly the mainframes but if you're willing to pay shipping I'll
consider offers for individual plugins

For those who are in the know anywhere in the world what are these 
bits worth second hand in your area

I have
		 Mainframes
		A Vertical Amp
		AA Vertical Amp
		A Vertical Amp
		A Differential Amp uV  Div  MHz  CMRR
		B Timebase
		BA Timebase
		B Timebase

in addition I have the following which have been smoke damaged in a fire
and although washed are probably a little more prone to failure than
the others

		 Mainframes
		N Mainframes
		A Vertical Amp
		AA Vertical Amp
		B Timebase

Overall I suspect that the A's are worth as much as all the rest
put together All bar one of these are operational  that one failed
and has never been repaired because it was no longer needed

The A has an onboard voltage offset as well as switchable high
and low pass filters There is nothing on the market to my
knowledge that comes close to the specs of this plugin

All of the above have service manuals

Hello fellow humans and other net creatures
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise please email me
djkccwfccutexasedu
 
I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system so I have
two monitors and cards for sale Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space and get all of my info from one
screen
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas within
driving distance  like an hour away perhaps but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors but I'm confident that my few months of fulltime service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction
 
Details
 
Mirror Full Page Display monochrome wnubus card

SOLD
 
Sony   color monitor

What's to say It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report It's a SONY
Trinitron arguably the best but I'd rather not argue that point
It's a great monitor in great shape but I'm going to a bigger screen
and although I'd like to keep it finances don't justify it
 
Still selling for  at MacLand where I bought it originally  not
including shipping will sell for  was  orig asking price
plus shipping Again make an offer if that sounds unreasonable
 
 
RasterOps si bit accelerated hardware zoompan  meg RAM

Renamed the sx a few months after I bought it this board is for 
monitors providing accelerated bit hardware zoompan NTSC mode
you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC and  RAM slots that use  meg or  meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM or a
RAM disk Software included for such functions  meg of RAM included  meg
SIMMS
 
Selling for  at Bottom Line without the RAM  add  I'm asking
 was  orig asking priceshipping included this time
it's just a card Original box and packaging I'd actually prefer to sell
the Sony monitor and this card together so if you want both drop me email
and make a bundled offer for these items
 
If you check the May  or was it Feb  Macworld mag you'll find that the
sx or si  same thing board did extremely well in the tests for 
 x  bit boards Also supports up to  or so x  in bit so
you can fit two pages widthwise via the scrolling desktop thang It's a great
board but I'm going to a  monitor and it can't help me there

Hi to all

Since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer I'd like to bring
this issue for discussion  what would be the best solution in case a deal 
became a lemon

As I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warrantyI am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order The seller insisted
that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it
is bad Is this reasonable

Basically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth Also I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of 
the thing My assumption here is everyone is honest  so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars

I would like to hear your opinion  either in here or directly respond to my
email address

I know there is such a risk that you could lose money But how can we make it
enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth

I'm sure that the Motorola is worth it but this kind of thing
has always mystified me   is the price of very good new
dualband fully synthasized HT  Yes yes I know Motorola
HTs are bulletproof unbreakable plutoniumbased 
indestructable  you can drive a tank over them and they'll
still work  But just how often does that come up  Why are hams
willing and they are to spend the price of a synthaszied
dualbander for a channel xtal rig  Note this is not
a flame as I said I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig
I'm just amazed that it is a good deal  I would have guessed
that a  channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual
bander to a ham no matter how durable Just shows you how wrong
I can be

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products
In addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail  
Am I correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use

 I had the front panel of my car stereo stolen this weekend

 I need to buy the front panel of a Sony XRU car stereo

 If by any chance anyone has had the body of a Sony XRU
 stolen and has an otherwise useless front panel I would 
 love to buy it from you

 If you know anyone who had a removeablefrontpanel car stereo
 stolen from them could you please forward this message to them

 Thanks

 Kris

I was my understanding that the purpose of those removeablefrontpanels
were to make the radio useless and thus discourage theft that is if the 
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left

If those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio 
originally costs or even sold at all
then the above discouragement wouldn't be so great

I personally would be unhappy if I bought a radio like that thinking that 
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio's value and the covers were
sold by the company or other legitimate source cheaply
 
If you cut here you'd ruin your monitor

Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses cameras and photo stuff
that's not being used  Some are gems some are mundane
 
 
Minolta AF  lens for Maxxum cameras  New lens but I guess it'd
be best to call it a demo since I did not get the literature box or
warranty cards  
 
Vivitar X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses  Pretty cute flip back
tang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses  and bodies
It will even couple and double a nonAI lens to an AI body  
 
Pentax  screwmount lens  Well actually it's a SuperTakumar which
is what they all were back then  Very mint condition   Nice hard
case for this lens  more
 
Alpex  lens  Beautifully made all metal construction with fine
optics  Minolta mount    Another hard case that fits this with
strap can be addedcall it  more
 
Vivitar  flash  The one that made Vivitar famous until the 
eclipsed it  Tilt head removable sensor variable auto exposure

 
Universal Roamer  folding old bellows camera with leather case
Uses  or  film mm F lens  Kinda cool articulated shutter
release  Decent shape  
 
Weston  lightmeter  Nothin super fancy but it works well and is a
good cross check to built in meters   with case and strap
 
And finallythe gems
 
Pentax Auto  camera with mm F lens  This is the little
and I do mean TINY SLR that Pentax made  Has interchangeable lenses
but try and find the  zoom true through the lens viewing with
split image focus and completely auto exposure  
 
Olympus RC rangefinder camera  A really cute little camera with mm
lens F with built in manual or auto exposure self timer etc  I
think this was the predecessor to the XA  and it's nearly all metal
I won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell  
 
Olympus OM with flash shoe leatherette case  Zuiko lens and
Tokina SD Super Dispersion  lens  These are all in very nice to
mint condition except for one little ding on the OM body near the film
advance lever  Lenses are perfect and the Tokina is a very compact
and sharp lens   for the set
 
 
That'll do to clean out some of the stuff  Feel free to offer on this
stuff although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in
shipping it
 
For more details call or email

Fellow netters

I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there even outside of Iowa  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
space but I thought you might want some relief from the Soandso is a thief
posts  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while

After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups I mailed Mr Mark Miller a
request for his copy of WordPerfect  for DOS  He suggested a price of 
in his ad but when I phoned him he quoted  plus shipping  That sounded
more than fair to me so I told him that I would send him a check the next day 
Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold after I had just mailed
the money order  After another EMail message to him he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake  I was the one who he was holding it for  He
sent the package as soon as he got the money along with a letter stating a
transfer of license  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect so I asked him
to fill out one of their forms  No problem  we thought  It took three times
to get it to the right address my fault  Anyway he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the
deal  Again he apologized for not sending it before  I now have the world's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat
you may want give him a call  If I had the choice I would purchase all of my
software from him

Bravo Mr Miller

The front covers should be available from Sony  Check with a local car
stereo shop  You will probably definitely have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card  I 
don't know the cost but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover so it stands to reason that it can be replaced

As to deterring theft

When I worked for a stereo shop we referred the customer to a Sony 
number  We would not sell the face nor did we have them available  Most
people who came in asking for the face cover or a pullout sleave for that
matter would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use  If theft occurs with these decks notify Sony  Serial
numbers do catch theives

Just a thought

My little Nash has sat for about a year had been running but now I must move
a long distance and there are too many things to carry with me  Here are the
details of the car

 HardtopExterior condition
     Rocker panels rusted out at weld points no rust at typical spots like
     door hinge mounting points back battery box etc  Missing front bumper
     front pan dented up one weld popped in front  This is for the most part
     a solid restorable automobile

     Interior Condition
     Missing original steering wheel has one of the smaller aftermarket
     wheels seats need reupholstered general fair condition

     Mechanical Condition
     Had been running but now does not want to startneeds new rings which
     I have also have extra parts such as complete long block extra steering
     shaft etc

For a car that has not been touched since  it is in solid shape  It will
obviously need some work but will make a good project

PRICE  Well this is a tough one I would like to get around  but will
consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it If you 
have things to trade such as tools toys cameras comics cards etc 
anything easily movable to Florida I may consider that as well

Sounds a little odd but I sold an Amiga hand scanner to
an elementary school teacher in south Florida Miami I
think but I have just recently found that I still have
the scanner manual  The original shipment included the
software manual disks packaging etc

Basically I have since lost the name  address of the 
person I  sold it toand I would like to get it to him

If that person sees this please send me an email to

Inreplyto Jack Previdi's message of Thu  Apr   GMT

Jack Previdi ppsilinkcom writes in reply to Dorothy Heydt
reminding us that advertising is not done on Internet

	   As a matter of fact DJ it does make a difference
	   Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year
	   many of them are commercial businesses The ban on commercial
	   use of Internet is no more

Jack there is a difference between using the network for commercial
purposes and advertising in newsgroups  Business communication is
okay  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet
who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay

	   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only
	   by our innate good taste and no have no administrator to 
	   guide us

I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not
in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention
it didn't want  You may belong to the public library but that
doesn't mean you can deface the books disorder the stacks or disturb
the other patrons

You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users many
academic and military who get irritable about a network for which
they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business
advertising follow  There are Secret Masters here just like
everywhere else  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy but
they're here

No doubt at some point the Internet like everything else will become
grotty enough to carry advertising  At that time I hope it is
confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groupslike

   The Catalog of Personal Computing Tools for Engineers and Scien
   tists lists hardware cards and application software packages for 
   PCXTATPS class machines  Focus is on engineering and scien
   tific applications of PCs such as data acquisitioncontrol 
   design automation and data analysis and presentation  

   If you would like a free copy reply with your U S Postal 
   mailing address

Don't bother  it never comes  It's a cheap trick for building a
mailing list to sell if my junk mail flow is any indication

I have a copy of this catalog in front of me as I write this
It does have tons of qool stuff in it 

That's one  Any others

My impression is that they try not to send it out to browsers

Then they should have used a different advert

It appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to
waste a catalog on you

I'm both  I've made some k worth of PC products purchasing
decisions for one company I'm affiliated with in the past  months
alone  In a delicious bit of irony an interesting fraction went to
suppliers that I suspect got my mailing address from these people
More is in the pipeline right now

If they wanted to discuss these sorts of things upfront is the
way to do it

When you get a catalog there's a VIP Code you

And who issues that VIP Code  That policy implementation in the
running for this week's silly twit award  BTW  It turns out that
I have several VIP codes  Here's the one I'm using for these sorts of
things   If you want one send me mail and I'll put you in touch
with the folks who do the application interview if you qualify

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products

The net is not supposed to be a dumping ground for free ads but
reserving it for tripe doesn't seem to be a significant improvement

In addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail  

So  Either they target it well enough to pay for it in other words
they manage to send it to people who want the stuff in which case it
is junk only for the rest and the transaction costs are borne
appropriately in this case or they go bankrupt  Seems fair to me

Am I correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use

You could hold your breath  You could kill offending messages as
they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further
but not until you turn blue

Hi All

I have a Korg DVP for sale for   shipping  For those who've not
had the pleasure

It is a MIDI controlled no keyboard of it's own rackmountable digital voice
processor  What can it do with your voice  It can pitchshift it change the
notes you sing  It can add harmonies to your singing up to  parts at one
time  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what
you say alone and intelligible  This works well for a computerized sounding
singer or robot voice  For those of you who just thought about that yes 
you can do the voices from RoboCop and the old ELO leadins with it and yes 
I'm a little redfaced to say that I tried those specifically  For an input
it takes both XLR prong mic and  cables  For output you can have
a combination of the originalinputonly and your choice of mix between the
original signal and the effect can be effect only if desired  It has preset
setups which you can edit and save for your own preferences  It has a couple
of light scratches but does not look bad and works flawlessly  Even when we
don't use it in my music it's been good for afterhours fun in the studio
The manual is included  I never got around to getting rackears for it but
it has only gotten studio use from me  no roading so it's not beaten
 
      oooooooo       o     o                      Steve Hitch

Asking for  or best offer

I paid  for the whole package And it is too late for me to get the 
refund I would sell it for  for the whole package Details could be 
provided by request I do wish to sell the whole package at once So if 
you are just looking for the vacation vouchers I don't care if you 
sell the camera to other for a higher price If you are interested in 
the camera you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift

Some of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you 
are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out 
of five awards Trust me you would get the exactly the same package as 
I did There is only one award which will be given away So don't 
bother even to call them back if you are really interested you could 
get it from me for a cheaper price And you could receive the package 
within a week  I waited three months to get my first and final packages 
Also they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay 
for the interest to the credit card company So why spend more than you
should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price

If you are interested please reply to me as soon as posible I really
wish to get this over with Make me an offer if I am confortable with
your offer I would send the package by UPS the next day morning
More details could be given if you wish

In the FOR SALE department

	Technics model  autoreverse openreel STEREO tape deck  Because
	it's autoreverse this deck records onto tape just like a cassette
	deck does so it's not very good for splicetype editing  However
	I have used it effectively in tape studio applications for mastering
	and it works great   and  ips speeds supports up to  reels
	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators  Full autoreverse
	capable and the mechanism works too  Adjustable sound on sound
	and socket for remote control I don't know where you'd find one but
	they used to make 'em plus a VAC unswitched outlet  This unit
	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got
	itworks perfectly

	Price   or best offer or possible trade see below


	Panasonic KXP printer  pin with xdpi resolution in both
	text and graphics modes  Warranty cards manuals all the usual stuff

	KXP by the way  Test prints are available upon request

	Price   obo or trade


	Excalibur custom pool cue   oz  mm brass joint Irish linen
	wrap could use a new tip but will hold up for a while  I've got too

	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST  preferably  with appropriate
	DOS and Workbench

	 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga

	Amiga hard drive and controller preferably SCSI

	IBMcompatible hard drive and controller if not MFM  This one's 
	touchy as I have a fullheight and don't have room for more unless

	good ST in the deal

	Intel EX or EX or similar EXTERNAL highspeed modem


This is not a complete list but it's close  If you've got something way off
the track of this list it's probably not going to interest me at this point

If both paries do this then the transaction will obviously 
be COD  This allows both parties to exercise the amount of
trust they see fit


COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 
for a brick Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a COD it's fine till a stop payment is made There are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction Even with
merchants and customers there are problemsstolen credit cards 
chargebacks no return policies and getting the wrong item etc

About the only protection available to to do business with someone you
trustsomeone who has been around for a while

A very good RB group came out in  called the Pasadenas  I bought their
cassette single and fell in love with it  I've tried to find their LP
or CD but have had no success whatsoever  Just wondering whether anyone
out in Netland had heard of them

their song that hit the charts was called Tribute


thanks

Well I'm not sure I'd go quite that far but I agree that Motorola
gear is of better quality  The question is how much that quality
is worth to a ham in amateur service not commercial service

This radio can hear a repeater thats  miles away without
 an antenna

Ok great But how often does that come up  How good is
good enough and how much is someone willing to pay for it
A good hamquality HT is maybe  while a commercial
quality one is maybe  Is the increased reliability and
performance worth  times the price in amateur service
Only the individual involved can answer that question and each
ham has to decide for himherself  If Motorola quality is worth
 times the price to you then more power to ya' But I'm amazed
that folks make that choice For me given that I've got  to
spend I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over
a Motorola ht alone no matter how good it is  To me hamquality
gear is good enough To each his own

	I have some brandnew shrinkwrapped boxes of  floppy disks that I
would like to sell  They are all M disks

  boxes of  SSSD  floppy disks
  boxes of  DSDD WWP  floppy disks

Misco is selling the SSSD M disks for  for a box of ten and they are
selling the DSDD M disks for  for a box of ten  I will take the
best offer I can get for the disks as many boxes as you want

	I also have a quantity of  floppy disks that 
some people were getting rid of probably due to an upgrade to a newer drive
system  All the disks are used and most have labels on them but they all 
appear to be in good physical shape  However I make no guarantees of the
quality of these disks  Here are the statistics

Quantity	Make	Type

		M	Single sideDouble densitysoft sector bytesrecord
		Memorex Single sideDouble densitysoft sector bytesrecord

I will accept the best offer I receive for the disks and I'm willing to sell
them off in different amounts the minimum being a box of ten if I get no
offers on these disks I would considering throwing them in with the new
disks I'm selling above 

I also have a headcleaning kit for  disk drives for which I will take
the best offer I can get

All sales are final

I would prefer to ship COD and add the shipping costs onto the total order 
cost

I have an old Optonica tuner and integrated amp that I no longer
use  The integrated amp section does not work right now but should
not cost much to fix  I believe that it is just a Chip  I have 
used it as a preamp and it works great

This is a very nice looking and well built set  They both are low 
profile but the amp is rather heavy

The tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp

The amp is rated at wch

These peices went for about  New

I would like to get   obo  for the pair 

If anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp I have had an estimate
done that it should cost less than  in parts

     Release  could do but not as much of it  Worksheet

     that can be accessed by Release   Includes manual
     original distribution diskettes    K and key
     board templates


o Subaru Service Manuals  
     This is not a complete set but includes sections   
       which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS suspension wheels 
      axles steering brakes pedals  control cables heater 
      ventilator air conditioning BODY body  exterior

     panel and ELECTRICAL engine electrical system body

     dovetail corners in the drawers  Built we think around

Bare means what it says You get a case a power supply and a motherboard
with RAM and a coprocessor Everything else is yours to add as you like

The casepower supply
  
      Standard desktop case watt power supply with the usual connectors
      Room for five floppyhard drives three visible two internal

The motherboard

     USmade Micronics slot motherboard with Intel dxmhz CPU
     kb SRAM cache
     mb us RAM using xmb simms worth  alone
     Cyrix D math coprocessor worth  alone
     Norton SI  rating of 
     Latest version Phoenix BIOS


Please do not postemail saying but I can get a Taiwanese SuperClone
 for only  including a free toaster I am certain you can
find a cheaper Brand X board without even breaking a sweat New Micronics
CPUs command a severalhundred dollar premium because they are USmade
use highquality components and are known to be both very reliable and
compatible They have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and
Zeos at various points in the past Check out the ads in the back pages
of Byte or PC Magazine if you want to see this price differential for
yourself

Price  complete  less if you don't wantneed the case and
power supply The board is fully guaranteed Email for further details
or for any questions

Thanks

I am not a company thus this is not a commercial sale  

I purchased  Tshirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through 
We didn't have the time to sell the shirts  I have about  shirts
left and I am willing to sell them to you for  a piece more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts
even in bulk  That's  for  shirts  These shirts are Jim
Morris Tshirts  They are all  cotton and most have more than 
colors  They are clean and neatly folded in a box  If any happen to
be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it your option  You could sell them for at least  to  a piece
the higher number is for the nicer shirts to raise money for a school
event or a organization  I realize it is a big investment but it could
pay off big

I would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of  but only at  a
shirt  I will pay shipping but prefer local buyers and will give them
more bargaining power

Please help me  I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need
the money  I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap  I will give
you Jim Morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices

All prices are negotiable

Truman

Please email tfandrewcmuedu and tell all of the clubs in the area
about this deal  Once they're gone they're gone cause I am not a
business

I have a UREI A band mono Equilizer for sale  Anyone who knows
this unit knows it's been a recording studio standard for years  It's a
pretty straightforward unit with balanced ins and outs  Power supply caps
were recently replaced and I added XLR connectors which can be easily
removed if you prefer as I mounted them on a bracket outside the case 
The unit is in good shape and is sonically very clean

I'm asking   UPS shipping  They're going for  generally  Make me

Please refer to  he is selling  for that CPU

Correct   may be high now that AMD has started selling  clones


You're both dreaming That guy who is selling at  is ripping himself off and
once those chips are gone it'll be a while before you see that price again AMD

I recently purchased an IBM monochrome vga monitor from Mike Damico The
monitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable Mike's address is
apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it If anyone
knows how to contact Mike and could help me find him I would appreciate it
I am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor
but it would be a lot more useful to me if I had the cord as well

I have an Altos  System V Unix system for sale I actually have two

base configuration depending on what you want

   MHZ CPU
  meg of ram
 Fifteen  serial ports or more if you want
 A multidrop port for up to  more serial ports
 Ethernet
  floppy drive
 QIC  cartridge tape drive
  meg ESDI hard drive either Micropolis or CDC or both if you want
 Unix System V installation
 Networking software package TCPIP
 Development system software package C compiler and libraries

I am asking only  firm for the system If you want another Ethernet or
serial card add  Additional disks are  each I can install a total of
three ESDI drives I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive

This box would make a great BBS system or terminal server It was originally
designed to service  active users and up to  moderately active users
This is NOT a PC It was designed to be a Unix box from the start and it's
very fast and exceptionally reliable

It's dimensions are approximately ' high tower  wide and  deep

I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up

I still have about  records left on hand all in pristine condition
except where noted quite a few outofprint and more than a few
imports in the bunch

Rather than selling the majority for  each I'm looking to barter
packages for stuff that you might be selling over USENET  I'll also
trade for other records in very good condition that you've replaced
with CD as well as prerecorded videos on Beta or VHS  In the past
I've been able to make deals based on the equivalent liststore price
eg  CD   movie in Beta format to get around what you or I
might have originally paid as if we can even remember   

At this time I'm looking for a set of working AA NiCad rechargable
batteries  if you have some lying around and they're sound RSVP

So if you're curious RSVP for my list and if you see anything that
you like send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of
your ad for the stuff you're selling  thanks

gld

 ie the imports and outofprints are also valued at  used CD

 I once got a  baud external modem for  records list 
Anybody got a nice unused blender for making frozen margaritas 

PS There have been NO additions since the last posting in February
        the list has only shrunk as I've made a few deals since

This device when used with a VCR tuner will allow you to
have a second channel popped up on any corner of the screen
The you can press SWAP on the remote and the small picture
will be swapped with the main picture

The only limitation to this box is that it is has  channel
tuner This means that the box itself cannot tune higher
than cable channel  However if your VCR tuner is capable
of tuning higher than this then you simply tune the VCR to the
channel desired and then swap pictures assuming the alternate
picture is channel  or lower and it will work fine

Original cost

Items for sale

This package was bought throught a award giveaway company I attempted
to cancel my order before I received the package but I was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund I know the truth
which I would never get my  back but I wish to get my money back as
close as possible Here is the describtion of the package

Nishika D camera	It takes very good picture never been opended
			or used It came with wide angle flesh carring
			case film and a instruction video It has four
			lens and created a D effect on a regular mm
			film

Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift

Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport
			The users get a special hotel rate of  perperson
			pernight Meals ground transfer hotel tax is
			not included

Las Vegas Reno Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare and
				hotel accomodation for  days  nights
				Meals ground transfer hotel tax is not
				included The voucher is good for all 
				locations but you can't travel to all 
				places at once

Cancun Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare and hotel
			accomodation for  days   nights Meals and
			ground transfer hotel tax is not included as
			usual

I paid  for the whole package So try not to be coldblooded when you
make your offer Details would be provided by request I do wish to sell
the whole package at once So if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
If you are interested in the camera you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift

If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards 
Trust me you would get the exactly the same package as I did There is 
only one award which will be given away So don't bother even to call them 
back if you are really interested you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price And you could receive the package within a week  I waited three 
months to get my first and final packages Also they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company So why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price

If you are interested please reply to me as soon as posible I really
wish to get this over with Make me an offer if I am confortable with
your offer I would send the package by UPS the next day morning
More details could be given if you wish

Computer Equipment Garage Sale

I've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff
that is broken or not being used by me  I've put together a list and
indicated what I think each item is worth  This is just my estimate and I
am very open to any offers including trades  I'm currently looking for
some CDROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies HD floppy 
disks any used Macintosh software a Mhz CoProcessor or basically 
anything you have lying around cans of soup the neighbor's cat etc  
Make me an offer no offer will be overlooked 
I really want to get rid of this stuff

Ok Here's the list

 Meg  SCSI Hard Drive  Conner Model CP  I bought this from a guy
	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh  Unfortunately I can't seem 
	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer  The
	guy tested it with his PC and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk 
	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors I'll send you a copy 
	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number so I can't return it to 
	him The drive has many jumpers on it which I don't know how to set 
	so maybe that's the problem  I was quite disappointed that it didn't
	work so I'm trying to minimize my losses	

 Meg  SCSI Hard Drive Conner Model CP  Same situation as above
	I bought both of these drives from the same guy  Despite the different
	model numbers they are the same exact drive  Same report from NDD
	I have one for each drive will be included	

 Meg SONY  SCSI Hard Drive  SONY Model SRDA  The drive mechanism 
	is completely trashed  This hard drive was in my computer Mac SE and
	had a stiction problem  Well repeated banging on the side of the
	computer resulted in a head crash yes metal scraping metal which
	was not too pleasant to listen to  Still the SCSI controller
	card is in good working order and can be used for parts or a 
	project	

 Meg Seagate  HH SCSI Hard Drive  Model STN  I originally bought
	this drive because it had a small stiction problem and I though that
	I could fix it  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine
	and that it was a controller problem  motor controller wasn't sending
	proper signals  Well after taking the controller off the drive 
	looking at it and putting it back together I realized that I
	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 
	drive to the controller  I tried to solder it but I'm not that good
	at soldering so I couldn't do it  Worked perfectly before I messed
	up  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY above crashed on
	me  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications
	worth well over   Claris CAD MS Word  Think C
	Excel and many others 
	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable  You also get all
	the software on the drive if you can accept being a pirate  I only 
	ask that you delete my data files from the drive  I was really angry
	when I broke that connection and then couldn't fix it  I just don't 
	have time to play with it any more	

ATT ISDN  Modem  This is for use on digital phone systems  If you know
	what this is or would like technical information on it let me know  I
	have some tech documents on it  Is supposed to be the same thing as an
	ATT digital phone but without the phone part  It seems to be in  
	working order passes self test perfectly OK  I have no idea how 
	this is worth   Let me know if you're interested

Motorola  CoProcessor  I haven't tested this one out yet but if anyone 
	is interested I will get it tested out to make sure that it works  I
	had trouble using it with my accelerator board but then I spoke to the
	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without 
	another controller chip  When I was looking around to buy one new the
	prices were around   I will guarantee this to work	

CGA Card  HalfLength bit  Wasn't working last time I checked although
	I think I was using a bad monitor	

	K Floppy Drive  IBM Drive Type   Guaranteed to work 
	because when I took it out of the PC it was working		

 K Floppy Drive  Toshiba Model Number NDDEA  Guaranteed to 
	work  Came out of same PC as above	

	Floppy Drives  Can't guarantee that these will work  I don't
	even know if they are low or high density drives  I don't have
	any method of testing them
		Panasonic Model number JU ACG  There's another
			number on it 
		Panasonic Model number JU AGG  There's also
			another number on it H
		Toshiba Model Number NDDE  Virtually identical to the one 
			above
	Each Drive 

 PS Drive  These things are proprietary so I can't test it but I
	think it works  Not sure if it's high density or low density but I
	suppose someone who is looking for one would know  Model Number
	DFLCA  I think these things are expensive to replace  

MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards  I've got three of these and I have no way
	of testing them  Two of them are bit cards and one is a sixteen bit
	card with a floppy controller built in	 for the bits  for
	the bit card wfloppy

Interesting cable  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug  That is
	standard ninepin to VGA  pin Made by Hewlett Packard  Part No
	D		



I've sold stuff like this before and it was a huge success with many 
satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore  I 
usually ship through the US Postal Service haven't had any problems yet 
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated

Well that's all folks  As I said before no offer will be refused  If you 
can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out TRY  I hate
to throw away stuff

This posting reminded me about a longstanding question I've had
Does it
pay to consider an underwater camera for pictures taken on land but
in
harsh environments eg rain snow heat cold mud dust Or are
the
lenses etc all tuned for the refractive index of water

I have had a Nikon LAW since  Unfortunately it is no longer
made It is a P  S sealed to resist water to a depth of  feet It
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions It takes AA batteries hooray It has the solid
heavy feel of oldstyle Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have
been able to give it This includes a lot of water rain river and
sea desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
didn't scare the mugger away hitting him with the flying camera
did This is my never be without a camera camera The current
waterresistant Sport Touch I think is the name model is nothing
like as solid or well sealed

Recently I got a case of Hot Shots ' cards  Unfortunately I had
not planned on keeping all of them  I sort of got stuck with the
case  I'm not going to mention any names though

So I am trying to sell off most or all minus a set for myself

If you have any interest in a set a box or any singles please let
me know

The set has  cards  Each card features a great looking woman in
various stages of dress  Some nude seminude lingerie dressed
 percent are gorgeous I feel

There are  subsets

Girl Girl Girls    through 
Promo cards    through  also numbered  of  through  of 
Emperor's AllStars    through 
Stripping Empress    through 

Also I am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well

Oh and lastly I have a very few error cards and a few cards
that were originally intended to be used as card  but the
company changed their mind  None of these cards are easy to get

Anyway if you have some interest in any of these cards please
drop me a line as I am most eager to sell a bunch off

Oh and if you are interested I also have  set of Hot Shots '
left and about  sets of California Dreaming cards as well

And lastly I have promo cards for all of the cards I have
mentioned and holograms as well  Not a lot though

I recently upgraded to a  and have found out I don't really have a need
for my old   I'd prefer to sell just the motherboard and keep the case
etc so I'll offer the motherboard and case separately and let you decide

I'm asking  for the motherboard which has
    Mhz  DX not SX
     megabytes of bit ns memory
    AMI BIOS
    based on CT NEAT chipset
    	this means the motherboard and bus circuitry timings are
	programmable  the BIOS' advanced configuration menus let you
	select system DMA bus clock wait states command delays etc
    baby AT sized  fits in minitower fullsized or most any other case
Includes User's Guide and a copy of the BIOS reference manual

For  more you could have the rest of the system too
    fullsize AT case with  watt power supply
     serial  parallel  game ports
    Mb hard disk
    Mb floppy disk
    keyboard
    video card choice of VGA or 

If you're interested please give me a call  The system is set up at my house
in Aloha and you're welcome to come test drive it

It's basement cleaning time  This stuff has got to go

I have two boxes of  track ' tapes around  tapesbox  They are
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up  They've seen
very little use  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship they're yours
for the cost of shipping the cod charge and a  nusiance fee

I have a lot of serial cables  I have all kinds ribbon shielded long
short MM MF whatever you want  Most appear to work well with PC serial
ports but I will not gaurantee that  Tell me what you want and I'll do
the best I can to match   ea or   Shipping included  No CODs
under   You want to pay a  COD charge for a  cable  Go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead it'll be cheaper  I believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center  They appear
to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well

I also have a  KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair probably
a logic board  It weighs about  pounds and is  inches high  I think
they used to run a Prime system off of it  Best offer over  but you 
need to come pick it up  Use this to run your house from your solar panels

I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff

 I'm looking for an old album or cassette tape The group is SanfordTownsend
the name of the album is 'Smoke from a Distant Fire' I think This album
came out somewhere around   and I believe was the first album produced
by Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke up

If you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it great If
you don't want to part with it but are willing to copy it onto cassette I'd
love that too

Thanks

 CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE 

I have  highend car amplifiers for sale

 OldStyle Rockford Fosgate 's  These are great amps and I've never
    had a minute's trouble with either of them  I've been running them on
    high end for quite some time frontrear and have been very pleased
    with them in that setup but I've also run them on low end before and
    they perform quite well in that situation as well  I'm trying to sell
    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford   I already
    own a Power  and I've always liked the way the  combo worked
    in cars

    I'm asking  a piece and list on them when I bought them was
      If you're interested in both of them I'd be willing to come
    down on the price a little bit


 Precision Power   This great utility amplifier is rated at x
    and looks brand new  The shroud is unscratched and it works great
    This is a great lowend amp because of it's highpower rating into
     channels however I've also had it running front or back high end
    before where it did very well

    I'm asking  for this amp but feel free to make me an offer on
    it

Ensoniq SQ CrossWave Synthesizer
I have an SQ for sale  The SQ is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited onboard sequencer  I bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire  it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more digital
Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual
  o Eightvoice polyphonic polytimbral synthesizer capable of
    playing eight different sounds at once with dynamic stereo
    panning for each voice
  o Voice section employing CrossWave synthesis  combine different
    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex dynamic sounds
  o  sampled waves includes a drumset serve as the sound source
  o Dynamic voice allocation  each sequencer trackMIDI channel has
    access to all eight voices
  o A fullfeatured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight
    MIDI program and volume changes at once  Keyboard is velocity
    sensitive and transmitsreceives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch
  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
    modulation sources and routings
  o A  floppy disk drive which writesreads ordinary DSDD disks
    allows fast and reliable storage of up to  sequences and up to
     sound patches on a single floppy disk  Also has a RAMcart slot
    for patches that is compatible with ESQ RAMcarts
  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device
  o  character fluorescent display and userfriendly pagedriven
    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
  o Stereo lineouts and stereo headphone jack for private listening
  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ
    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ can be played on
    the SQ

This SQ has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while
now  It has performed ably in that role and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time  The SQ seems to have been designed
with this role in mind and it works very well with my software sequencer
WinCake in its multitimbral mode

From a synthesis point of view this machine is a hybrid  It uses looped
short samples there are  of them as sources then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated DCFDCA arrangement  The SQ
is capable of great things because of its pole analog lowpass filter
Simply put it makes fabulous analog synth sounds  But unlike most
good analog synths it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it
works very well with a MIDI sequencer  What I really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds
This SQ is about  years old mfg date   It does have
an track sequencer but like most onboard sequencers it is a pain
to use so I have avoided it

REASON FOR SALE
I am selling my SQ because I recently joined forces with another individual
here in Boston and we have more keyboards than space to put them  I
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard

PRICING AND TERMS
I paid  for this synth a few years ago  I am willing to accept
 average rmms asking price is   I will include a bunch of 
patches on SQ floppy disks for the buyer of this synth as well as the 
original Ensoniq SQ owner's manual

Price    Asking  everything

HE IS A CROOK  DON'T DEAL WITH HIM

Please Help

I am looking for Dana Weick  A month ago I made a deal with him over the
net  I was to sell him some memory in exchang for  and a  cpu
I thought the deal was great so I went on with it  

I sent him the memory COD FOR   He was then suppose to send me the cpu
I receive his COD payment on   He send me a message the he sent the
cpu out   It has been two weeks and I didn't receive the CPU

I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship or
what address he send it to to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail
He never reply my mail  

I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona  The first call didn't get
throught I got  an answering machine  I left him my number  He didn't reply
I call again the next day and he pick up the phone  I asked him if he had
send out the cpu  He said yes but he doesn't know what address he sent it
to  

He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day
To my suprise He never called  I then send him some more email messages he
never reply again strang when the deal was being made he reply to every
of my message now that He got my memory He won't even reply to me

Now  I am still calling him but he won't pick up the phone  I am also still
      emailing him but he won't reply my mail

So if any one know this DANA WEICK please contact him
he can be reach at
			Dana Weick
			 W Las Palmaritas
			Phoenix AZ 
     in the day time this is his business number
     in the evenings this is his home number


his email address is
			weickmasterldsazloralcom
This is our deal

From weickmasterldsazloralcom Wed Mar   

 
 pin SIMMS aren't hot sellers I pick them up on the upgrade market for
  quite often  Best I can do is the DX and 
 
 

Ok you got a deal I'll trade you  pins SIMMs for an Intel DX AND
  I need you address for shippment I will ship it via COD and I 'll pay
shippinghandling  When the Simms arrive there will be a  charge on your
part  You can send the CPU to me via COD if possible

my address

By the way is the CPU under warranty

Great you can send the SIMMS to me at
Dana Weick
 W Las Palmaritas
Phoenix AZ  
  days   evenings

I would prefer US Mail nd Day Priority it only costs 

The CPU is brand new install it correctly meaning don't plug it in
backwards or bend any pins and I'll warranty it for  months
Thanks

ON  I SEND HIM AND SAID
that I got the cod payment
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
Is the CPU sent out yet
HE REPLIEDON 

Glad the COD payment got to you OK the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it  Be very careful when you install it be careful of static discharge
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation  The chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real
sympathetic 
 
If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed 
DON'T GUESS


DANA WEICK UPDATE

I call him sunday his wife Debbie picked up the phone  She said that he was 
busy with his kids and he would call me back in  minuets  Half an house
went by Weick didn't called  I called him again and his phone was discon
nected

Since this post  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA
WEICK have ripped them off  We got do something about this guy  He has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now  And he is getting away
with it

   I have a few the original IBM Mb harddisks for sale They are actually
Seagate's ST MFM full height  has the IBM logo and black face plate 
 
  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS  It can be doubled to 
Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and antistatic bags I am not sure if they were ever 
used but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order 
 
  each plus shipping cost about  
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs this is for you   It's cheaper
than a floppy drive

 nice to hear some good news once in a while
 
 This was nice of Kevin to post this  But just so no one is misled the
 VAST MAJORITY of usenetters are honest and good people  In fact in
 the latest study  of all netdeals went off smoothly without a
 hitch  It's just that the few bad ones are what get all the publicity

      Agreed  I have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net
      and I have bought things from CDs plenty to a full computer
      The only small problem that I have had was with UPS rather than
      the seller  Besides complaints are always what get the
      publicitywhen something goes wrong people complain  Rarely
      have I seen posts stating how well a deal went through  I guess
      Kevin is practically a first

                   I'd rather be swimming

   I have a few the original IBM Mb harddisks for sale They are actually
Seagate's ST MFM full height  has the IBM logo and black face plate 
 
  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS  It can be doubled to 
Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and antistatic bags I am not sure if they were ever 
used but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order 
 
  each plus shipping cost about  
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs this is for you   It's cheaper
than a floppy drive

I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs
a MIDIsound card Sound Blaster Pro is preferred to have its fantastic
features show up As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now I am 
putting it here for sale It's listed  on April issue of WINDOWS 
magazine and I paid  as the total I am asking around  with shipping
included

WinSong for Windows

Composer sequencer tape deck and Juke Box all in one

It's a word processor for music  you can write and edit cut paste move
and copy etc notes and symbols play and print your composition

It's graphical user interface works like a multitrack tape recorder
Up to  musical tracks can be arranged for play record rewind fastforward
and stop

It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument  piano guitar drum set
saxophone clarinet organ and many

You do not need to be a musician to use this software The online manual
is handy For musicians it's great as writing music is not a tedious and
stifling aspect

Almost NEW one week OLD unregistered
 including shipping OBO please be reasonable

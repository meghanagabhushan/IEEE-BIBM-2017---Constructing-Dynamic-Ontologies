I can't see why you would not trust it because it is safer than any previous
compression programs It integrates into the kernal and makes it nearly
impossible to delete 


I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom  was using  
I think but switched to  to see if it was any better  Vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  I can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about  inch  This is crazy  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be  just venting steam

I've seen this problem several times It was always the result of the little 
rollers inside the mouse becomming dirty they are good at collecting grime
the solution is simple remove the ball to reveal the two rollers 
Carefully clean them and the ball

I think you would need a DOS macro program  Superkey by Borland
comes to mind  I don't think Windows is capable of sending
keystrokes to a DOS window

What you want to do sounds like a security problem to me though

I have been posting monthly howtosetup a SLIP client on a PC posts for a 
few months  Lots of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of 
posting one of these for March or earlier this month  for which I apologize

This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota

PHONE

 begin SLIPTXT 
Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows  here
are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment  I thank the
Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments


Configuring your Modem

a Turn off DTR ATDW
   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use
   to dial my SLIP server QMODEM drops DTR when I exit the program
   and therefore hangs up the line  If you use a program like Kermit
   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection then this need not be done
   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit

   NOTE If you use Univ of Minn PHONE to dial and establish a
         SLIP connection you do not need to turn off DTR

b Dial and establish the SLIP connection first  This can be done
   automatically if you use a program like PHONE from the University of
   Minnesota which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the
   SLIP packet driver  The PHONE scripting language is simple and
   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with
   other SLIP server  In addition while the only packet driver
   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP currently it is easy to write a
   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers
   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and
   batch file examples


Configuring the SLIP drivers

There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available
CSLIPPEREXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver
SLIPPEREXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver
SLIPCOM    Crynwr driver I like Phil Burn's modified driver
ETHERSLCOM     Crynwr driver ethernet simulation over SLIP
UMSLIPCOM      Univ of Minnesota driver based on SLIP

Of these four I vastly prefer CSLIPPEREXE over SLIPCOM or
ETHERSLCOM for the following reasons

a It is much faster even though my modem has just a  UART
b While using EtherSLIPSLIPUMSLIP myself and several others
   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a
   long FTP transfer
c It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode
d When used in Ethernet simulation mode CSLIPPER seem to work with
   every TCPIP application that I have tested it with

Instructions for CSLIPPEREXE and you do not use PHONE
a Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXECBAT file according to instructions
   For instance if you have a vbis modem on COM
   slipper com vec baud
b If you use DOS TCPIP applications in Win  DOS boxes then use the
   doubleended packet driver shim WinPKTCOM  this creates a virtual
   packet driver at x  DOS applications in native mode DOS
   applications in Windows  DOS boxes and Windows applications can all
   use this virtual driver at x
   winpktcom x x
c If you use QVTNet load PKTINTCOM next  QVTnet is configured in
   QVTNETINI to use the interrupt at x
   pktintcom

Instructions for SLIPCOM
a Try getting a version  SLIP driver  Philip Burns of Northwestern
   University has a modified SLIPCOM driver that is better at hardware
   handshaking  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP
b Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection  My modem is a
   Vbis modem on COM so here is how I would load the driver
   slip w x h  SLIP xf 
c As discussed above if you use DOS TCPIP applications in Windows x
   DOS boxes you probably want to use WINPKTCOM
   winpktcom x x
d If you use WinQVTnet load PKTINTCOM
   pktintcom

Instructions for ETHERSLCOM
If you choose to use ETHERSLCOM instead of SLIPCOM the
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference  You
will have to DELETE the line devicevcd from the Enh section
of SYSTEMINI  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm
applications such as Crosstalk and you will get lots of dropped
characters etc in these applications  This is therefore not
recommended  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as
   ethersl w x h  xf 

Configuring Windows 

a Make the following modifications to the SYSTEMINI file Enh
   section
   i List all your COM ports with their addresses and interrupts
       COMBaseF
       COMIrq
       COMBaseF
       COMIrq
       COMBaseE
       COMIrq
       This can also be done from within Windows  Control Panel
       but doubleclicking on the Ports icon
   ii Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer
       COMBuffer
   iii Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish
       to use for your modem to ZERO  This is the amount of time that
       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to
       another application  If you use WinQVTnet and then want to switch
       from one session to another and this value is at the default value
       of  seconds you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash
       COMAutoAssign
       This can also be done from within Windows  Control Panel
       Doubleclick on  Enhanced and under Device Contention set
       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to
       Never Warn

Additional notes

What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each
SLIP session

I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user
a permanent IP address so I do not have worry about editing QVTNETINI
each time that I establish a SLIP connection

If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in
please try to use BOOTP aware software and let BOOTP do the
configuration for you  However QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP
will not work over a SLIP connection  To get QVTNet working in a
situation such as this you must do the following

Edit the QVTNETINI file  Let the net section look like this

net
name
ip
netmask or whatever is appropriate for you
arptime
packetvector or whatever is appropriate

Save the changes and then writeprotect this file
attrib r qvtnetini

Start your slip connection and remember the name and IP address
that you are assigned  Each time you start QVTnet x the
general configuration dialog box will open  Enter the name and
IP address and you were assigned for that session click on OK
and you should be up and running  The changes you make will not
be saved as QVTNETINI is writeprotected

A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address
assignment is provided by Victor Menayang victorccwfccutexasedu
Victor uses the program bootpq to semiautomate qvtnet preparation
Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP which is then saved to a
file called myip  Another file noip is essentially a complete
QVTNETINI file that lacks the IP address  In the final step myip
and noip are copied into a single QVTNETINI file  An example of
Victor's batch file is provided below

slipper com
pktintcom
bootpq i ips   myip
bootpq i My IP is s
copy q net  myip  noip ecomqvtnetqvtnetini
del q myip
echo off
echo 
echo Ready to run WinQVTnet

For questions and more details about bootpq please contact Victor
Menayang victorccwfccutexasedu

QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVTnet

How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP

PKTMUX will not work over the SLIPCOM packet driver and crashes
immediately if used with ETHERSLCOM

PKTMUX will work with CSLIPPEREXE when CSLIPPER is used in ethernet
simulation mode  An example of this configuration is shown below

The latest release of PKTMUX is c and it is important that you
use this version if you want to use virtual packet drivers with
applications like Trumpet for Windows to be released very shortly

from AUTOEXECBAT

lh cslipper com vec baud ether         packet driver
lh pktmux          pktmux loaded for  virtual packet drivers
lh pktdrv f          first virtual packet driver used for QVTnet
lh pktintcom           QVTnet pktintcom
pktdrv              PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet

Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within
Windows  DOS boxes  For example my PIF file to load POPmail is
directed to the file popmailbat  This is what popmailbat reads
like

pktdrv              loads a virtual packet driver at x
cd popmail
popmail
cd 
pktdrv  u            unloads the packet driver at x
exit                    causes the DOS window to close

I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCPIP applications
like PC Gopher  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS
sessions are loaded at the same software interrupt  For example
within two different DOS boxes  one for POPmail and the other for
Gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at x in each
instance

How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of CSLIPPER

I have a VbisVbis modem in a  running Windows  with
a reasonably fast video card ATI Graphics Ultra  Under these
conditions when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and
being used as follows
a Driver at xf  QVTNet FTP client session
b Driver at x in one DOS Window  CUTCP tn session
c Driver at x in another DOS Window  Trumpet for DOS

I get FTP transfer rates of    kbsec while transferring
compressed files  This rate is comparable to that which I get with
SLIP loaded as a packet driver and where a single TCPIP session
is active  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session
is active I get transfer rates of    kbsec on the same
files

While there is about  degradation in the performance of SLIPPER
for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the
performance hit

CSLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode

In ethernet simulation mode CSLIPPER ver  works with all the
applications that I have tested it with  One or two applications
that required ethernet simulation balked at CSLIPPER  but even
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 

When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode and used with PKTMUX
I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads
IPincorrect packet type or IPbad version number  This does not
seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning although I cannot comment on
loss of performance

What can you do if your DOS TCPIP application does not work with
CSLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode

In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with
CSLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author 
Peter Tattam  PETERpsychnetpsycholutaseduau and let him
know  Chances are that he can fix it

In the meanwhile you can try the following  I do not know if it is
kosher but it worked when I had problems with CSLIPPER ver 

CSLIPPER is loaded at x as described above under the PKTMUX section

I load ETHERSLCOM at x run the application and then terminate
ETHERSLCOM

This also works within Windows  virtual DOS boxes  However a
packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box
at a time

So for example here is my batch file to run Grateful Med a
medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library
of Medicine

ethersl w x h  xf        loads ETHERSLIP
cd gm
search
cd 
termin x                             terminates ETHERSLIP
exit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows

If you use this method be cautious about one thing  don't have
any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time  After closing
the ETHERSL window you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no
problem  BTW the example above  Grateful Med works with no
problems with CSLIPPER ver 

How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE

The quick answer  there is no clean way  Below is a batch file
hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers  In this
example the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER  To use a
batch file like this you must know the parameters with which you
plan to use the packet driver  ie interrupt vector baud rate
port address and IRQ  This batch file requires UMSLIPCOM
CSLIPPEREXE and TERMINCOM to be in the same directory
or in your path 

All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection
using PHONE load the appropriate packet driver hangup the
connection and unload the driver when you are done

echo off

rem   awaiting a version of CSLIPPER that can directly interact

        I am having something very unusual happen  First 
some background on my system  I have a Mitsubishi  meg Hard Drive 
and am running Smartdrv the version that comes with Windows  on 
it  I rarely use Windows  I use a program called Disk Technician 
Gold v to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive  It works by 
having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is 
necessary for a file or if there is anything else is wrong with it 
and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting  My hard 
drive is notorious for bad sectors  I usually end up with  new bad 
sectors a week
 
        Here's what happened  I ran a program and DTG broke in with 
an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot  It gave me this 
message twice before the program was fully loaded  I exited the program 
and did just this  DTG went through its bootup process examining 
for new errors etc and a screen popped up and said something about 
sectors for a brief period of time
 
        I then went back to the program executed it again and the 
exact same error was detected  I rebooted and tried again and the 
same error happened again  So I removed DTG from memory and went 
to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong  Sure enough 
there was a number of read attempts  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG 
but removed the cache  I executed the program  No read errors 
either audible or detected by DTG  I quit the program loaded the 
cache and ran the program again  The errors were detected
 
        Ok so the errors are there and DTG detects but doesn't fix 
them when the cache is loaded  When the cache is not loaded there are 
no errors  So to see if the cache was interfering with any other 
files I went into xtree gold and tagged all files and searched them 
for a random string in other words I wanted the program to 
completely read every file on my hard drive  Before I got through 
the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot
 
        Does anybody have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on 
my hard drive  Oh there are exactly two misreads per file and  in 
about every  files are affected  
 
        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp's 
system but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about 
smartdrv to help me out

It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important

If someone made a voice recognitionmultimedia sound oriented program
it would probably been more effective  I don't know what the original
purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question
though

Why is Win  sometimes so finicky
I have a new DELL DXmhz   megs RAM
Windows was working just great  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem
DELL replaced the mouse gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard  Just prior to this problem windows would
only load up every other time  I would get the LOGO and either it would
go on into windows or LOCK UP  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME

Now with the new motherboard and all it still does the same thing
The computer is less than one month old  At first it worked FINE
I can get into windows each time now with the   wins command
This forces Standard mode  Things seem to run slower  I mainly
use windows apps but in standard mode there is no virtual mem
plus it is slower

I reloaded windows it still does the same thing  Should I first delete
everything in all windows dir's  I did not because I have so much 
added in sub dir's etc

Really puzzling why ENHANCED MODE would not load each time but consistently
every other time  Standard mode each time

ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS

Subject Why I'm not using Dos  anymore
Lines 

I've been running Dos  for about a month  I was generally impressed with
the improvements  the multiple boot configurations were great the
new commands were nice and DoubleSpace worked fine twice as slow for
large data transfers twice as fast for small with SmartDrv

Until now

This morning at  am while I was working on my research paper I had to
reboot a hung Dos program that did no disk io from within Windows 
When my machine finished rebooting I found my windows directory and about two
thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted

I cannot afford problems like this  I'm returning to Dos 

mark

PS  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should
      exist

Hello

I just recently bought a NEC FG  In order to get the highest possible quality
and refresh rates I'd like to know if there are any accelerator cards with
BNC connectors as opposed to the usual dsub connector 

I do not know of any VGA type cards that have BNC outputs but EXTRON
sells a VGA to BNC cable set that works good with my FG  If you are
trying to optimize the display with a good video card try contacting 
 getnine  I use and like the level  card

Thanks for any information

Word c doesn't show the periodcentred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box  They overlap each other and
characters on each side which is useless

I believe the character used by WW is the periodcentred 
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or WW
Altering the paragraph  or cedilla  does alter their font
graphics displayed however

Is the WW character used to indicate spaces the periodcentred character 

Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF

 Well this is only a guess  If it goes by the true meaning of bit
 map then it holds xyc where x pixel number in th exdirection y
 pixelnumber in the ydir c colour

Come on fellows The format is quite plainly explained in the manuals
It's in the Programmer's Reference Volume  Messages Structures
and Macros MSCDevkit for  should be also in the Borland's
manuals pages  depending what you need

First there is the BITMAPFILEHEADERstruct then the BITMAPINFO which
contains the BITMAPINFOHEADER and the RGBQUAD and then the bitmap
data AND there is also a example among the example files MSSDK
Hope this helps

Hello again

About a week and onehalf ago I posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers  Specifically a comparison between the
Canon BJ BubbleJet and the HewlettPackard DeskJet   Many people
asked me to post the summaryaccount of all the postings and email I
received  Below is my original query and the responses I received  I have
not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so
you can extract what you find necessary  Some people asked me for an
unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer  There are a
wide range of comments each has its own value  

There was no clear winner some like the BJ especially its
priceperformance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability
of the DeskJet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new
printer to be introduced by HewlettPackard later this year around
summertime and an addition to the Epson product line their first
inkjet  You will find that after the initial purchase the costs of
refilling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely
depends on where you purchase the refills or replacements  so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer  No one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print but I suspect they are roughly equal at about    sheets
laser printers will do  sheets per toner cartridge  Well
that's a brief research summary of my personal research  ENJOY



Hello fellow 'netters

I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I
should purchase the Canon BJ BubbleJet vs the HP DeskJet   I
thought rather than trust the salesperson I would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential  And I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson

Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 
dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs the HewlettPackard DeskJet   dpi
Which is faster  Is there a noticeable print quality difference
particularly in graphics  Which will handle large documents better 
pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here  Which works better under Windows  any driver problems etc
Cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  Basically your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable
both good and bad


Well I bought the BJ  about a month ago at the start of their  rebate
program on that printer it ends  and I bought it from Computer
Discount Warehouse because their price of  couldn't be beat anywhere I
looked and I think it's a HOT printer  Just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode  I compared the
output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with pt type done on my
BJ  with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed
how well I could read the small print on the BJ   Printing speed was
several seconds faster on the BJ  which is amazing considering that the
HP has M ram installed  I measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data as I used print manager in Windows

I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders
too  If you need CDW's phone number it's   Delivery to NY
was two days

Good luck

I own a Deskjet  Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using
TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen Quality for
the HP is very much dependent on paper quality  on 'standard' photocopy
paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality
'distinction' type paper things look better For most applications I find
copy paper fine  still better than dotmatrix  Comes with a Windows
driver which seems to bypass print manager has a few
'intellifonts'which are HP scaleable fonts  probably faster than TrueType
but haven't really tried them out Can get RAM  FONT cartridges but unless
the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother The RAM cartridges
can't be used as buffer  soft fonts only

For graphics ie BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via
the HP supplied Win driver There a number of dither options such as
'scatter' 'pattern' etc  The manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed  Text is not so good in this mode Problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text  The
range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general

From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects

However a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
Epson  This printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing
laserlike quality on normal copier paper  Can't remember the model  LX
 something I think

I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here   The
introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand
 


About a month ago I got a Canon BJ  I absolutely LOVE it  It is
incredibly fast except for printing from PSPICE I don't know if you ever
do stuff with that or not  Most of the stuff I print is either from
Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text  The only problems I've had
are printing headersfooters the printer freaked out and printing on
cheap paper lots of streaks  Normal copy paper works great with it you
can only tell it's not laserprinted by holding it oh less than twelve
inches from your face  That is if you're nearsighted like me   The
printer comes with its own driver for Windows   I have no other
complaints  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for
those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet
The teenyweeny footprint is a real plus tooAND if you purchase it
between now and May  you get a  rebate from Canon  I bought mine
from a store called CompUSA and the price now is   I have a friend
who has the HP you are looking at  It also prints very well and everyone
has drivers for it BUT it is VERY slow

Hope I helped

dpi sure looks great

  I guess I have some experience with both I have a BJ at work and a
Deskjet  at home  I prefer the Deskjet  The printing speed and quality
are similar I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet
for home  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM
Proprinter to get it to work with many nonwindows apps and this will be
the case for a long time  The design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper the Deskjet is quieter AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs

  Yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not
present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the
translation  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the
note  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately inch around
the paper the Bubblejet does not  You are right about the graphics
resolutions I tested the printers with the applications I had access to
Wordperfect Harvard Graphics WinGIF Paintshop PRO and Paintbrush and
could not tell a difference  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down  The Bubblejet did not
I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no
comparision there  Finally I wanted sheet feeding  In that configuration
the Bubblejet cost approximately  more than the Deskjet

I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I
spent my own money  BTW I am replacing the BJ with a Deskjet  at
work this month anyway

I spent some time comparing the two  We ended up getting the Bubblejet
BJ versus the HP  Our reasons were

 The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon
 dpi versus   we felt we could see the difference
 Price  Canon has a  rebate program going on at the moment

The BJ was our choice over the BJex  we could have  pages in the
BJ feeder  The BJex holds only  pages I think

As you can see up to  pages on the BJ  We haven't done anything
big with the BJ but its performance seems reasonable under Windows  I
know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the
printer but I don't know how it compares also the driver included with
the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one
comes from  Microsoft

Hope this helps

Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson if I'm not suppost to study 
I would recommend to buy the BJ The printing quality is a bit better
but you you've got much more possiblities Don't forget the HP engine is at
least  years on the marked the Canon engine witch is also used in
other new bubblejet printers like eg the Epson ones is quite recently
available

 Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 
 dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs the HewlettPackard DeskJet   dpi
 Which is faster  Is there a noticeable print quality difference
 particularly in graphics  Which will handle large documents better 

I've seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me
Canon printers  times the same picture one printed with the BJ one
with the Canon the other with the HP and there was a difference in
printing quality The Canon was a bit better

When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to
inkjet printers  They have near laser quality speed and they are quiet
We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJs  I prefer the paper handling
qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print
quality  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder however I did end
up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal  Anyway we are
using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well  Out
of  Deskjets and  BJs I have only had one problem with a deskjet and
that was taken care of very quickly by HP

Whenever I buy anything I look at what the experts say pick out the top
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt  I've been
unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so I've done this a
few times including  about four months ago  with inkjet printers

I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three
reviews of inkjets and that the  was always at or near the top  I
bought the C because of the added dimension of colour I intend to build
a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner
towards that  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I
tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the
result

I note that even though you can now get the C the one with both colour
and mono with no need to change the cartridge the C and  are still
readily available at least in the UK  The following are my
viewsexperience

		I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away
		from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with
		the idea that the HP offered the best performanceprice ratio

		I believe HP are the originals in the field  not always the
		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes
		they have the expertise

		The C is worth the extra  Operation in mono is perfectly
		acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from
		Windows

		I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured
		typesetters before their AMERICAN owners closed them down
		and I can tell you that in terms of definition  dpi is
		pretty poor anyway so  dpi is just a bit less poor

		The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers

		If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack  it's pretty
		slow with it God knows what it's like without

I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily
use  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and
having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate

Hope this is of use

Regards

Just bought the BJ  I thought the price couldn't be beat  with
 rebate thru  and so far it is comparable even superior to the
DeskJet in print quality

Speed   Per page rate seems to be faster I don't have figures
         I don't print long docs though

Quality I think the graphics quality is excellent  Print quality is
         excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up
         close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a LaserJet
         The  dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the
         pageprint head in place I would imagine

Large docs  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages 
         manual says up to  though  Haven't tried it

Drivers  No problems under Win yet  WinWord doesn't want to print
         the envelopes the same way the Canon does though

Know nothing of addon costs

 Daniel A Hartung    dhartungchinetchinetcom    Ask me about Rotaract



The deskjet is SLOW  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares

The interface between Win and the printer is just dandy I've not
had any problems with it

I just bought a BJ printer a couple of days ago  I compared it to the
sample print of an HP DeskJet  and knew that the HP wasn't for me  The
BJ is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  I can compare
it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical 
depending on the kind of paper  I don't have problems with the ink not
being dry it seems to dry VERY fast  Probably within a second  Since
Canon is giving a  rebate until the end of May it is really a good buy

Wow it's funny you should ask this  I'm a little behind in news reading
so I know this may be late

  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night  I was really worried
that I wouldn't like it but the print quality and noise level is
fantastic  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it
printed DAMN near laser quality  You can't tell it's not laser unless you

  no problems with drivers  The printer came with the driver diskette
which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it
under Windows or WordPerfect  It works well under both  I have yet to
install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them

  I had a DeskJet  at work last year  It was a good printer as well ut
I felt it was awfully slow  And much noisier than the BubbleJet  I won't
say the BubbleJet is MUCH better but I really do like it more  Just my

Subject Question on EISA video board performance

I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most
EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA
counterparts For instance the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIsE is
only about as fast as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus which isn't
what I would call fast

I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't as a group on the
same level of performance as Local Bus cards given that EISA video
cards have a  bit bus to move data around instead of ISA's  bits

Since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher
cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than
and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board such as a
Diamond SpeedStar X From PC Magazine's I think recent report
I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card but it's
around  which is just about double what my wallet will allow
me to spend And for  I could get a Diamond Viper and still
have  left over of course I'd have to get a Local Bus mother
board too

Can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration

Thanks   Christopher Wroten cfwworldstdcom

Yep you can use any type of UNIX or maybe VMS or buy a MAC or something
  If you want longer filenames for your documents I heard of a wordprocessor for
windows which let you assign long names to files Those long filenames could only be
seen from that programs opensave dialogs though Maybe someone knows more about
this wordprocessor than I do

Why is Win  sometimes so finicky
I have a new DELL DXmhz   megs RAM
Windows was working just great  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem
DELL replaced the mouse gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard  Just prior to this problem windows would
only load up every other time  I would get the LOGO and either it would
go on into windows or LOCK UP  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME

much deleted
ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS 

Sounds like a memory conflict problem which can cause truly weird symptoms 
like these Call Dell tech support or better post to them on CSERVE if you
have an account and get the memory ranges used by video RAM on your
machine The block windows from using those ranges with an
EMMEXCLUDE statement in the Enh section of SYSTEMINI You probably
should include a statement excluding the same range from EMM or whatever
memory manager you use in CONFIGSYS

Dell installs Windows on the machines they ship but the installation doesn't
consist of much more than  copying the files to a hard disk You still have
to do the work And the fact that you have the problem in Enhanced
mode but not standard strongly suggests a high memory conflict

Title says it all I'm in need of a Truetype OEM character set font  ie
one that contains the line drawing and other characters in the PC 
character set similar to those you get when running a text mode application

If anyone could point me at such a thing I'd be grateful

The only OEM fonts included with Windows are not Truetype

 Hello
 
 	Who can tell me   Where can I find the PD or ShareWare   
 Which can CAPTURE windows 's output of printer mananger
 
 	I want to capture the output of HP Laser Jet III
 
 	Though the PostScript can setup to print to filebut HP can't
 
 	I try DOS's redirect programbut they can't work in Windows 
 
 		Thankx for any help
 

You CAN print to a file from an HP or any other printer  Just go into
the Printers section of your Control Panel  Select the printer you want
to redirect to a file and click on Connect  Then choose FILE as the
port to connect the printer to

When you print from any application to that printer Windows will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the
printout

It's pretty easy

Good luck

Hi everybody out there
I just got the third beta release disk march  of WindowsNT
and still am not able to boot up that system The final step
achieved is the display of IOerror x But since this is
the beta release of the SDK for NT and not of NT Microsoft does
not include a manual on the OS itself explaining what this
error means of what I can do to get rid of My configuration
is 
Mainboard     Hauppauge  rev A a  with socket for i
              megs of memory kMM

              STN hard disk

ProAudio Spectrum Plus 
Longshine Ethernet card LCS NE comp
ET graphics card Meg ColorImage
The system is running fine under DOS and Windows  etc but
trying to do the setup for NT
 automatic setup does not recognize controller AHAcompat
  when adding manually NT complains not finging any CDROM drive
 the manual setup WINNT does not copy everything from CD to HD
  does not recognize controller but takes it manually
  Setup continues until it tries to boot Then it starts loading
  several stuff from disk seems to fing the HD but messing up
  with that damned IOError 
I took away all IO cards not essential but that did not make any
effect
Anybody got any ideas Help would be greatly appreciated

I've been running Dos  for about a month  I was generally impressed with

PS  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should

InfoWorld April   issue has two articles about problems with DOS
  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it  The point out
that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a
number of folks problems

MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
that they could duplicate probably are not trying too hard

Cringely reports that a lot of folks are gettinggoing to get burned
on the  support lines  his example was a call that cost

 reboot a hung Dos program that did no disk io from within Windows 
 When my machine finished rebooting I found my windows directory and about two
 thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted
 
stuff deleted

This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago My HD was stacked
with Stacker v I run Dos Suddenly everything hung up and most of
the HD got corrupted directories changed into unreadable files with
'funny' names In other words it is probably just the doubledisk part of
Dos that is troublesome 

I now use Stacker v  and so far I have had no trouble 

This pretty much confirms my original impression after reading
through the documentation on dos  The double space sounds nice
but NOT on your primary disk  I'll probably wind up making a
disk partition d and doublespacing it using it as an archive
Probably would be useful on floppy disks as well  But on c  Uh uh

I particularly disliked the note that said something like double
space is irreversible

I recently set Windows  up on my DX VLB system and I didn't
notice until last night that I don't have the  icon in my control
panel  I don't remember Windows setup asking me about  enhanced
mode whether I wanted it or not  Now I've got a program that I 
just bought Aldus Freehand  that is telling me that I should be
running Windows in enhanced mode looks like I'm running in standard
mode

How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie  Are
there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows
to not want to give you enhanced mode 

Thanks for any help

  Origin chrisdoellefnzfidonetorg 

 I thought I'd reply to this though I ain't brad  AT any case a lot
of picturefile viewers that will convert say between gifetc to
bmp will convert to rle  I Know for a fact that PaintShop
shareware from cica desktop I think filename psVVVzip I think
where VVV is the ver number  If that's not true let me know and Ill
post a corection


This however will write your rle file with a bmp extension so you
have to rename it

NOW another thing
this is from the windows' FAQ

your file has to be less than  K
 at least that's what the faq says but Mine wont work for more than
about maybe they mend K I don't know

Your file has to fit VGA size    or whatever standard vga size
is  If you use a nonvga screen eg Cga ega svga there is also a
way to do it but I thing instead of vgalogolgo you use another file
such as cgalogolgo egalogolgo or something  I'm not sure about
this as I have a vga but i'm sure you could find it in the faq a
windows help ver of which is available at cica but don't konw the
filename 

ALSOyour bmp has to be  COLOURS Or less

These specs rule out some of the good bmp's  I found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory

Finally REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WINCOM before and put your
new wincom in the windows directory  Also don't start windows from a
directory where another wincom is present as that is used instead of
the one in the windows dir and win won't start


Share this fairly but don't take a slice of my pie PF

We are using pkzip V and I am interested to hear from

Well I got  WINZIP from cica don't know which version but I think
it's the latest as this is not long ago and I was initially imressed
But here's the lowdown

WINZIP is a great progra as long as you only unzip  It lets you
vew files unzip only selected files and even puts the files in a
checkout directory and creates a checkout grp and group if you want
to check the program out  It even prompts for deletion of these on
exit if you didnt like the program

HOWEVER big however over here  I have problems zipping  I don't
konw specifics on this or ammount of consistency but sometimes when I
zip a few files or add a file to a zip dos will violate something
or other and I'll be asked in a kind microoft kind of way to quit
all applications quit windows and restart my computer  I don't know
as I said how consistent this is as I jdont' zip much and when I do
now I just go to dos and use it from there or just use the run cmd
but I do know it's happened when I added files to an existing zip
file and when I created a new zip file using selected files only
I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir

Still it has a rather nice interface and quite useful unziping
functions  If the above is fixed I'll be the first to register the new
ver  as for now a good old rununzip zip will work

PS if a new ver is out that fixes these please let me know

  Origin chrisdoellefnzfidonetorg 

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm but I've used the
shareware program PaintShop to convert between the two  You can download
it from ftpcicaindianaedu but I don't know what the file is called
or what directory it is in you can start by looking in pubpcwin or try
scanning the index files

To convert a BMP file to a RLE file you just load the BMP file and do a
Save as  Select Windows bitmap and Compressed or is it RLE
Whatever it is it's fairly intuitive

Sorry I don't have all the details but I'm currently on an IBM dumb
terminal and can't do much researchingGood luck

    This may be an FAQ if so please direct me to the known answer but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help

    I am running Win  with NDW  on a sx with  meg of memory and a
     meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them

    When I load windows I start with about  resources available but many
    of the application programs I run regularly WPWIN  VB  WINQVT
     Lotus Organizer etc seem to not return all their resources when
    I exit them  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under
     of available resources even when I have no applications other than
    my shell running

    I am aware this is a known problem what I am looking for are some
    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it  

     What software is the culprit  Win  NDW my applications  Are
    some modes of Win  standard real enhanced better than others at
    plugging this leak

     Are their systemini switches i can set to help plug this leak

     Do people know of patches or third party software that help with
    this  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM

     If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside  I was
    hoping that NDW  would have plugged this but it seems no different
    than  in how it deals with memory and resources

     When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less
    likely my code will eat resources

     Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for
    specifically

    Thanks for your help  As this is a common problem and I have seen only
    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
    me email

MessageID bdfeddohstpympsohiostateedu

I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows
from a Novell administrator's point of view
 
I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they
Microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support
the LOCAL setup described below as the most advantageous installation
If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first
 
The LOCAL Windows Installation

Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the
resources are available  From a network administrator's implementation
heshe would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUPA
Then install windows on a permachine bases by running SETUP off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives  In this way all drivers
are available to the SETUP procedure wo the need to change disks
 
Advantages
 Reduce Traffic  Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to
  the local access of main Windows files
 Network independence  If the network fails and they all do at one point
  or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing
  and reduce the cost of downtime
 Faster Windows  Theoretically Windows will run faster from a local hard
  drive than over a network  This may be a hard point to prove if the network
  has an optical backbone andor the network drives are significantly faster
  access than local ones
 A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about
  varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc since the
  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation
 
Disadvantages
 Cost  Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk
  space  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can
  increase the cost of the workstation from  to  percent
 Administration  Local windows installations are very difficult to
administer
  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of
  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation
 Security  Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system
  files from simple ignorance  This could result in quite a headache for
  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations
 Backup  We all know the problems backing up local hard disks  The backup
  sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly
  Backup individually to floppy may not happen at all  This may be
  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable
  applications and not user data
 
The SHARED Windows Installation

Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUPA procedure
described above  Users or administrators then install a minimal set of
files to individual user directories  These directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory  The bulk of the
Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory
some  files and are accessed shared asneeded by users throughout
their Windows session  The user's files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during hisher Windows session  These include
group files INI files and other regularly updated files
 
Advantages
 A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy  As
  an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this
  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it
 Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network home directories
  the administrator can easily edit any INI file asneeded to correct
  problems that may arise  This includes WININI and SYSTEMINI
 Backup of all pertinent files is done easily  Even if the users' files
  are on a local hard disk the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with
  all driver updates
 
Disadvantages
 Network traffic  since all Windows files are being shared in a network
  directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the
  speed of Windows
 If the network crashes all production comes to a stop since Window's
  is reliant upon the network for its files  Loss of data usually occurs
  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will
  usually not be able to save their work
 Although minimal disk space is still a consideration  If the users' files
  are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a
  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows
  files alone
 Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation
  hardware are similar  This is due to the Windows installation being
  tied to a particular username in the case of Network user files
  
The Discussion

I would like to know from other administrators with a large Windows
userbase how they prefer setting up Windows  Personally I have
setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup  All Windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks  In fact I sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money
 
I would also like to see recommendations for applications  Should
apps such as Word andor Excel be installed locally regardless of how
Windows is installed  Again I keep all files on the network for easy

Now I am sure Microsoft and I know your out there has their own

hear from people with actual working experience with users and network

Subject TCPIP through Windows 
Lines 

I don't know much about computers so please bear with me Here's my question

CONTEXT I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the
         university mainframe an IBM  running VMSMVS and log on to my
         account When I installed SLIP on my computer I had to configure it
         for my modem  kbs Etronics internal and had to supply the phone
         number to dial to reach the mainframe The way it works now is that
         I type telnet uicvm or tn uicvm either will work at the DOS
         prompt UICVM is the node name of the mainframe The program then
         dials the mainframe establishes a protocol and gives me the logon
         screen TELNET and TN are the names of batch files in my SLIP
         directory I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the
         session

PROBLEM I would like to be able to do all this under Windows  because I
         hardly ever use DOS directly SLIP will not run under Windows I
         talked to the people at our computer center and they suggested that
         I use a packet driver called WINPKTCOM with SLIP They gave me
         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows and how to
         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files in the SLIP directory
         to ensure that it would work I did all that and I could run SLIP
         from Windows but there were other problems For one thing SLIP
         would not hang up the phone when I exited I had to run my communi
         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when
         that didn't work For another there were too many errors It often
         took me  tries to connect to the mainframe Our computer center
         does not support SLIP under Windows so I can't keep going back to
         them with more questions

QUESTION Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows
         and do what SLIP is supposed to do I need a package that is not too
         expensive which is why I am looking for shareware I have heard that
         there are regular commercial packages that do all this but they cost
         hundreds of dollars These are the main requirements

          Must be able to run under Windows 
          Must allow VT and IBM TN terminal emulation
          Must allow ftp file transfers since that's the only kind the
            mainframe allows No Ymodem or Zmodem etc I believe the ftp
            transfers are made through a kermit protocol but I'm hazy about
            that

         A subsidiary feature that would be nice to have if it's a true
         Windows program rather than a DOS program modified to run under
         Windows is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently
         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet
         session and other applications

Any information received is appreciated

Yes Russ there is 
QuinZip is a Windows version but I don't think it handles
all the functions available in the DOS version

Last I looked QuinZip could be found on the Monash University Australia

I thought the files that controlled this were

I restored these files but it didn't change the logo  Anyone know what
the correct files are

I believe you have the correct files I think what you'll have to
do is go back into Setup and choose change video adapter or
whatever it is called Then the trick is choose the same adaptor
you currently have What Setup does is it actually changes the
file WINCOM whenever you go into it and change the video
hardware selection It incorporates the contents of VGALOGORLE
into WINCOM when you do this This trick can also be used to
change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be

Has anyone observed this  If I copy a large say K file a large PKZIP
file for instance to my floppy drive  under MS Windows  via either
Program Manager or a DOS Shell the file copied under the DOS shell 
has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not

The corruption is detected by executing pkunzip t bfilezip after 
both copies  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption


Now here's the kicker


I have many windows open while doing this both DOS and WINDOWs apps
Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice whereas the 
DOS apps get their own equal time slice unless overriden


So as an example I have  WINDOWs' apps open  multitasking DOS sessions running
and one executionexeclusive DOS shell iconized inactive  Under this 
scenario CPU time is divided into two major slices  one for all the Windows
apps and one slice for the running DOS app  

When copying under Windows PGM MGR I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks
are essentially inactive  Thus PGM MGR gets say  of the Windows slice and
 of the executionbackground DOS shell's slices  Thus it gets   
 or  of the total available CPU time 

When copying in a DOS shell I activate the executeexclusive mode DOS shell
no other DOS background tasks allowed full screen under the Windows task
manager  The CPU time available to this shell would be  of the Windows slice
assumming inactive Windows applications and  of the DOS slice 
   or  of the total available CPU time

So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU
time  Is program manager working in a preemptive mode during the floppy 
copy  It must be

Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane

I have a problem with my  when running windows that appears
to be memoryrelated  It's actually not limited to windows but
that's where it causes most of my problems  Ths machine's DX
Meg RAM Kcache TRIDENT TVGA card PAS soundcard

  Windows runs REALLY REALLY slow most of the time  Slower than
on my old SX  Graphics drawsfills are slow boots are slow
applications are sluggish dialog boxes take up to  seconds to appear
Note some of my other nonwindows applications do funny things that
appear to be related  Several run slow my mod player crashes the
system etc

 Running Borland C  before running windows or any of the other
programs  COMPLETELY fixes the problem  Windows will run as fast as
I've ever seen it run easily  times faster for graphics than
when I don't run BC beforehand

  I don't have a memory manager installed in configsys  Installing
emmexe does not fix the problem it makes it worse  After emm is
installed running BC will not fix the problem anymore

This problem is driving me nuts  If you think you can help
please reply through the mail

Do you mean a prog that doesn't jump to the DOS display and then back or 
create a temp DOS window

If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftpcicaindianaedu  I'm afraid 
I don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it

It's fully compatible with ver g and very functional

    This may be an FAQ if so please direct me to the known answer but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help

    I am running Win  with NDW  on a sx with  meg of memory and a
     meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them

    I am aware this is a known problem what I am looking for are some
    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it  

     What software is the culprit  Win  NDW my applications  Are
    some modes of Win  standard real enhanced better than others at
    plugging this leak

It's the applications that do this  Unfortunately even the applets
that ship with Win seem to have this problem I've seen it in
Solitaire for example  

     Are their systemini switches i can set to help plug this leak

None that I know of  If an application doesn't give back the
resources they are lost and gone forever pending a restart of
Windows 

     Do people know of patches or third party software that help with
    this  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM

If the applications don't free up the memory and a lot of them
don't there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do
about it

     If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside  I was
    hoping that NDW  would have plugged this but it seems no different
    than  in how it deals with memory and resources

No  This is a problem with the applications usually

     When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less
    likely my code will eat resources

There are books written on this one  In general just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit  Unfortunately I
understand that VB will internally lose resources for you so
there's no way to avoid this entirely

     Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for
    specifically

    Thanks for your help  As this is a common problem and I have seen only
    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
    me email

There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages
to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on
the resource pool

were on the opposite side of the house a ZyXEL UE high speed modem
a VGA monitor a x color monitor the RS and parallel ports on my
X terminal and a WD LAN card in my PC Not a good night

But the DeskJet ran as soon as I found a functioning serial and parallel
port to connect to it

    Hi
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's Plugin for Program Manager
      Its listed in most BBS'es as PLUGIN  Its an addon which gives
      some needed features to Progman such as the ability to better
      manage your groups change your cursor and icons on the fly
      constant status of RAM and resources Quickmenu a dropdown
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher plus some other neat stuff
      Used it liked it and even reg'd it G

      If you can't find it anywhere let me know and I'll zip it up and
      mail it to you shareware version of course g

Subject Please DO NOT post bitmaps
Lines 

From   pwisemansalmonusdedu Cliff
Organization   University of South Dakota
Subject        romanbmp In response to the requests for cool
bitmaps I am posting one
Date     PM

Due to the resolution and size it is in  parts

This is a uuencoded bitmap  X  colors
The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background
The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a x display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture Reguarding image
quality and resolution  I have not seen much better

Please do not do this

I don't know how the rest of you read news but here's how I do it  I
subscribe to an outernet system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download email and news articles automatically  When someone posts a
huge attached binary file I have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to  I also pay for
the connect time which is normally not a problem because I have a K
modem and each day's uploaddownload session takes only  minutes or so 
Today's session however lasted about  minutes because of ROMANBMP 
Consequently it cost me about  extra just to receive a file that I
didn't want in the first place

If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available there are other
ways to do it  either upload the file to an ftp site like
ftpcicaindianaedu which has a complete Windows section and tell
people how to get to it or use one of the newsgroups like
altbinariespictures or something like that which are file archives
rather than discussion groups  Don't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files especially when they're K in size

Thanks

Does anyone have the documentation for the MS Mouse Driver   I got it when  
I got Windows  but my Windows manual does not come with the documentation   
In particular I need to know how to turn it off and how to speed it up  
outside windows  The greater sensitivity is needed so I can play various  
games esp Xwing 


The sensitivity is changed using the S V or H parameter  
The commands do the following
V  vertical sensitivity
H  horizontal sensitivity
S  both 

Follow the parameter with a number from  to    slowest fastest
The default is   You can type the command mouse S right from the
keyboard or add it to autoexecbat

Hope this helps

 This morning at  am while I was working on my research paper I had to
 reboot a hung Dos program that did no disk io from within Windows 
 When my machine finished rebooting I found my windows directory and about two
 thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted
 
stuff deleted

This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago My HD was stacked
with Stacker v I run Dos Suddenly everything hung up and most of
the HD got corrupted directories changed into unreadable files with
'funny' names In other words it is probably just the doubledisk part of
Dos that is troublesome 

I now use Stacker v  and so far I have had no trouble 

Does this need to have anything to do with disk compression I have 
experienced the same thing a couple of times myself but without any disk 
compression stuff installed For example guess what happened when Norton 
SpeedDisk once crashed during defragmenting

From article CuBGKwworldstdcom by cfwworldstdcom Christopher F Wroten
 I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most
 EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA
 counterparts For instance the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIsE is
 only about as fast as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus which isn't
 what I would call fast
 
 I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't as a group on the
 same level of performance as Local Bus cards given that EISA video
 cards have a  bit bus to move data around instead of ISA's  bits
 
Good question
Answer The EISA bus does move  bits rather than ISA's 
        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus
        I think that's either  or  mhz
        The local bus designs also move  bits like the EISA but
        they move the data at the cpu speed up to  mhz
        So on a mhz cpu the local bus is moving bit data at
         mhz and the EISA is moving bit data at  or  mhz
        So the local bus should be  to  times faster than EISA on
        a  mhz cpu  EISA should be about two maybe  times as
        fast as ISA

 Since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher
 cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than
 and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board such as a
 Diamond SpeedStar X From PC Magazine's I think recent report
 I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card but it's
 around  which is just about double what my wallet will allow
 me to spend And for  I could get a Diamond Viper and still
 have  left over of course I'd have to get a Local Bus mother
 board too
 
That's a very good question  The EISA bus does have more advantages
over the ISA bus than just it's width  For example morebetter 
interrupts and bus mastering  But these other factors do not impact
 a video card very much  They have more impact on file servers with 
multiple hard drives fullthrottle network cards cdroms etc

 Can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration
 
 Thanks   Christopher Wroten cfwworldstdcom

Regarding the horror stories about DOSDOUBLEDISK and STACKER 
killing hard drives

I was wondering if the dos  MIRROR command works on the doubled
drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table
If it records the vital DoubleDisk info then using it daily
should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the
type of catastrophic failure discussed  If it doesn't then
shame on Microsoft

Hi

	I've got an older  motherboard old as in uses a 
keyboard controller and uses memory interleaving rather than caching
It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause
the machine to lock up reset button required but only when in 
enhanced mode  This occurs in Norton Desktop File Manager and when
trying to install software  Running Win  in standard mode works fine

	Has anyone run into this  Any ideas  Much thanks appreciated

I have a  sx  and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  
Adaptec  non busmastering controller Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate  Meg kbSec	ms avg seek   ms track to track 
Quantum  Meg SCSI  Kbsec   avg seek  track to track

First off all are these good results I don't know what typical values  
are

What I'm wondering now is the following My swap file is currently on the  
IDE I could move it to the SCSI which is  faster but then I would not  
be able to use bit access which might actuall make it slower So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there

Finally I also ran the above tests with the ASPIDOS driver loaded and I  
got no difference whatsoever in performance Is there any reason at all  
why I should load this driver

Thanks in advance I will post a summary if I get enough responses

On my PC I almost exclusively run windows The only dos based application  
I have is ProcommPlus  In my configsys I have emm loaded with the  
option noems no expanded memory Following a thread in one of the comp  
newsgroups I read that it was no necessary to have emm loaded Indeed  
in the manual it says that emm is used to get expanded memory out of  
extended memory Since I have the noems option it seems to me that the  
emm device is useless in my case 

Should I use emm or should I remove it from my configsys

Adaptec  non busmastering controller Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate  Meg kbSec	ms avg seek   ms track to track 
Quantum  Meg SCSI  Kbsec   avg seek  track to track

First off all are these good results I don't know what typical values  
are

Those are pretty typical I believe

What I'm wondering now is the following My swap file is currently on the  
IDE I could move it to the SCSI which is  faster but then I would not  
be able to use bit access which might actuall make it slower So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there

Keep the swap file on the IDE  bit access is worth a fair amount more
than

One of our users is having an unusual problem  If she does an AltTab to
a fullscreen DOS program when she goes back to Windows her desktop fonts
have changed  If she goes back to a fullscreen DOS program and then goes
back to Windows the font has changed back to its default font  It's not
a major problem everything works and the font is legible but it is
annoying  Does anyone have any idea why this happens  By the way she
has a DEC DLP machine

Should I use emm or should I remove it from my configsys

Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
configsys  If you are using WWW you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space  Reboot and Novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in configsys  You might have to remap some
of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives  Make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set
to the correct drive one above the lastdrive setting in the configsys file

and patent laws for computer algorithms concepts interfaces and
other intellectual properties to protect real innovators I'd hate to
be one who actually does innovate and then have Microsoft come in

that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft since
they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the

antitrust fears However for other companies and individuals who
have a great idea yet get it borrowed by larger corporations who
can afford to quickly bring it to market without any licensing from
the original innovator I feel much sympathy

I've checked cica and I'm sure it's not there I'm refering to the new
version of the driver that came out in   I have seen it on cserve
but I hesitate to dl  meg at  bps unless I really have to
     Alternativly is it possible to get Paradise or WD to mail me the new
drivers or don't they do that

     Finally is it even worth the hassle of getting these things or is
there not much improvement over my  version

 Hello
 
 	Who can tell me   Where can I find the PD or ShareWare   
 Which can CAPTURE windows 's output of printer mananger

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis conncting the printer
to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename
that you want to create I've found that putting a line in systemini in the
ports section with just a path and filename works The only problem is that
if you send more than one job the second one deletes the first

  has MS innovated ANYTHING 
 
  Really when you come down to it who cares I just hope MS keeps doing
  what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses

Lets see what MS products don't have major bugs in them  Oh but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up even if their
customers must buy new releases from them that are little more than
bug fixes  Anyone who buys a  computer system and then runs MS
Windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy  

Oh wait MS innovated the plastic housing on the MS mousedidn't
they  Logitech Inside

 Personally I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing
 what it does so well I hope to see much harsherstricter copyright
 and patent laws for computer algorithms concepts interfaces and
 other intellectual properties to protect real innovators I'd hate to
 be one who actually does innovate and then have Microsoft come in
 like a huge vulture and use their brute mass development staff
 marketing etc to get fat off of my innovation I don't have all
 that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft since
 they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the
 Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over
 antitrust fears However for other companies and individuals who
 have a great idea yet get it borrowed by larger corporations who
 can afford to quickly bring it to market without any licensing from
 the original innovator I feel much sympathy

You can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company
gathers together a bunch of knockoff packages and peddles them to
neophytes  If MS does anything it appears someone has to do it
first  It appears that MS is finding out that throwing money at
technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution

Hi
  I am thinking of upgrading to the Beta Version of Windows NT on a SX Mhz
Mb Hard disc Can someone please give me there opion on such a setup for
running NT and is the Operating System likely to be better than Windows or 
Unix's


Steve
eedukackingceres

I've been using Windows NT tm since the October release and I have to 
say that the March release is really a big improvement  Windows NT tm
is becomming usable

There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though
First for me at least is that you cannot get a fullspeed DOS box
What I mean is I cannot for instance run Falcon  or any other
resourse intensive program in a DOS box  It absolutley crawls  
And my machine is a  with a MB HD and MB RAM  If anyone
knows how to get a fast DOS box or fullscreen for that matter 
please let me know

The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff
For instance my PAS has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster
which is natively supported  nice because MediaVision hasn't 
produced drivers yet

Your disk should be large enough to keep an MB DOS partition and
give the rest over to Windows NT tm  The only thing is whenever
you wanted to run Windows programs you'd have to reboot and log into
Windows NT tm instead of just typing WIN

Windows NT tm does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows
though  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources  You should
really have at LEAST MB RAM though  One last thing modems work
well enough but I have yet to get my FAX card to work and I've never
heard of anyone else who did either

It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the
box whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity

I guess it comes down to  Windows NT tm is not yet for the faint
of heart it's still a beta  But it's a very GOOD beta

No it does not


Could you add some information to 'Non it does not'
Say for instance your source of information

I have a copy  It isn't in there  Microsoft says it will not be in
the release version either  He just asked if it did or not  I told
him 

Thanks

I'm looking for a good terminal program that will connect to
TCPIP using windows Some basic MSWindow that is connect to
a unix host would be great

Any suggestions

Take a look at WinQVTnet  the latest version is QVTnet 
It comes in versions that are direct to packet driver as well as a PC NFS 
version

It is priced quite low registration   student registration   and is 
a nice package  comes complete with VT terminal emulation FTP POP 
client LPR and NNTP client

You can FTP it from biochemistrybioccwruedu pubqvtnetqvtnetzip

It was also uploaded to ftpcicaindianaedu recently

We are using pkzip V and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these

Which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst
the rest

Is there a full windows version that does not call the DOS 
PKZIPPKUNZIP commands

Yes Russ there is 
QuinZip is a Windows version but I don't think it handles
all the functions available in the DOS version

The problem is that QuinZip is very very slow  So I think that WinZip 
is still the best choice to use pkzip in Windows

this is from the windows' FAQ
 
your file has to be less than  K
 at least that's what the faq says but Mine wont work for more than

 Hi everybody
     I guess my subject has said it all  It is getting boring
 looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows  So
 I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file
 I can share  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for
 some bmp files like some scenery files some animals files
 etc  I used to have some unfortunately i delete them all
 
 Anyway could me give me some help please
 

	In response to a different kinda wallpaper here's what I
use  I think the original gifwhatever was called notreal  The 
artist name and logo is in the lower right corner  You will need VGA
I think and I have this sized for x  color screens  Use
this in your Windows directory and do not tile it  Hope you enjoy



Try this one on for size  I'd rather not post her name but if you
email me I'll tell you who she is  Enjoy

From article CuBGKwworldstdcom by cfwworldstdcom Christopher F Wroten
 I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most
 EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA
 counterparts For instance the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIsE is
 only about as fast as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus which isn't
 what I would call fast
 
 I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't as a group on the
 same level of performance as Local Bus cards given that EISA video
 cards have a  bit bus to move data around instead of ISA's  bits
 
Good question
Answer The EISA bus does move  bits rather than ISA's 
        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus
        I think that's either  or  mhz
        The local bus designs also move  bits like the EISA but
        they move the data at the cpu speed up to  mhz
        So on a mhz cpu the local bus is moving bit data at
         mhz and the EISA is moving bit data at  or  mhz
        So the local bus should be  to  times faster than EISA on
        a  mhz cpu  EISA should be about two maybe  times as
        fast as ISA

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide at
least but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction  typically this is around 
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a  rate so I
would expect performance to be xx that of an ISA card  

So I guess for me the question is unanswered still  I would expect
him to be able to see a x speed difference and he apparently does
not

 On my PC I almost exclusively run windows The only dos based  
application  
 I have is ProcommPlus  In my configsys I have emm loaded with the  
 option noems no expanded memory Following a thread in one of the  
comp  
 newsgroups I read that it was no necessary to have emm loaded  
Indeed  
 in the manual it says that emm is used to get expanded memory out  
of  
 extended memory Since I have the noems option it seems to me that the  
 emm device is useless in my case 
 
 Should I use emm or should I remove it from my configsys
 
 Thanks for your help
 
 Eric
 
 emm noems enables the system to use the upper memory between   
and 
   That's a good place for device drivers DOS kernal etc
 Keep it in

Well I thought that highmemsys would do that too I just took out emm  
of my configsys and I'm still loading my other drivers high mouse vga  
shadow bios doskey etc I haven't checked memc but I believe I have  
managed to load them high ie between KB and KB

Also ever since I took out emm windows loads slightly faster I get  
about  extra meg of freemem in windows I'm running  enhanced with   
Meg RAM  Meg swap and I got rid of my ctrlalt del reboot problem  
before the computer would not reboot using ctrlaltdel after exiting  
windows 

I would really like to keep emm out of my configsys Anybody else have  
info on this

One of our users is having an unusual problem  If she does an AltTab to
a fullscreen DOS program when she goes back to Windows her desktop fonts
have changed  If she goes back to a fullscreen DOS program and then goes
back to Windows the font has changed back to its default font  It's not
a major problem everything works and the font is legible but it is
annoying  Does anyone have any idea why this happens  By the way she
has a DEC DLP machine
 
If it's any consolation I had a similar problem As I recall if I exited
from a DOS session while in fullscreen mode the menu titles had changed to a
scrambled version of the icon title font or something like that It only
started happening after I used IconTitleFaceName in WININI to change the
desktop font to Arial So I stopped exiting from DOS sessions while in
fullscreen mode

My Mac used to do something similar Aren't computers weird

Lets see what MS products don't have major bugs in them  Oh but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up even if their

Generally the second or third major release usually takes care of it
My advice based on plenty of personal experience is to never buy the
first version of anything from Microsoft  This includes major version
number upgrades from previous releases such as Microsoft C 
Always wait at least for the a upgrade or slipstream upgrade if
you're going to buy it

As an alternative try posting them at compbinariesmswindows and
just letting us know  A good idea is to post the article number here

There has been a long running discussion over changing the Startup
logo for Windows for a few weeks here While all the COPY methods are
great  haven't seen any mention of a program that will do it for
you 

Well I found one on CICA called winlogo Can't remember where
unfortuantely and it seems to work real well even comes with a
couple example RLE files 

What I'd really like though is a way to create RLE files myself
specifically the RLE format mentioned in the winlogo readme file Can
anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a REAL directory
path  All the ones I've seen mentioned didn't pan out

Here's the situation

At home I have MS Word for windows but no printer  At work I
have windows  a postscript printer but not MS Word  So I
configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer and use
the print to file option which produces a nice postscript file
which I then bring to work

My question  how do I print this postscript file through the print
manager at work If for example I select print from the file
manager it treats the postscript as a text file and gives me
several pages of postscript gibberish

I know that I can open a DOS window and do

	 copy fileps com

which does work but seems not to multitask very well  other applications
run rather slowly and often pause for 's of seconds

There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print
Manager but if there is I can't find any mention of it in the
documentation

Anyone know how to do this

Here's an interesting table showing how much resources an application
uses and how much it gives back on shut down  This is take from
Windows User May  issue


Application		Min Resource Use	Resource Not Returned
			GDI	USER		GDI	USER

WinSleuth Gold v					
Word For Windows vb					
Lotus  v						
Arts and Leters v					
PowerPoint v						
Corel Draw v						
Micro Designer v					
CrossTalk v						
Excel va						
HiJacck v						
ImageIn Color Pro					
PIcture Publisher v						
PowerLeads
  Executive Ed v					
Adobe Type Manager v				NA	NA
Skylight v						

The numbers are in percentage and are in a decreasing order

What does this table tells you if you frequently start and exit a
program that doesn't give back all of it's resources then you
continually lose these resouces  Therefore only open these programs
up once and leave them open


BTW  Maybe people can add to this list so we know what application to
watch out for
 
later

Suppose you want to change the particular icon for a program in
windows such as the MSDOS one  Would someone let me know how you can
do this



It depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that
comes standard with windows or with an icon from some other icon manager

Well if it is one of those that comes with windows just highlight the 
item by clicking once on it click on 'File' and then on 'Properties'
You should see a box which says 'Change icon' Click on it You are going
to be presented with some icons sometimes just one If you don't like
any of those presented click on the 'browse' box and look for the file
'moriconsdll' Select it Browse through the icons presented and just
double click on your desired icon

If you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager
say iconPower for instance open the icon manager at the bottom of your
screen where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace
When you have found your desired icon click on it once and while holding
the mouse button down pull this icon over the one you wish to change
And thats it

While working on my shareware toolbar I found myself 'eating' resources
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK and specifically the debug
kernel Once you have all the SDK stuff installed this also comes with
VC you run 'nd' which does a 'normaltodebug' swap The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower but you then execute the command
DBWIN and let it report to you what is going on You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to and possibly about other
peoples Apps is that OPAI'm sorry

It could also be that your shell is hogging the resources  For example
open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources
with ndw x as shell
 
then do the same with program manager and see if it's the shell or the
apps

Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so what have you
done to cure it

One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from
other workstations until it goes out on the network itself From then on other
workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf 
again 

The workstation is set up to share its discs etc The machine
is a DX MB RAM with Diamond Stealth video  It behaves this
way with a variety of  bit network adapters including a SMC Elite
It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver rather
than the Diamond drivers

Hello Cliff 

Many people on the internet like us have to pay for
every byte of data passed through subscribed news groups

Bitmaps are large Bitmaps cost us a lot of money There are
special newsgroups for bitmaps because of this We don't
subscribe to them Put you bitmaps in the right place
Read one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it
will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of
establishments like mine that you have just cost money

Some of them have very limited budgets

Development of what  Inhouse apps  Maybe but  certainly not apps
to be sold on an open market  Statistics like that are laughable
because they may simply mean that there are not enough shrinkwrapped
usable apps for UNIX and they have to be developed disproportionately
often as compared to the installed UNIX base

t

Actually you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops
mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows  PC
Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group
does its development under OS  Another trade rag did an article
recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations
with SoftPC to test out their work  SCO Unix is and has been a
reasonably popular development platform for DOS Windows and even OS
apps  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for
development work IMHO and apparently others agree

					 ABSTRACT

	      The format of images created for use by  MS  Windows  
	      applications  is	documented  in	the MS Windows Programmer's
	      Reference guide	This guide is intended as a  clearify  some
	      wording	of   the   specifications   and  to  put  forth  a
	      recommendation among the various alternatives

	      Please send updatescorrectionssuggestions and revisions	 to
	      me   Please  thank  me  for  writing  this on my own time by
	      keeping my name  with  the  document   Thank  you  for  your
	      respect

	      This document Copyright  by Thomas B Kinsman
	      If  desired  a  PostScript  version  of	this  document	 is
	      available

	      This information is free	 You get more than what you pay for
	      Don't sue me if I'm wrong


    OVERVIEW

    The DIB image file format is intended to be a Device Independent  Bitmap
    file  format  What Microsoft means by Device Independent is unclear to
    me Four pixel resolutions are supported  bit  bit  bit and  bit
    pixels

    These images were intended for use on DOS IBM or LittleEndian systems
    If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte
    swap all short and long integer values

    By convention DIB images end in the extension BMP   This  is  because



			      March  





				      


    they  are  a  superset of earlier bitmap image files  Consequently you
    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as BMP files

    Since DIB images files are a superset there are three flavors  of  DIB
    images
	 o   DOS DIB images  These are the recommended	 convention  and  the
	     form  which I will describe how to create	 They are intended for
	     applications running under MS Windows  in a DOS environment
	 o   OS DIB images  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor
	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager
	 o   Oldstyle Bitmap images

    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS

    The DOS DIB images consist of
	   A BITMAPFILEHEADER file header which identifies the file	 as  a
	     DIB  file	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image
	     file and the offset to the image data
	   A BITMAPINFOHEADER  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes
	   An optional palette of colors used by the image  If  it  exists
	     this  may contain   or  entries  Each entry is a Windows
	     RGBQUAD structure
	   The image data itself


    The OS DIB images consist of
	   The same BITMAPFILEHEADER file header which identifies the file
	     as	 a  DIB	 file	 This  header also gives the total size of the
	     image file and the offset to the image data
	   A BITMAPCOREHEADER  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes
	   An optional palette of colors used by the image  Again if  this
	     exists  it	 may  contain    or  entries  Each entry is a
	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure
	   The image data itself


    The Old Style image bitmap consists of
	   Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER	 Which	header
	     type is determined by the first long integer DWORD value
	   An optional color palette	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of
	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  if  the	header	was  a
	     BITMAPINFOHEADER or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures if the	header
	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER
	   The image data itself


    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES

    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps
    The headers need to be created and then written to the file  These header
    structures are defined in the MS  Windows  windowsh	include	 file
    Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not bit
    images  The five general steps are
	   Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER
	     structures the basic image information
	   If the image is a bit bit or an bit image	 creating  the
	     color palette of RGBQUADS
	   Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in

	     the bfSize field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER
	   Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the
	     file   and   putting  this  in  the  bfOffBits	field  of  the
	     BITMAPFILEHEADER
	   Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER
	     the color palette and the image data in that order

    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type
    defined  keywords	The following table describes these keywords for those
    not familiar with MicroSoft C

		     
		    					   
		     Typedefined keywords in MicroSoft C
		    
		     typedef 	 meaning		   
		    
		     BYTE    	 unsigned character	   
		     WORD    	 two byte unsigned integer 
		     DWORD   	 four byte unsigned integer
		    
































			      March  





				      


    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER

    This structure is defined in windowsh as
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER 
		 WORD	 bfType
		 DWORD	 bfSize
		 WORD	 bfReserved
		 WORD	 bfReserved
		 DWORD	 bfOffBits
	  BITMAPFILEHEADER

    The bfType field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'	  This	serves
    to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file  On an intel byte ordered
    machine IBM or a compatible this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the
    quantity 'M'    'B'  xd on an intel system

    The bfSize field is the total size of the file  For our	purposes  this
    field  is equal to the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER plus the size of the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times
    the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD plus the number of bytes of image data	If the
    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form this value can be
    calculated	ahead  of  time   Otherwise this field needs to be filled in
    later

    Both the bfReserved and the bfReserved  fields  are  always  set  to
    zero

    The bfOffBits field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data
    from  the  start  of the file  For our purposes this field should be set
    to	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER	  plus	 the   size   of   the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times
    the size of a RGBQUAD  This works out because the image data  is  written
    write after the color palette if one exists


















			      March  





				      


    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER

    This structure is defined in windowsh as
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER
		 DWORD	 biSize
		 DWORD	 biWidth
		 DWORD	 biHeight
		 WORD	 biPlanes
		 WORD	 biBitCount
		 DWORD	 biCompression
		 DWORD	 biSizeImage
		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter
		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter
		 DWORD	 biClrUsed
		 DWORD	 biClrImportant
	  BITMAPINFOHEADER

    The biSize field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure
    itself   When  reading  the  image	 file	this  value is what is used to
    determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a
    BITMAPCOREHEADER

    The biWidth field is the width of the image in image pixels

    The biHeight field is the height of the image in image lines

    The biPlanes field should always be set to   This data is written  out
    as if there was one color plane

    The biBitCount field is the bitdepth of the image  This must be either
       or  depending on the bitdepth of the image data

    The biCompression field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is
    compressed	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 runlength  encoding
    However I have never seen any images which use it and don't know yet how
    it works  Set this field to zero long zero or L to indicate that the
    data is not compressed

    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to
    zero   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to
    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information

    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be biClrUsed
    For	 bit	and  bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the
    possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  biClrUsed
    colors  If you are using only  colors with an bit image then you may
    only want to save  of the possible  palette entries  Generally  set
    this field to zero



			      March  





				      


    COLOR PALETTES

    Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure	  The  RGBQUAD
    structure is defined in the windowsh include file as
	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD 
		 BYTE	 rgbBlue
		 BYTE	 rgbGreen
		 BYTE	 rgbRed
		 BYTE	 rgbReserved
	  RGBQUAD
    The rgbReserved field is always zero  For each color used  the	amount
    of Blue Green and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is
    written to the file  A value of zero in  the  rgbBlue  rgbGreen  or
    rgbRed   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not
    contribute to the color composition  A value  of    in	any  of	 these
    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color
    composition



    IMAGE DATA

    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image
    file   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative and
    certainly was

    Within the image data each line written out is padded to  the  next  four
    byte  quantity   So  if  you had an bit image which was only one pixel
    wide you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line   The
    number of bytes per line can be calculated as

		 bytesperline  widthinpix  bitdepth       

	or in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure

		 bytesperline  biWidth  biBitCount       


    When writing out your image data you must write it out bottom line first
    The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the
    first line of image data in the file

    For bit bit and bit images information is written	as  you	 would
    expect   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte  Four bit
    images are padded two pixels to a byte  Eight bit images are written  one
    pixel per byte  Twentyfour bit images are written three bytes per pixel
    However for bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the
    order  blue  green red  While most image file formats write data out in



			      March  





				      


    an RGB ordering a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 BGR
    ordering

    SUMMARY

    This  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  DIB	 images	  from
    applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines	If you
    find out any more about DIB images please pass the information on	to  me
    so that I can modify this document accordingly

I have a very funny yet confusing problem  I am using Telemate within
Win   Everytime I close dos box my Telemate operation get affected
Normally I am doing file transfer  However if I open  close windows
program everything seems running smoothly  My file transfer operation
get affected only if I close dos box

Can somebody please gimme some pointers on what is going on and how to
fix it

thanks in advance

A friend of mine uses Windows  to do most of her work
Unfortunately she has very bad eyesight and we haven't
been able to figure out how to change the default font
used by the system and application menus or the font used
by the Help program what use is hypertext if you can't
read it to make it legible to her

If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts
of any software package that makes Windows more accessible
to visually handicapped people please let me know

Thanks

	munch


You must of read too many OS advertisements  Crash Protection is such
a marketing gimick it isn't funny  Out of  months of using Windows on my 
new machine I've only had it crash ONCE and I don't have a run of the mill
configuration


	munch  following is reformatted


It does sound funny I will admit  But for me it is true  Windows
 crashed on
all of the time and from what I have read in PC Mag this is not
 the exception


	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare
	Windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by
	an errant application My personal favorite  Any one of the Corel
	 programs  On the other hand I have had OS crash randomly
	a number of times mostly just running it's own applications

	For instance  Today I discovered a new one  While I was downloading
	with Procomm Plus For Windows running seamless with the standard
	VGA drivers on a runo' da mill VGA cardx I decided that
	I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my 
	finger  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless 
	I fired up a full screen WinOS session  Whoops the download
	finished while WinOS was loading  It had just gotten
	the pointer up so I hit altescape to get back t the desktop
	I have a lot of fonts so loading takes a good long while
	
	Blam  Screen trashed Procomm hangs up  Hm  Well I can sorta
	see the mouse so I clicked on the minimized WINOS session 
	and got back my fullscreen Windows session but the color were
	offred and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys
	So I closed this and got back to the desktop now fully restored

	PP was still sitting window open but it was no longer 
	connected to the com portso I exited it the normal way
	it told me I was still online and it would hang up though it
	was already hung up  Hm  Well load anotheno bad idea 
	Shutdown and reboot

	Ok refresh first Now shutdown  Yes everything is closed

	Hm  Nothing seems to be happening  Let's see Ah the 
	windows list still comes up  OK let's try shutdown again

	No go  Huh

	Alright wait  seconds to see if it's just running slow

	Hmm  Still seems to be running OS  Try shutdown again
	Nothing  Oh well  Reboot  Enjoy the checkdisk time
  
	In this case a part of the OS crashed not only itself but
	OS entirely which isn't even smart enough to tell when its
	been compromised I guess  In everyday specifically today
	use


 OS gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
generally anything they aren't supposed to have


	That's the idea anyway  In truth when a program crashes on 
	OS it will bring the system down with it  The programs that
	would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS but programs
	that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS screaming to a halt
	task protection or no  

	For instance I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
	WP  DOS locks up my system  It works fine under DOS or even in
	a dos box under Windows   Admittedly it doesn't crash if I run
	WP full screen but the first time this bug big me it bit hard



  If windows works for you
then great  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS is the OS of 
choice  If windows doesn't crash on you and you don't mind waiting on each
task


	Please explain  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is
	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even
	then not longI get  to  pages dumped to the printman per 
	minute and can still go do thingsslowlywhile it's doing 
	thisI've downloaded with PP  while printing



 and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS


	Not sure what you mean here  OS sees  megs uses  or six
	of these for it's own use more if you want to count WinOS 
	Windows sees  megs uses  or  more like  if you count the
	disk cache as I am for OS for itself  If memory efficiency 
	were a big issue PC GEOS would be the current king of the 
	Intel desktop  


 some of the
key reasons for using OS are gone  I probably  would still use it but it
would be more of an even fight


	On the other hand I am finally able to say with some confidence
	that both OS and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to
	them  For instance the machine I am sitting at runs both fine 
	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows 
	But ran OS without a hitch once I got it through a crash 
	install  On the whole I'd say OS is a whole lot more sensitive
	than Windows but there are I suppose machines that Windows
	just doesn't like  


Wittism of th week I think that it's wrong to believe in an ism you should
                     believe in yourself  Ferrish Bueller

of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a Hot Prospect Now NeXT is nearing release
of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on based PC's yet is identical to
the  version In fact NEXTSTEP  includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and

Hi  I am trying to develop a utility to view WORD for window file But 
to do that I need to know the format of the DOC  word for window file 
format  filesCan anybody  tell me what is the format of DOC file or 
direct me where can I get it Or is it proprietory format 
Your help is greatly appriciated

Thanks

The format for Word for Windows doc files is available from Microsoft
Call their Developer Support Services number sorry don't have it handy
and ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec

Warning  It is not terribly useful and you will need to do a lot of
looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored

General primer

Word for Windows stores its data in two chunks  The first chunk is the
actual text in the file  This is all stored together and has nothing
but text and graphics  The second chunk is the formatting information

For general use to read a Word for Windows file skip the first  bytes
of the file its a general header  Then read the remaining text until you
hit binary data

Matt

I assumed he was referring to OS's bit flat model addressing while DOS

agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things  It's annoying too
But when just a Windows user I don't think about it much  And I doubt many
other people think about it or even care when just writing a document
calcing a spreadsheet etcIt works and they get their work done

Just a neutral comment
It's funny I think how arguments about Windows vs OS sound so very
similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that
It's somehow very personal to people  Convictions are irrational and
there's nothing wrong with thatit's justinteresting

	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare
	Windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by
	an errant application My personal favorite  Any one of the Corel
	 programs  On the other hand I have had OS crash randomly
	a number of times mostly just running it's own applications

I  do know  that  IBM systems the PS SLC in  particular have
absolutely no  problem  with  OSnever had  a random crash  while
running any of  my programs under  OS   In fact I  don't  remember
ever crashing

Of course I really don't run any  OS programs just the  same bunch
of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running

And  when  I  had  the  SLC  this is  the  SLC  system  running
DosWindows I had only  one crash and it was consistent   FTP had a
tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files mb  from
particularly fast  clients  DTR's  KKsec I  figured out the
problem was with smartdrv's write bufferingif I turned off the write
buffer everything would work fine

FTP under OS has never locked  though  I can even format  floppies
to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS

	For instance I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
	WP  DOS locks up my system

Yeah I guess I'm willing to admit that OS  is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware  WP for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC

	Please explain  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is
	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even
	then not longI get  to  pages dumped to the printman per 
	minute and can still go do thingsslowlywhile it's doing 
	thisI've downloaded with PP  while printing

Well  I save all  my  personal files to floppy  and when  i did that
under Windows a floppy save of a large file hung up the system

I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background

 and not being able to address your memory better than DOS

	Not sure what you mean here

The idea is  that OS's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows
DOS  sessions  I  let  XPL a  shareware calculus program see around
KB of free conventional memory which lets me  do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS where it would see
around KB of conventional RAM  I  also found it really handy for
my own DOSbased programs which without  any rewriting could now
handle larger data sets simulate for more iterations etc Of course
the  point is  now moot  since  the OS programs I now write  simply
never run into memory limitations  I never programmed  for Windows
so I don't have much of a comparison here though

If you believe that I have a nice piece for swamp for you for RE

Another trade rag did an article

I've been using Final from CODA for some time but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts I have a  PC with lots of disk space and memory a Postscript 
laser Win Finale  and I recently installed ATM  I've been 
fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time and when I needed to do 
some work with Finale things didn't print properly It might  and it might 
not  have anything to do with the installation of ATM from something to 
 but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore 

The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print which is a 
rather important font  

I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS in the 
Finale section of WININI but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't 
work and it's those EPS files I need When I look at the eps files 
generated the only font which appears there is Courier I found out that if I 
manually changed the Courier point to Petrucci point in the EPS file 
everything worked ok but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs 
to work with 

And yes in the SpecialFontFont names dialog box all the fonts I need are 
listed with the correct mapping between Finale Screen and Printer fonts 
Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well that is after I included OwnPS and all my other Windows 
applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well 

Has anyone encountered problems like this 

What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software I have 

Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X

  Regarding the horror stories about DOSDOUBLEDISK and STACKER

  I was wondering if the dos  MIRROR command works on the doubled

  If it records the vital DoubleDisk info then using it daily
  should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the
  type of catastrophic failure discussed  If it doesn't then
  shame on Microsoft
  

 MIRROR is one of those DOS commands that didn't survive the change 
 from DOS   It's been dropped along with BACKUP JOIN EDLIN  
 and a couple other crummy old DOS commands  You can still use the
  commands if you absolutely have to but they are not included
 on the  distribution disks

 However in MIRROR's case I'm  certain that it does not know
 anything about DoubleSpaced drives

	I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell
network using shell version  I think The workstation a  was set
up to run Windows  with the network about a year ago Needless to say
I'd like to upgrade it to Windows  and have it work with the network

	Basically the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive but
several DOS applications like Word Perfect will be on the network I'd
mainly want Windows to access the network drives the network printers and
perhaps handle some network functions as well If I could multitask the DOS
apps whose executables are on the network that'd be great but I could live
without it

	Eventually I'd like to get a few other s in the office working
with the network and Windows  as well However most of the terminals
are s which leaves the network pretty much DOSbound and I guess that
leaves out Windows for Workgroups And in the future maybe there'd be
Norton desktop but that's gettingahead of myself

	As you can guess I've never done anything like this before I've
read through the networks material that came with Windows but still I'd
like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area

	Please reply by Email I don't scan these newsgroups often

	Thanks for any replies

This may work but won't it involve invoking the applications eg if you
drag a bmp or txt file to the min Print Manager icon won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing  If you just want to drag a file
txt or bmp to a print server icon with stay at front attributes you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print

I've started getting a message from Windows  whenever I try to execute
a DOS program from Windows either thru the Program Manager or the File
Manager A message box comes up and says This program or one of its
components is compressed Use the MSDOS expand command to expand the
file

Now I know this is bogus because I can always execute the program
from DOS when not running windows The program in question is COMMANDCOM
yup the basic DOS command line shell And the expand command tells
me that the file is already expanded

All my windows apps work just fine  I only get this message when trying
to execute a DOS program from Windows

Clues anyone  Thanks   Christopher Wroten cfwworldstdcom

I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows  as
a front end The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as footxt  I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
footxt OK but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move footxt to a specified directory rename it using
the current date and time and delete the original footxt 

In other words footxt gets renamed as  say on May 
at  the user gets a timeindexed backup of his mail files and
footxt is freed up for the next packet of mail since my AutoExec
macro points to it

My main question is this 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
timedate variable in the new filename 


Thanks

read it to make it legible to her

If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts

Thanks

The May issue of PCComputing page  has a Windows hint and tips for
just this thing  You have to edit the WININI file and add a couple
of lines  I tried it and it works  I actually made my Title bar
and iconized text and icon text smaller  On my monitor it works well
You can select a larger font also  You edit the WININI file with
a font name in your system directory  Read the article because I would
not want to retype it here in case I type errored and caused your
system problems

  Well I've come into some money and want to buy CDROM sound board

boards and CDROM's because until now I never thought I'd have enough
money  

  So can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good
package including CDROM sound and speakers and software I
suppose OR since I don't REALLY need the CDROM right now give me
some good ideas for sound boards and speakers  Those I could REALLY
use now  I have looked at SoundBlaster Pro which costs about as much
as I think I want to spend on a board  and I've looked at the
Gravis Sound board which is about  and I don't know the
advdisadv of either of these boards  

  Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound and to
use in Windows  to utilize sound capabilities there  So any
concise info on sound boards complete multimedia packages etc would
be greatly appreciated  If anyone else is interested in this info I
would be glad to summarize responses and post  

  And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right
direction and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth  Thanks

I am working with Visual Basic v for windows
Specifically I am working on an application that generates formatted reports
Since some of these reports can be rather large my first question is

  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
Visual Basicwindows beyond the k limit

As I have not as yet  being optimistic  come across a way to get
around the above problem I am working on the following approach

I am trying to create my own defined template in MSWord using the
WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual BasicVB and load
this template of mine which will work in the following way

It will first open MyOwnINI file created in VB  at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted and read the section from the
INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template  which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the INI file

  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic is there a way
to specifychange the default INI file which is winini to MyOwnINI file

 When using the file Input function in WordBasic  is there a way to
read more than the k at one time


Any help will be appreciated

I'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs  A
couple of issues ago PC Mag listed as Editor's Choices both Conversion
Artist and Hijaak for Windows  Anyone have any experience with those or
some others  I'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days and
I'm not making much progress with the screen shots  
 
I'm currently using DoDot and I'm about to burn it and the disks it rode
it on  It's got a lot of freaky bugs and oversights that are driving
me crazy  Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a
TIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size it will swap the left
and right sides of the picture   Usually it confines itself to not
copying things to the clipboard so I have to save and load pix for
editing in paintbrush or crashing every hour or so
 
The one nice thing it has though is it's dither option  You'd think
that this would turn colors into dots which it does if you go from say
 colors to  colors  But if you go from  or  colors to BW
you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which
turn to white  For me this is useful because I can turn light grays on
buttons to white and the dark grays to black and thereby preserve the
deffect on buttons and other parts of the window
 
If you understood my description  can you tell me if another less
buggy program can do this as well
 
Much thanks for any help

rdavmonuccmonasheduau AB Wuysang writes
 But the impressive performance of the Graphite was
 not its Winmark it was its Wintach result esp the paint
 performance Judging from the Wintach tests I can hardly
 imagine that there is a cheat driver for it

I received my Graphite VL on Thursday and I've had a little bit of 
experience with it now  In general it feels FAST although this
is the first VLB card that I have tried  Still the results are 
impressive

With my DX w MB running at x I've had the following
WinTach  results


Card				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall

ATI Graphics Ultra						
ATI Ultra no aperture					
Hercules Graphite VL						

Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB
had an overall WinTach score of about   The Ultra Pro was nearly as
fast in text handling but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests

As an additional test we handtimed a complex CorelDraw slide resize
redraw times  There was no swapping but I'd expect there is a fairly
heavy load on the CPU  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 
seconds with ATI Ultra Pro at   This jives with Steve Gibson's
contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex
Micrografx Draw document

So far I'm very impressed  The drivers look solid and the card flies
The installation and utilities are different but comparable to ATI's  And
I didn't have to wait for Build  for some reliability  With Hercules'
software developer special you can get an evaluation copy of the card for
just  or  for the ISA version  Call  if you want to
give it a try  I'm a happy customer now

get the WinMarks using PC Magazines WinBENCH and post the results here
I am interested in SVGA drivers only plain VGA users should run the Win

Seen from a typographically point of view ATM using PostScript fonts
is better than TrueType the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is
gorgeous
Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in
a PS font as problematically they may have better use of the Unicode
features of TT fonts in Windows NT

I've seen lots of really beautiful and printableinsmallsize PS fonts
I haven't seen those as TT fonts Most of them are rendering quite
inaccurate in small sizes esp as screen fonts
Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font the first
looks better

I am hoping that there will be ATMNT

 Changes in Version  update from v to v

	In this version we have revised COSYPAK to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v  
Since Mathematica  provides a better  and  working 
LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than 
Mathematica v did we adopted them This has made COSYPAK 
smaller Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported 
the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the 
COSYPAK v are no longer needed directly by COSYPAK v For 
power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gausseedspgatechedu  or  IP    On  
the  downside the disadvantage of this update 
can be that Mathematica  requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version 


	
 For Mathematica  users
	
	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica  in  
the directory For' Please move all files and directory under For into  
the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory 


	    
 Introduction
   
    This is an unsupported release of COSYPAK  a COntrol SYstems 
analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using 
Mathematica  Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package 
    
    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
NeXT TM computer a UNIX based workstation They have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts Ogata  Phillips and Harbor  for 
undergraduate courses in Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems 
Engineering Department of CWRU In addition to the NeXT they have 
also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers TM and 
IBM PC's TM running MS WindowsTM We would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics

    Once installed see below for instructions this  collection  of  
Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user Bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks COSYNotes which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages The notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine standard undergraduate Control Engineering text books 
listed in the references Examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file The contents of the notebooks in the COSYNotes directory are 
given below

 Compressed Files

        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSYPAK v
packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are

 COSYPAKtarZ     		compressed tar file for Unix systems
	
 COSYPAKsithqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by BinHex  
				format requires the   shareware
				 Stuffit file v  or higher 
	
 COSYPAKIBMzip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MSDOS
    
     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on 
Macintosh  IBM PC  Unix systems also


 Installation of COSYPAK

 o In UNIX Command line type the following command

      zcat COSYPAKtarZ  tar xvf 

 o In Macintosh open the sithqx file using the shareware
    Stuffit v  or higher
  
 o In IBM Command line type the following command

      pkunzip o d COSYPAKIBMzip

NOTE This zip file was zipped by zip utility v You must use 
pkunzip version  or  higher to unzip it  IBM PC's may limit the 
directory name characters to eight In that event type pkunzip o d 
COSYPAKzip  You can also unzip the COSYPAKIBMzip file on any 
Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it


     Uncompressing and untarring COSYPAKtarZ or unzipping 
COSYPAKIBMzip will create a directory called COSYPAK
         	
Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
COSYPAK containing the following three files four 
subdirectories and their contents

 Important 	

	The notebook example filesma files will be under the 
COSYNotes directory  To use the notebooks move the directory COSYPAK' to  
a 
directory that  Mathematica can recognize 
	
        LocalLibraryMathematicaPackages     	on a UNIX machine
        MYHardDiskMathematicaPackages   	on an Apple Macintosh
        cwinmathpackages                  	on an IBM PC

	At the beginning of the Initialization cell of each notebook 
in  COSYNotes directory we list the example about how to make 
Mathematica identify the directory

	 Initialization of Path 

	 Example For a UNIX machine  Default  
	
	PathJoinPath
	LocalLibraryMathematicaPackages
	
	
	 Example For an Apple Macintosh   
	
	PathJoinPath
	MYHardDiskMathematicaPackages
	
	
	 Example For IBM PC 	
	 
	
	PathJoinPath	
	 cwinmathpackages	
		

Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
Mathematica comment sign ' and ' before and after Path' 
setting

	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory

        LocalLibraryMathematicaPackages     	on a UNIX machine
        MYHardDiskMathematicaPackages   	on a Apple Macintosh
        cwinmathpackages                	on an IBM PC


 Mathematica  users
	
	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica  in 
the directory For Please move all files and directory under For 
into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory 


 Getting started

       After installation start Mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the COSYNotes directory All notebooks load their own packages 
Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics

I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm
looking for a Windows  Driver for it  It's based on the Cirrus Logic
CLGDAPCB chip  I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand
and they say that only Windows  divers were ever written by the manufacturer
So if there's a V driver out for this chip set I'd like to know  
preferably by email at rjwjameswaikatoacnz
                     
Thanks is advance

 I guess thats why there are so many new DOS and OS applications
 coming and hardly any Windows apps coming out irony
 
 Yep  the os apps are comming the os apps are comming 
 
 Yet another Microminion hoping that if he says something long enough 
 
 Hey I remember the good old days running OS  alpha with Brief
 Excel Word and a couple internal apps product support database 
 client OSbased email frontend Life was good But it was also
 impractical 'cause the masses were using Windows and my job was to help
 the masses

Apparently you prefer OS to Windows or at least did 

To windows  yes

by you last comment
do you mean that your knowledge of OS is dated it must be or argue

It's definitely dated  I used OS   alpha  when msft was
developing it

I suspect that the masses were using Windows because they couldn't afford
to use OS can you say as much for NT

I preferred Windows  because it was more stable  faster than 
but could still run more apps than OS again I made this choice
before  was released

But getting back to the original question do you have any data on the
relative avaliablity or Windows applications versus OS applications
or any evidence that stated support will be dropped by any of the above

No I've seen no such data

 Grow up  Other companies are supporting OS  Make points please  
 
 If you see life in terms of debating points I think you need
 to grow up

Ah yes I remember the days when we kids would engage in orderly debate
but our parents would usually find out and force us to act in the more
mature manner of heaping invective and casting rocks and dirt clods

hee hee  good one    

 It doesn't help Microsoft
 to have employees I assume you are due to the ORG may be wrong saying
 such trivial things on the net  
 
 So
 Microsoft employs over  employees Walking into this place is 
 not like walking into the  commercial There are individuals
 here You think they'll all talk the same way say the same thing 
 and help Microsoft all the time   If so WHY

It appears to me that he is voicing his frustration to an attitude
he has encountered before  

and one that I've encountered as well

I on the other hand have had no such
experience other than from reading this thread  You at Microsoft
are in a unique position to present facts 

Hmm Are you sure  I'm speaking from my own experience as an
OS user Certainly people in say the NT marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of say
research on upcoming NT and OS apps vs Windows and MSDOS apps
Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data if it exists

but prefer to make baseless claims or attack to poster  I must 
make the same conclusion as he 

I will confess to at times attacking the poster  

 USENET accounts are not restricted to the marketroids They're
 open to any fulltimer and are primarily for recreational purposes
 Yeah some of us are likely to answer a question or hop into a 
 debate  Or make stupid comments You know like human beings

I'm sorry this newsgroup is only for opressed hackers and stranded
extraterrestrials not humans  How about altmicrosofthumans  You
seem to discount others anyway

Again my point was that not all microsofties are here to sell 
readers on our products which would conflict with the noads 
philosophy of usenet  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are like
members of the BORG

Even so my point still stands to an extent  that k limits appear all
over the place where they really are not necessary such as the edit control
limit

While the K limit may not be necessary limitation they probably fall
within the category of 'reasonable' limitations  If you find yourself
trying to allocate an edit control for more than K of text it's probably
time take a good look at your program's design

Why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory
handles allowed

In what way is  a 'small' number  It seems to me that you'd hit the
wall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global
handles unless of course you're abusing GlobalAlloc


And please don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the
resources available under other operating systems  All systems have
limits  The question is whether or not the limits are reasonable  So
far you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows'
limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems

I would like to find a Windows x driver for a video board that is
based on the Chips  Technologies chipset  The actual board is a
Scorpion Framegrabber made by Univision  It is based on the CT
chipset but only barely supports the graphics mode  I am hoping that
any CT driver could be used in the xx mode

Thanks

But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete
a tree  it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete

You don't and never had to  That's what enhanced shells are for  Remember 
DOS and NDOS  I mean come on you can't expect DOS to cover everything 
from R  Microsoft has other projects to work on

 They want you to move to Windows  then later to Win and eventually to
 Cairo  This way they give you a reason to

By deliberately crippling the product  Surely no

Oh hold on I guess you're right  That certainly stinks of MicroSoft
marketing techniques

I don't think they deliberately crippled the project  On the other hand it 
IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on
top of DOS  I mean you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC  With 
XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna 
need a fast processor

Re DOS's death
Well Amen to that but I wish it were a damn sight deader  For a dead
product its used an awful lot  And I suspect its going to carry on
twitching for a long while yet which isn't doing anyone any good

Except for the people who use DOS programs which means about  or more of 
the business world

much BS deleted for brevity

Again my point was that not all microsofties are here to sell 
readers on our products which would conflict with the noads 
philosophy of usenet  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have

It certainly smacks of that Remember the POLL that you quoted saying that
you had seen a  of users being satisfied with DOS  Care to recall how
unbiased the sample set was That post sure looked like FUDand coming
from a microsoftie  well it sure seemed like something was not on level

Advocacy is GOOD  but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very 
unethical  especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that
OS

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are like
members of the BORG

That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion  never seen more 
defensive people in my life Moreover many of their posts seem to encourage
this too IMHO

Seriously speaking it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for
MS's actions  most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing
I am sure that they ARE very talented etc  I have not doubts about their 
abilities just about the ethics of their marketing practices

Hello

I want a little network for  users All users want to run Windows
The most important things I want for the network are filesharing
mail utility two printers on one of the computers and a faxmodem
card on one of the computers We all want to use each others harddisk

My idea was to buy three computers one DX and two DX All
three have a Mb local harddisk the  also has a very large
harddisk All three also have a network card The  is connected to
the printers and contains the faxmodem card And last but not least
Workgroups for Windows

My questions
 Is this possible
 What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups
  for Windows
 Will all the computers be fast enough Behind all three someone
  is working

Thanks

  For Windows NT is there an alternative to the archane fairly useless
DOS batch programming language  For OS IBM introduced the REXX language
as an alternative to BAT  Surely Windows NT should do the same thing
right

  In lieu of the above is there ANY way to escape the CRLF in a
BAT file and continue a single command across multiple lines  I have an
application which exits to the system and submits a batch file  The batch
file is created on the fly from sitespecific code stored within the
application  As currently designed the line length for the stored code
and the output file BAT file is  characters which is not enough for
all the options that must be specified on a particular command  It would
help tremendously if I didn't have to redesign my code to kludge around the
lack of a true batchshell programming language

 rest deleted 

As a followup to my post let me add that

I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user so please excuse my ignorance
However I'm a developer at SAS Institute and one component of the
application that I support is the ability to submit a SAS batch job from
within an interactive SAS session  The user site can enter their
sitespecific batch profile into a dataset within our product specifying
the pathname to the SAS executable specifying site specific SAS options
etc  At run time certain variables are resolved and the resolved file is
written to an external ascii file  Then I exit to the operating system and
run the job asynchronously returning to the interactive session as soon as
the job is submitted  The batch job then runs concurrently with the
interactive session

As currently designed the internal dataset has a record length of 
characters  But to run the batch job the command to reinvoke SAS in
batch mode requires more than  characters  Up til NT this has not been a
problem since every job controlshell language up til NT eg
MVSCMSVMSUNIXOS had a way to escape the CRLF and enter a single
command across multiple lines OS via their REXX language which is
STANDARD with OS

The gist of all this is since this application is for endusers not
within my company I have to try to develop this process using native NT
Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party
companies that provide alternative script languages for WindowsWindows NT
And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative
script language if they had it but I can't develop under the assumption
that they have anything other than what comes with NT

I saw another post on this list the subject was something like Is vi
available for Windows in which someone said that vi make awk and
ksh was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT  What is that product  Is
it a separate product or part of Windows  ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites

One last question  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities
ie I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run
there  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific
commands this would also help me improve this process  If you can comment
on these commands I would appreciate it

Thanks again for the help

   I am setting up my DOSUNIX box on a M IDE and a M SCSI drive
and was wondering about the use of the MSDOS  JOIN command  I
like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C
D  E crap that DOS enforces  I like how it would mimic mount
points of UNIX filesystems  I have heard that there were problems
with using it or at least under older versions of DOS  Please tell

I solved my problem  I still do not understand why it happens ths
way perhaps some of you C gurus can explain this to all of us

For some reason when I define the following functins in the class
definition in the h file the compiler thinks some pure virtual
functions are not defined  When I placed these two in a separate
source file and compiled them the problem went away  Any ideas what
happen  Are the functions that are defined in the class construct all
inline   Is this the problem

virtual int            isEqual const Object FAR obj const
 return this  HashEntry obj 

virtual void           printOn Rostream os const

 os   HWindow is   void FAR  hWindow   n

Hiyas ALL

Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend I 
couldn't wait to install it I had gotten an advertisement for it and put 
it aside 
with my list of 'I Wants' After installing the software it didn't load 
No part of 
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well

	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty 
million different questions about my system concluded that I had one of 
the 
systems that the software was 'incompatible with' Of course they're 
willing to 
give me my  back What a waste of time and energy  The folks on their 
support line although nice are extremely ignorant regarding the workings 
of 
Windows  
	After my experience with the installation of the SB  I  learned 
some of the function of windows dll files Before sending back Desktop 
Animator  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of 

dll files I had I had  versions of cpalettedll one dated  and  
K the 
other dated  and smaller the  smaller version was the one supplied 

with Desktop Animator I moved the bigger older version of cpalettedll  
to a 
directory outside my path For some reason I had the older Cpalettedll 
in my 
Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windowssystem directory 
When I did this the animator's editor loaded and so did  other of the 
applications in the package the main application still didn't load Does 
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions 

for troubleshooting

On a recently acquired Gateway  machine when starting Windows
three copyright statements flash on the screen right after the MS logo
disappears and before ProgramManager takes over  This does not happen
on any other of our machines and I am wondering whether this is a
feature or whether this is related to several problems we are having
with the machine

Not really Query What do you mean by PAID  Are you implying that helped to

I mean they paid the companies that developed the applications ie We'll
give you x million dollars if you port application y to OS  I suppose
the company in question could use the x million dollars for whatever they
want

Would you like to post figures
for MS as well I suppose

No I'd rather not  First of all I don't have exact figures and I don't

from Microsoft just posted a figure of  million payment from IBM to
Borland and that's somewhere in the range that I've heard

It was  and actually another msdos team member posted it
Note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
about that or

Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was 

When I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them having
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
has very little positive to say about the product I figured it wasn't
from there so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked
And I was told it was from a survey of registered users  And I 
posted that on the net when people asked where the  figure came 
from

That post sure looked like FUDand coming from a microsoftie 
 well it sure seemed like something was not on level

Hmm I figured if Chuck posted the numbers why not include where
they came from I also find it interesting that postitive info is 
fear uncertainty  doubt

Advocacy is GOOD  but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very 
unethical  especially when you have a vested interest in the success 
of that OS

  I think you've got me confused with someone else I don't 
pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need or that other
OSes including unix  OS don't provide useful andor necessary
features  I also don't push people to use MSDOS I even posted in
composmsdosmisc that I suggest waiting before installing a 
new os esp if you have trouble support is always overloaded 
during release unless the sales are a total bomb

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are like
members of the BORG

That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion  never seen more

I ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes Do you really
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it

I just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie
cutter We don't all think alike  Yeah ChuckSt and I have some inside
info on MSDOS  doesn't mean that everyone else does

Is there a hotkey for the Windows  screen saver utility  If not is
there an easy way to create one  The reason that I need one is that my
dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
from the computer until the screen saver kicks in as if that is terribly
secure  Also the system manager won't let any software be added so 
another program such as LOCKZIP from cica or a different screen saver
is out

Thanks for any and all help

Which translates to  not satisfied  I don't think it's the awkward 
recursive deletion that's bugging people it certainly isn't the nice Windows 
interfaces for new DOS accessories CPAV defrager undelete

	As far as I've noticed it's DoubleSpace crashes

Frankly the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises 
me  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace it is 
less likely to crash unlike Stacker which fools the OS but DO is gullible 
anyway   DOS  is aware of DoubleSpace isn't it

Anyway good job on DOS  and DOS  is good for new users  Just beware the 
doublespace

Hello All

    It is my understanding that all TrueType fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows  this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do  First off am I correct in this thinking 
secondly if that is the case  can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts  Any ideas

	If JD Power and Associates did the survey I would like an

  Would it not be fair to say that the relatively few people who have decided
 to purchase  would be inclined to like it  Just as those of us who love OS
 most of the people who but them know more or less what to expect and are not
 disappointed  I mean it is nice to know that the people who bought it are 
 happy and important for MS to know and I don't dispute the accuracy  I just
 would hate to see people extrapolate from that population that DOS  is the
 next computer revolution 

	Well these statistics are to shut people up and add some
	microscopic weight to MS' arguments  As I just said you have

Hello

recently I noticed there is a directory named DiskImage in my disk  I didn't
notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created or if Win automatically created a backup of its files
I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility having an image of
the disk is taking a lot of disk space  Does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed Win did or it is a backup mechanism

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice

First a general description of the machine as follows
 Motherboard Utron  mhz Opti chipset  meg memory kb cache
      soon I hope to drop a DX chip into it
 Fahrenheit  video  meg xx
 ProAudio Spectrum  sound board
 primary disk  Connor CP on a caching IDE controller
 secondary disk  Conner CP as slave on same controller
 tertiary disk  Fujitsu   meg on Superstore ESDI controller
 planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS SCSI port
 Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo  on the Floppy controller
  future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface
 Other hardware includes modemfax serial ports and a teletext board
 ugly dos software drives the latter

Applications used include normal windows stuff excel word Quicken
and Turbo PascalWindows but the important stuff is my Audio
work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows MCS Stereo
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files  Also I use
Stacker on the primary drive HP Newwave for my wife's use and she 
won't let me get rid of it and a product called Infinite Disk from 
Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files  

I plan to upgrade to NT when it becomes a released product  I was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on but I don't have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software  I expect to buy it tear off the 
shrink wrap and use it without hassle I know unrealistic but I can
hope can't I after all I have work to do

The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers and 
hardware specific stuff in general  How smoothly can I expect the 
upgrade to go  Can I expect support for all my stuff or do I
still need to scramble around downloading drivers PAS Orchid Colorado 
from some bbs etc  What steps should I take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system  I'm
allergic to command lines  I plan to run a pure NT system  Also will 
NT communicate with the workgroups lan  What about stacker  I currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive  Without Stacker and the Infinite 
Disk product I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the 
system It's cramped now

I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT but will there be an NT 
version  Or will NT support compression a la Dos   I know Infinite Disk
will be incompatible with NT but will they offer or does anybody else
a comparable product for NT and at what cost  perhaps I need to ask 
Chili Pepper that question  I can live without ID if I have to but I'd
rather not  Will NT run my DOS apps the teletext board mainly without
DOS on the system  What do I need to keep around

Any feedback or advice including forget NT with good reasons is much
appreciated  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better
multitasking environment than Windows among other reasons WAVE locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files
and I want better lan support than I now have Internet access etc  Maybe
there are better solutions than NT and if so I would appreciate hearing 
about them OS  What's it's status these days

Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net

Thanks

Are you sure you want to do that  If a win app locks up for some reason 
ctrlaltdel may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows  
Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion
I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke  Just a

It certainly smacks of that Remember the POLL that you quoted saying that

unbiased the sample set was That post sure looked like FUDand coming
from a microsoftie  well it sure seemed like something was not on level

    If I recall Jen said right up front how the sample set was derived
Where's the FUD


Advocacy is GOOD  but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very 
unethical  especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that
OS

    Does this mean I can flame you if I ever see you doing it
    Face it  the advocacy groups are for the kind of things that
you're preaching against  This is why they were created in the first
place  to filter out all the crap from the newsgroups that might

My original post
Subject Re Why is my mouse so JUMPY  MS MOUSE
 I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom  was using  
 I think but switched to  to see if it was any better  Vertical motion 
 is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
 on something because my mouse jumps around  I can be moving the mouse to 
 the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
 for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
 again maybe this time to the left about  inch  This is crazy  I have 
 never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Aha I think I found the problem and it isn't dirt  Another guy here was 
using a different kind of mouse and was using xx video driver the 
default VGA for Windows  He has an S LocalBus card like I do and when I 
loaded the S video driver in Windows for him his mouse became jumpy too  
Seems like it is the S driver  Is there any newer one than version  
that would solve this problem  It is really bad  I have to use the 
keyboard instead sometimes  The swzip on cica is version  which is 
the same version that came with my card

Why   Do you mean just use smartdrvexe in autoexecbat 

Roger

You answered

Quoting from windowssetuptxt
Under the section for using stacker

For best performance do not use SMARTDrive to cache the
compressed drive You only need to cache the uncompressed drive

Check it out for yourself

I think it is important to clear up your first reply  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker   You are
correct re caching the compressed drive  However as I understand it
you can cache the uncompressed drive  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker  C being
the compressed disk which is just a large file on D and D being the
uncompressed disk  You should only attempt to stack D  In fact with
Win  and smartdrvexe it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your AB and D drives

Less than  of mailorder price

I have three libraries all on CD which cost me over two thousand dollars
mail order  They are all genuine high quality EPS vector graphics NOT just
some scans with a silly EPS wrapper  They are

 Totem Graphics color EPS library about  color EPS images
   This costs a thousand bucks mailorder  I rate this clip art as
   high quality much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art SOTMC clip art
   etc in my opinion but I rate both the G library and the CAR
   library as higher  Totem's art is ALL color  whereas most of the other's
   are BW  It's the best allcolor library out there in my opinion

 CAR Graphics library haven't counted how many images but you can
   purchase the library on  floppies to give you an idea of the size
   This costs about  hundred bucks mailorder  I rate this clip art as
   very high quality but it's only BW

 G Graphics library very popular in all the Mac mags  This costs
   about  hundred bucks mailorder  I rate this clip art as very high quality
   got some awards in one of the major Mac mags forgot which  Some of
   the images are color but most are BW

For what it's worth all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats
They are readable on Mac's and PC's  Additionally Totem's will mount native
NeXT also although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC
filesystems  I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines I've owned
all three machines although I sold my NeXT a few months ago

Also in my opinion the G and CAR libraries are the best in the business
and I've seen lots  Also Totem's is in my opinion the best allcolor
library around although I like G's color art better

I want  for everything  Can ship certified check COD as well as
VISAMC charge  If you pay by VISAMC I'll ship prepaid in the continental US
If I ship COD buyer pays freight and COD fee

Reason for selling No longer have DTP business

Please respond via email or telephone as I rarely check these news groups

How does Print Manager deal with multiple printers  

 We're planning 

to print to two printers from an application  One will be a
real printer and the other a

 fax program 

  Will Print Manager
just deal with the jobs one at a time or will it feed to both
printers at once


Please research carefully  Just because a fax modem behaves like
a printer on a local machine doesn't guarantee functionality 
when a local machine has fax software printing to a remotely
installed fax card  I tried this with Workgroups and the 
fax software didn't like it at all  Could have been WinFAX's
peculiarisms but I don't think so  A lot of special hardware
interaction takes place internally  In my case a FAX manager
program merely intercepts the print job and spools it to
it's own directory not print manager's spool directory  To
software it appears the job was printed  Print Manager 
plays NO part in the handling of the actual process

Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were
up to  A truely networkaware faxmodem will most likely be
required or a lot of weird setup and tinkering

Good luck

 must simply change the path to include CWINMASTR and your

 other stuff delete
If you happen to be running the new msdos  you could use multi

This is the part that usually gets me While I am set to make money there usually
are OTHER things to be considered and debated That is the purpose of life

Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures
of success They can be measures of short term or long term success I think
in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success The original
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS
I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story

I also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call
them are highly technical Look around in the real world people don't want
to GREP and AUCK and ls l they just want to push the buttons and get their 
job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need 
a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc Like it or not MS and the
multitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does
this and does it WELL We are running  pc's loaded with a complete
suite of mostly MS Windows applications in an administrative business
function on a Novell network running all software off the server
It does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick
Windows again

  Hi  One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem  His mouse
works fine in DOS applications if you load them from the C prompt
Under Windows the mouse pointer is present but does not move  Even
if you load a DOS app under Windows the mouse doesn't work

  The computer is a Zeos SX wDiamond Speedstar VGA running MS
DOS  and Windows   Mouse driver is Microsoft's   I've tried
switching the mouse from COM to COM I've tried a different mouse
I've reinstalled MOUSEDRV and I can't get the blamed thing to work
The only difference between his system and mine where the mouse works
perfectly is that he has an expansion card with an additional
parallel and serial port  Could that cause the problem 

  Thanks in advance for any help

In article srgcispudHyperionCOM the author writes
    I am setting up my DOSUNIX box on a M IDE and a M SCSI drive
 and was wondering about the use of the MSDOS  JOIN command  I
 like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C
 D  E crap that DOS enforces  I like how it would mimic mount
 points of UNIX filesystems  I have heard that there were problems
 with using it or at least under older versions of DOS  Please tell

I have been using the JOIN command for many years now mostly with good
success in duplicating unixstyle file mounts  You will hear lots of
people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command
a truely gnarly hack but don't believe them  You also will hear
people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN  But in
Microsoft's Windows  Workgroups Resource toolkit the following appears

  JOIN an MSDOS utility works fine with Windows for Workgroups  if
  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for
  Workgroups  session This includes adding or removing joined drives
  from within Windows for Workgroups We recommend that you do not use
  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 

Within this caveat JOIN appears to be valid under windows  However I
have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems
that have been mounted using join

In particular the worst offender is Word for Windows x  It gets very
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive It
wants to create the saved file as NNNNNtmp in the current dir then
delete the old file and rename the NNNNNtmp file to the doc file

Unfortunately WfW usually writes the NNNNNtmp file in some idiotic
place other than the current directory often in the root dir of the
joined filesystem but not always  Then after deleting the original
doc file it can't find the NNNNNtmp file to rename it  Unless you
search your disk systems the document is gone

I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box
when JOINed filesystems are present  I used to join ctemp with a meg
ramdisk but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an ls on the ctemp
dir and misses some files in the temp dir  This is difficult to 
reproduce but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used  I think
this is a Windows problem rather than MKS's since it works OK under raw
DOS

So I would suggest that you can use JOIN but be aware that it may not
be as robust you would like

Wouldn't it be real great to mount network drives ie Z under the main
file tree rather than having all those darned drive letters Unfortunately
JOIN won't let you do it  There was talk on the net about a simple patch
to let JOIN work on network drives but I don't remember the source

It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented since it would
avoid using all those stupid drive letters  I realize that MessDos was
meant for casual even ignorant users so mounting all the drives in
one file tree might be confusing But it looks like MS is going to carry
this over into windows NT another OS meant for casual even igorant 
users  NOT  With all it's old family system baggage maybe MS needs
a recovery group so they can get on with life

I am running windows  in  enhanced mode  The sound card I have

compatibility

Using Windows MediaPlayer I can play the midi files that came with
my sound card  However I can't play any of the midi files that belong
to the WinJammer midi editor that I ftp'd from cica  I also can't
play any midi files I generate with muzika also from cica  When I
try to play the files a dialog box pops up saying that the music
may not play right and it has a checkbox asking me if i wish to disable
this message in the future

Is this normal or do I have something set wrong  I would really like
to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it

I also ftp'd the game daredream for windows from cica and its music
won't play either  I get the same dialog box

The MIDI Mappers that I have are ATI Ext MIDI ATI OPL MIDI and Vanilla
I have tried using all three

Any help suggestions shoulders to cry on etc would be appreciated
very much

Fill gaps in Dos There's no need for many people  Dos  provides

 Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it 

This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value

I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of MS products do not even know about internet and Unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know And the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors While PC users tend to
customize any windowing setup they can not do much with their 
command line

So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
quality MS has made their life easier and more productive and to them
that is quality They do not care about what innovative things MS has
done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier You may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception

Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to
all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users We here on the net are not mainstream computer users

Currently we are using WinFax software to receivesend fax on our

characters in faxin files and translate them into ASCII code then
store the file in ASCII format

Would you like to tell me
	 whether or not there is such software package to do such
 	    translation 
	 if there is one where can I find it
	 is any such software package on public domain

What version of WinFAX do you have  The newest version  has an OCR
Optical Character Recognition built in what this means is that it can
take a fax ie a letter and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit
the document wo retyping it However I found that the OCR that comes
packaged with WINFAX does not work as well as OMNIpage Professional also
by Delrina software So once again WinFAX ver  has what you are
looking for Good luck

 Go under Ctrl Panel enh and check for all your COM ports 'Alway Warn'
it will help u w debugging this thing and it's 'healthier'  Check where

These might help u If yu still have problems get  and buy ProcommWin

 Finally in order to run your specific version of Windows you

 other stuff delete
If you happen to be running the new msdos  you could use multi

the machine  power up select your name  the menu will use your
personal sections of configsys and autoexecbat thus setting up the
path then running your windows copy

Excellent suggestion Ron  And as a further comment on DOS  if
you decide to install Windows standalone configuration completely
in more than  directory on your hard drive and use DOS  to
jump to a specific copy for each user you could be saving yourself
many megs of disk space if you use the SETUP N and A technique

I posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy  
Well I think I know why and it doesn't have anything to do with the 
mouse  It seems to be the video driver  Here's why I think that

A few weeks ago I helped a guy install the driver for his S video card for 
windows  He had been using the normal Windows default VGA driver  We don't 
have the same kind of mouse mine is microsoft serial and his is an off
brand serial mouse  His mouse worked fine until I installed the S v 
driver on his system then his mouse became really jumpy too

Is there anything I can do  I need high resolution since I display LOTS of 
stuff on my screen AMI Pro Pegasus Mail for Windows WP Office   
sorry nondisclosure and alot more  I noticed there are S drivers on 
ftpcica but they are the same version that I already have and they are no

   that os  beta is available via ftp and I was wondering if anyone knew
   where to obtain a copy  I would appreciate any information as I would like 
   once and for all to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs

If you wait until May the th you will be able to buy the new OS
 since it will be released at Comdex that day It will run Windows
 apps and Windows enh mode If you can't wait then you can ftp a
 months old beta version from ftposnmsuedu but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product

When you do your test please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task The real power of OS
lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch

Happy benchmarking

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges Nobody disputes
that OS has more big OS features The question is Does an 
individual need the power The sales of Windows vs OS answer that
question The next question is even if I did want to run OS
and I had this big monster machine to run it on is there a diverse
set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
work Go to your local computer store to answer this one
I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS This
is where the new battle lines will be drawn Windows  has won
the single user PC war the next one will be the client server
war and the entries are NT OS UNIX and Netware 
Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be
attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'
of the war Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
is fun watching and arguing about it tho

Hello phjm you wrote

 Firstly does Windows  in  enhanced mode do anything special
 with DLLs that have been compiled using the large memory model

No

 We are being told that even in  enhanced mode Windows
 will load DLLs into real memory below K and pagelock it

No

 My second question relates to static data inside DLLs Is there
 any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data
 segment DGROUP

No but

You can allocate real static data within code segments
When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap

You can forget most of what was written about memory management Under 
you have paged virtual memory You can lock every block without hampering
the memory manager You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock
Unlocking the memory block

An besides DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's that happen to be called
by another task

I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of MS products do not even know about internet and Unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know And the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors While PC users tend to
customize any windowing setup they can not do much with their 
command line

You can't customize a command line interface  Where have you been  I
can change the prompt I can make aliases so someone like me who is
used to say ls can type it on my dos machine and still get a
directory listing and under Unix if I don't like the command line
interface I throw it out and get a different one csh bash ksh
sh etc

So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
quality MS has made their life easier and more productive and to them
that is quality They do not care about what innovative things MS has
done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier You may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception

This is true

Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to
all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users We here on the net are not mainstream computer users

A decent GUI for all variations of Unix Lessee what about Motif
Or the stuff from MIT twm comes to mind those are pretty
standard Heck an xwindows program runs like it likes to  all the
end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows
with the mouse and since it is a GUI it's graphical and a bit
easier to figure out Something the windows people have been pressing
down our throats for some time now

The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users
running windows all flavors and the other power users running Unix
and other more advanced OSes At least right now DOS is still pretty
much king I can bring a copy of my latest whizbang programming demo
over to my friends house and since we both run DOS he can enjoy it
too

These are perfectly valid points and I agree I'm glad we MS are starting
to remedy this situation with DOS  and it will get better in future 
releases You do need to be aware of some history however In the 
midlate 's MS's point of view was that OS was going to take over
the world and DOS would be phased out As such resources for DOS
and windows for that matter development were mostly redirected to OS
The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people
until they started using OS so utilities and such for DOS fell by the 
wayside

Then Windows  hit the market OS flopped x at leastx seems to
be doing a little better but its future is still cloudy and people either
stayed with their DOS x and x apps or moved to Windows About that
point in time MS made its decision to drop OS for DOSWindows in the
short term and WindowsNT in the long term DOS  much improved over DOS
x and x was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows
Version  takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will
offer even more in terms of real OS features I work on NT and have no
real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing but I do
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
few years ago

	Dave

Of course these are my opinions If you want MS's opinions as a PR person

Where should I look and what should I change to get the document with
the long table to use the paper drawer rather than kick into manual
feed mode I believe I've tried all the obvious printer manager changes
as well as replacing the hppcllp files with archived versions

PaintShop Pro for Windows is a fantastic product  It can handle TIFF GIF
BMP PCX and many other formats displaying them and converting between
them  There is a shareware version of the program I assume it's available
in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations I'd try
ftpcicaindianaedu  Log in as ftp use your username as a password
and look for a program called PSPexe or something like that  I have
the registered version and the only major difference I can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it

Once again FANTASTIC software  Up to  bits huge images everything

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II K  disk or Apple II

This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file It sure gets
asked enough

NOTE I have been working for MS for the past  years I have been
a developer for the past  OS is technically superior to Windows
Considering that MS makes more money per copy of OS sold than IBM and
we cowrote most of it

Differences between OS  and OS 

 OS  had about half the memory requirements
 OS  was quicker even at half the memory
 OS  was much more stable

Oh and one more thing

 IBM did OS  by themselves

Yes a lot of what OS  has in common with OS x was written by you
guys However many of the things that made OS  so much more successful
WinOS Workplace Shell than previous versions were IBM work

So we cowrote it may be technically accurate but it's really a red herring
as the bits that are selling the product weren't written by you

Don't forget seamless Win apps on OS MS couldn't do it viz WLO
but IBM managed to do it right

WinOS is IBM work You make me laugh Rewriting couple of thousands
lines of code to make Windows compatible with your DPMI implementation does
not make the rest of Windows IBM work

I don't think MS has anything to brag about when it comes to following
DPMI But then consistency is the hobgoblin etc I suppose

RE IrishGaelic TrueType Font wanted  synopsis

I wrote
Can anyone tell me where I can find an MSWindows TrueType font
that will give me the characters used in writing IrishGaelic
in the old style

For example in this font the letter T would look something
like a C with a horizontal bar sitting on the top and the
letter G would look something like an S with a horizontal
bar sitting on the top
 
Many thanks to those who responded to my question  Unfortunately I have
had no luck in actually getting such a font and a lot of people interested
in geting one and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description  This font is based on that used in the  issue of 
Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the 
early part of the century  This may take me some time to do in my
limited spare time but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested 
when it is ready

The responses I received are summerised below

Kevin Donnelly caoimhinsmoacuk mentioned that Michael Everson
eversonirlearnucdie had developed some Clo Gaelach fonts
for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me  I contacted Michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh and
that he will eventually port them to the PC but that he will be charging 
IR  about  for each one

pbryantukeleleGCRCOM mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice IrishGaelic look to them'  These are Durrow and American 
UncialNormal  I don't know where you can get these but I don't
think that they have the effects I am looking for

Finally rhiannonnetcomcom Rhia mentioned that the Meath font
included in the Casady  Greene Fluent Laser Fonts  package
is very much like what I was describing  I faxed Casady  Greene for
info but got no reply

So that's it  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available

IT'S BACK

Congratulations you've just discovered a very nasty and very frequently
ecountered bug in the Word Setup program Once you know what is wrong it
is quite easy to fix Go into the Fonts dialog under Control Panel and select
the two fonts MT Extra and Fences Delete them but only delete the list
entries not the disk files Now select Add and add the fonts MT Extra Plain
and Fences Plain Close the Font box close Control Panel and restart Word
Everything should be alright now

Does anyone know if Microsoft has fixed this thing yet They HAVE to know
about it by now it's been so frequently reported

I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to reinstall
everything from scratch after a crash learned the hard way didn't I
I am using a windowsbased backup program actually Norton and I 
began wondering about the logic of this  Sure if I accidentally delete
a file I can get it from the archive  But what if my disk crashes again
I would not be able to start windows to run the backup program  Note
by crash I mean there was some error message that prevented the machine
from booting properly  I think I gave up too early but I didn't have
the timepatiencetools to figure out exactly what the problem was  My
hard drive needed cleaning up anyway Yeah right  This whole scenario
is complicated by the fact that I am using Stacker

So I think there are  possibilities

    I'm right  If my disk really crashes I would at least have to
      reinstall DOS and Windows to get the backup program working
    I'm wrong  There is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk
      that can easily restore it's state from scratch

Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac disks  
I've never tried it though  Good luck

I just tried it but I can't say that it works 'cause it doesn't read K
disks it only reads Mb If there a program that does read K disks
please let me know


Well you can't say that it don't work  The inability to read k mac
disks is not a SW problem  Rather it's a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs 

I have seen a post about a program able to read nonMb Mac disks
which comes with a watchamacalit ma memory's faling card which you
just drop into a com port or something  Don't remember specifics tho
peace

On all Mb drives both Mac and PC the disk spins at a constant
RPM  On k Mac disk drives the spin rate of the disk is varied so 
that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed a slower rotation
for the outer tracks and a faster rotation for the inner tracks  A PC
needs special controller hardware to make this happen

In the newer versions of Norton Backup for Windows  at least
there is an emergency disk which will allow you to restore
from tape without reinstalling DOSWindows I understand it's sort
of cumbersome to use but not nearly as much as reinstalling
everything

I think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS  
Considering that OS is a multithreaded true multitasking OS and
takes the place of DOS and Windows and more I actually think the 
requirements for OS are very reasoable  I also think that anyone
using Windows  without  megs of RAM a  and  megs of
hard drive space is beating their head against a wall  Those are
also legitimate requirements for OS  In fact the requirements 
for Windows  and OS are about equal

I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my 
hands on PCSolarisUnix for the Intel chip  I know that there
are many of other unix possibilities out there but this includes
the Wabi Windows API Binary InterfaceI think technology that wil
run Windows apps straight outta da box  If this flies in enhanced mode
then here's another contender to look out for in the corporateeducation
market

Too big and complex for the home frontWindows Mac Sys will take those
while WinWkgrps  NT  OS will fight it out for the smalltomid businesses

However once the PowerPC becomes available especially in laptopnotebook form
then these will migrate into all marketsthe ability to connect up to a unix
machine at work and yet still run WindowsMac apps at home is going to be real
attractive to alot of people

Just my predictions

You're right

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II K  disk or Apple II
 disk without extra hardware However Mac MB disks can be read
and written in a PC  HD drive with software only 

This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file It sure gets
asked enough

I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list  But we have
strayed from the original topic  Our computer environment is pretty split
between Mac's and PC's I am lucky and get to have both on my desk  But
there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users
here  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter
which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively  For the PC there
is no equivilant that I know of  Both macette and macsee have been 
inconsistant under the dos platform and requires you to perform the activity
in a DOS program to selectively transport the files

The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
windows like a DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is 
in a PC and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs  It is quite
clear that this would only be available for the MB flopies

My Windows  installation has somehow gone awry  Whenever I try to run
Windows now the logo comes up OK but when it tries to enter Windows
itself the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong
graphics mode or something  It's completely illegible although functional
as I can still exit to DOS with an ALTE RETURN combination

I tried to reinstall Windows again but if you recall halfway through the
installation process install takes you into Windows and there my graphics
problem surfaces again so I cannot complete the reinstallation

All this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my
configsys and autoexecbat have been restored to what they were before
this problem cropped up

I'm running a DX with a Diamond Stealth VRAM I've resinstalled the
Stealth video drivers again but with no luck  I'm also using QEMM and
Stacker  but Windows is installed on an unstacked partition  And of
course it worked perfectly before

Any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated  Thanks

Hutch

So I think there are  possibilities

    I'm right  If my disk really crashes I would at least have to
      reinstall DOS and Windows to get the backup program working

Using the software you're using I agree with you there  What I did
I installed DOS Windows and CPBackup functionally the same
as your Norton for the purposes of this discussion and used the 
DOS backup command on just that much  To restore I boot to the 
system diskette and use DOS restore to read in that much then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB Norton in your
case overwriting what I've just restored  That allows me to keep
this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged with all my customization
on the real copy done using the rdparty backup utility

    I'm wrong  There is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk
      that can easily restore it's state from scratch

Seems possible if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup
utility on a system floppy  Then you could restore it all on one go

It will certainly help to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but
the only way that Solaris or OS or any other scheme is going to 
challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris
or OS or whatever apps down to a DOS competitive level  Everybody
would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS app on
an OS system they usually just can't afford a Unix system because
of the high prices for good Unix software

It's called the free enterprize system I suggests that those who wish to
enhance DOS do it an sell it or give it away Microsoft can't be 
everything to everyone period

It has been done but the other companies don't have the marketing
budgets that MS do  DOS for instance is everything that
COMMANDCOM should have been but never could be under MS  Those who
use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine  But they
have to rely on word of mouth for sales  It seems to have worked
pretty good so far but your corporate weenie manager type usually
likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine  That's okay marketing
isn't a fundamental human right but they've got a product that's
superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way  They have a lot
more to be proud of than MS does  If MS really gave a damn they
could duplicate it buy it outright they've got the money or even
use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with
compatability issues and absconding with the technology

DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch
marketing and vendor agreements  The mediocre was excusable in the
early days when it was someone else's hack but they've had ten years
to play with it

An interesting thought on that Most MS products that I'm aware of in
the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and
programmers through easter egg screens including Windows or at least
have the names buried in the files  Is there such a thing in DOS 
and  or are they too ashamed to have their names on it

The easiest way to do this is if you can send the files accross the network 
This is much easier going from a Mac to a PC because you don't have to worry
about losing the resource fork of the file often a problem when sending binary
files from a PC to a Mac

Yes a lot of what OS  has in common with OS x was written by you
guys However many of the things that made OS  so much more successful
WinOS Workplace Shell than previous versions were IBM work

Yes certainly  It was IBM that wrote the Windows code

Cliff do you know the difference between Windows and WinOS  Here's
a helpful hint

Running Windows under OS  is only possible in real mode in a DOS
box Of course this is only possible with Windows  since Windows 
no longer has a real mode

The ability to run standard mode the ability to have an OS  Windows
clipboard the ability to run seamless and a few other things were all added
by IBM to WinOS

Now everybody who is running Windows in realmode in a DOS box under OS
x raise your hand Finally everybody who is running WinOS under OS
raise YOUR hand

Here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server  
The WinHelp function as I am told by MS does search your path so 
relocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include
the path to where you move them to however if an application has 
hardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it
searches the given path ie WinHelphwnd camipro for example then
WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory
where you have installed your software

I tested this out on a variety of software packages  I moved all my 
helpfiles to the drive z and included this in the path statement
Here is the results for different software packages


Norton Desktop			Found Helpfiles
Windows V for WorkGroups	Found Helpfiles
Windows V			Found Helpfiles
MS Powerpoint V		Found Helpfiles
MS Word				Found Helpfiles
MS Excel Va			Did Not Find Helpfiles strange
MS Foxpro V for Windows	Found Helpfiles
Lotus Amipro V		Did Not Find Helpfiles
Procomm Plus for Windows	Did Not Find Helpfiles


I guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to 
specify a global path for helpfiles  

If anyone has any comments or If I can help anyone or if I left something
out please let me know

 Another comment  At least you have IBM consultants trying to help
 I've never heard of Microsoft sending customer engineers to a
 client's organization to help solve problems  Could be wrong but if
 they do its not common knowledge

Microsoft has a division called Microsoft Consulting that does what
IBM FEs field engineers do

However neither company just up and sends consultants to client sites 
Both companies charge very high hourly rates for onsite consulting unless
the client has already paid an annual service contract

I have just added a Panasonic KPX pin dot matrix printer to a sx I installed
the appropriate Windows  printer driver ie one specifically for this printer but I'm
unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly 
 
What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly My
experiments show that all graphic images for example a line drawing from Corel Draw print
ok GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc MS Notepad and MS Write will
print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts 
 
When I print TrueType fonts some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order If I change 
the text font to a printer font the problem is eliminated
 
I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KXP snappy name emulates
namely Epsom LQ and IBM ProPrinter X and the same problem occurs
 
If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on I would be most 
chuffed

Lotus Organizer  Quick cheap pretty  And has all of those features 
you want 

 A good file manager Microsofts is very poor by my standards 

You might look at one of the shell alternatives provided by third
parties  Norton Desktop for Windows for instance

Personally I like File Manager which comes with Windows  It's much
faster than NDW's and the File Manager that's part of Windows for
Workgroups even has a decent button bar

How
about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations

That first you can do with File Manager but the others you'll need
to look at NDW or PC Tools for Windows etc

as I rarely get to read this group thanks so much

I haven't yet seen a decent freeware or even shareware shell  But
it may be just me

I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over
a week If you do get multiple copies my apologies

Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the
pathetic state of DOS  as an upgrade distribution  it is a long story
but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the
potential pitfalls of upgrading to DOS  that I have been able to
notice after only about a week of playing around with it

My envorinment


TI TravelMate  WinSX SX M Ram M Disk
System BIOS version   by Texas Instruments
CLGD VGA BIOS v  a by Cirrus Logic  Quadtel
Advance Power Manager BATTERYPRO v b by Texas Instruments
Smart Drive Cache WINDOS Parameters   a b
Windows Benchmark WinBenchtm v   by ZD Labs

After updgrading to DOS  I could not understand why certain things
became so slow especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'  In the
process of finding out why I discovered some interesting things


Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive


While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time certain
applications appeared to run very much slower  What was interesting is
that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to
consider them useful by any standards  I suspected Double Space DS
and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBenchtm

The Real Disk WINMARK of  for the original system as shipped from
factory with DOS  and Windowws  became  when upgraded to
DOS  with DS  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of
more than  percent which did not really surprise me because I knew
that DS compression must cost something

Specifically for short sequential reads up to  bytes DS actually
improves transfer rates by about  because CPU being faster than
IO more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings
in IO cycles  However for all other cases particularly large
random writes the transfers take up to three times as long

While the performance depends on the type of access ie random or
sequential small or large transfer units on the average based on
WinBench's assumptions the disk slows down to half its speed

The tests alone done in 'real mode' see WinBench and with smartdrv
on do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective
statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or
even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and
slow disk IO'

This explained why some applications ran markedly slower but not why
'chkdsk' and 'defrag' the latter especially too so long


Double Space and Windows


DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows not even if you
wanted to only to get information not modify anything or for that
matter even check on its usage  try fasthelp dblspace in a dos box
within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you
get  How narrow minded can a programer get I wonder

Yes this information can be obtained through the mstoolsdd addon to
file manager but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed
floppy  Use the DOS  supplement utility to create a compressed
floppy if you dont know how to


DOS  Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM


Defragmentation seemed to take too much time  Even so I waited
patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm
This confirmation 'dblspace def' command for the M drive should take
no more than  seconds much faster on other defragmenters I have used
but it took  minutes

I discovered that if I moved the mouse defragmentation checking ran
faster the  figure ticked more rapidly  It dawned on me that this
had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management APM
module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle
and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process  After
disabling the TI's power saver this operation took only  seconds


Microsft programmers think TI and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots


In the readmetxt file you can find the the following

	Running Microsoft Backup with TI and Gateway NOMAD computers
	
	To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup
	for Windows or MSDOS add a L switch to the DEVICE command in
	your CONFIGSYS that loads the BATTERYPRO file Or before you
	run Microsoft Backup type SETPOWER L at the command prompt

If you checked TI's manual on the L option you will realise that it
means disable all power saving features of your notebook  Why would
anyone want to run a driver disabled  As I have found out not only
does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the
readmetxt claims but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' and who knows what
else are crippled by the TI's power saver

It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications  If
there indeed is such a thing then either Microsoft programmers or TI
programmers dont know how to read these specifications  You dont have
to guess as to who are the idiots

By the way if you run the advance power management utility POWEREXE
in DOS when you check the status it says

	Power Management Status
	
	Setting   ADV MAX
	CPU idle  of time

This figure of  seems to be the steady state value on my notebook
when I am running nothing windows with only program manager in
iconised form  Does that mean that Windows takes up  of my CPU all
for itself and that I have at best only  left for useful work  Is
such an overhead justified  whether or not Windows is an operating
system or just another user interface  In DOS alone it reports 
idle time  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type
of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'
example of our times


Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming


I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of
addpath statements like this

	set PATHCDOS
	
	set PATHCETCBINPATHCBIN
	
	set PATHCETCWINDOWSPATHCWINDOWS
	
	set PATHPATHCBCCBIN
	
	set PATHPATHMOUSE

Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old
one ie cdos DOS  installation program modifes each and every
path statement and prepends CDOS to its value  As a result my
resultant path has so many DOS's

If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path and add
the new DOS path clearly it has to only scan for the path statement
containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path
Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a
directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'

Instead the Microsoft programmer if you can call this person one
decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and
prepend DOS to the value  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it
would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process

I started a thread on this when DOS  came up and the Microsoft
representative in Singapore called me about this poster  In fact he
specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the
information to him as he did not have access to internet

Now that has not changed one bit  In fact if you have a PATH statement
with PATH already in it is it not obvious that the this statement
should not be touched for any reason

As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to
understand batch programming  I had the mouse driver invoked as

	set MOUSECETCMOUSE
	set PATHPATHMOUSE
	loadhigh MOUSEMOUSECOM

Guess what MEMMAKER did  It replaced the last statement with

	LH  CETCMOUSEMOUSECOM

Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its
parameters without touching the rest of the line I do not understand


DOS  Software Quality


DOS  is the only operating system I know in which under normal usage
you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the
commands that come with it

I am deliberately being cryptic about this  I challenge Microsoft to
use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it  If they dont
within a week I will post how you can create this ghost file

Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a
particular command only twice I am sure two dozen Microsoft idiot
programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find
it  that is what I was told how Microsoft tests the quality of
their products

I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to test quality
when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested but
can only be built into the product  No wonder they cannot provide any
form of guarantees on their products not even a decent list of bugs
that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond
repair

Also if you run 'dblspace def' often enough repeatedly when the disk
is fully defragmented you may get errors that was created by the
defragmenters  I got my IOSYS file size error and it got truncated
when I did the chkdsk  This happend only after five successive
defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and
with no new file creation since

Microsft dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you
admit that your DS has bugs and are willing to let us know what we
should watch out for if we have already used DS

Well a few things might help you like the  File Manager better

 To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon
   That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy You
   can drag files between windows to any icon on the tree on the left
   side of the window and to any drive icon This beats your left
   and right window as you can have as many open as you wish instead 
   of just two

 You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking
   on the executable's icon

 You can launch any application and open a document file by double
   clicking on the document file's icon provided you have
   associations set correctly This is easily done with the menus The
   browse capability adds a lot of functionality to  So if you
   name all your text files with txt and point all GIF TIFF etc
   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF this takes care of your
   requirement for text reading and graphics viewing

I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell Setting up
all the associations you need is the way to do it

If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be
pretty good indeed File Manager just needs you to understand how
some things are done

I have written the file manager HFM wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files The  most important operations copy move delete
show the file start a progam navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse This is very
convenient because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed occur in one move For bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated for spreadsheat and database files
I use the view program from PCTOOLS  HFM can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats It does
also present archives from pkzip etc as simulated subdirectorys
This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university 
The drawback of this filemanager is it's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun I use the
program package runzip where run tells its windows companion
schedexe which windows program should be started In this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox The new version 
to be released soon includes a new command for automating this
windows program start
FTP archives for the mentioned programs all these archives have several
mirror sites

How well do they work

Very well indeed  At home a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro I can stretch
an AVI window to x and it will continue to play back smoothly  It drops
a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
one frame update every  seconds  An ISA Graphics was able to do Zoom by
 without any perceptible performance penalty  It is the best performance
I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board which
uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA
bus at any point

Hello Netters

	I recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer
The other day I bought the COMPUTER SHOPPER mag  I was looking through
printer review section and noticed the WINPRINTER  The machine is 
incredibly low priced for all the features it has 

			 dpi
			Meg RAM
			Postscript compatable
			envelope printing

My question is does anyone have one of these or know why the price is so
cheap  I would appricaiate it if someone would pass on their knowledge
on this subject  Thanks alot

Does anyone have any information or better firsthand experience
of the new Epson bubblejet printer  Stylus 

I'm particularly interested in hearing how well it works under Windows
I presume that a special printer driver is required  is it supplied
as standard Is it able to print everything that a standard Postscript
laserprinter could

Actually you fell into the above because you said I believe
If you had used the rest of this post in your previous post
I do not think anyone would have agrued with you



System  easier to learn and use  There have been independent studies to 
           that effect
OS     Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking
NeXTSTep easier to learn use and program More stable multitasking
UNIXX   As easy to learn and use  More stable multitasking


The following three are not the competition for Windows  IMHO of course
System    Does not currently run on Intel boxes
NeXTSTep   Rather expensive should be a competitor to Windows NT not x
UnixX                                                      


With the exception of OS all of the above will require most users
to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that
run under these OS's And basically money speaks louder than anything
else You keep saying More stable multitasking is what you mean
Not Multifinder  GEM  GeoWorks cooperative multitasking but
real honest to goodness prioritized preemptive multitasking

With the prpoer setup all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as
well as MSW machines will amongst themselves so interoperability is not
an issue

Basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for
quite a long time but are still to blind to know it


By this criterion it is inferior  If you have another then perhaps I am
incorrect  Do you pick up the glove


Why pick it up You stated the reasons behind your opinions Stated them in 
a very straightforward though over protective manner And aside from
my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor I think we are in
agreement

Does Tim Glauert agree Let's wait and see

 I agree  No one ever definitively met my challenge only batted around
 semantics  Oh well I guess things did turn out as I expected

 Hmmm  I gave two examples which matched your objective criteria and your
 response was some subjective claptrap about them being 'lame'  You never
 did counter the fact that those examples fit your objective criteria

I repeat  What are they  You mentioned what you tried to present as 
innovative but what NEW concept was brought to market  An efficient 
BASIC  BASIC existed before and efficiency is not original either
OLE  What new concept does that bring  Document oriented computing
The Mac had that before MSW  You simply haven't made your point the
burden of proof is upon you

My EXACT challenge What NEW COMPUTING CONCEPT has MS brought to
market first  Nothing more nothing less  Explain how your examples
fit that criterion

Hmmhas anyone of us computer geeks me included ever consider
that inovation is not limited to softwarehardware  True MS
products do not boast features that MS invented but how many products
out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in
their continuing development 

I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing
It is true the XWindowsMACNEXT all have some features in thier GUI
that are better than MS  But people like me can't afford them
It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models
but they are just thatlow end  System  is a better operating
system but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for
my tastesA UNIX platform is powerful enuf but tell the common
user to set up Xdefault i am still confused on what some of them things 
do and they either puke or faint  

If u think about it low prices aint innovative if u come down to it  But
for the product it offers and on the lower cost and powerful hardware
that it runs on as compare to macsMS is kinda innovative

Oh yea I guess the fact that the support products and applications
they have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too

I have a  VLB machine with a Wang  faxmodem
When using the windows terminal application the only way
I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM
then go back and change it to COM  Then it works fine
I have it set to COM as the port to use  I don't have
anything plugged into COM and I've looked over the manual
for all it's worth but what am I missing  The modem is 
jumpered for COMIRQ which I understand means I can't
use the second serial port and the modem at the same time
but I'm not using the second serial port anyway
Also when using Procomm  for DOS it always sees the modem
and dials but doesn't always connect me when the other end
answers  Don't know if that helps any

When I start Windows the first  times I try to run an application it does
not start Windows will show the following error message

   Error Executing application There is not enough memory to run the    
   application

After the first  tries the application I want to run will start and 
afterwards there are no more problems When I change the Video driver from 
Mach  to a this problem does not occur so I suspect the ATI 
drivers I tried both the build  and build  driver

Does anyone have a clue

OK now you are starting to define your criteria

 By this criterion it is inferior

I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that  You have shown that some
aspects of MSW are technically inferior to other systems  As I said
earlier if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true
But some aspects of MSW are actually technically superior to each of the
other systems resource requirements performace device support printer
support GUI etc

 BTW I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIXX is as easy to
  learn as Windows 

But I might even agree that on balance MSW is technically inferior to
some of the competition This still does not prove your point

  If you have another then perhaps I am incorrect

Range of available applications Base OS cost Cost of applications Cost
of hardware Multiplatform support  Quality of the aftersales service
Availability of bookstraining materials Support for visual and physical
handicaps  Suitability for use in mobile computing Quality of
Documentation

If you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on
an OS or indeed the primary factor you need to think again

meg RAM and an Adaptec b with bios enabled System runs fine and runs 
Windows in standard mode fine but it returns to the DOS prompt when trying 
to run  mode I've tried EMMExclude and SysROMBreakPoint What gives

Thanks in advance Hal

     There's one thing about Windows that really frosts me
I have MB of RAM installed in my system I use a MB MB
under Windows diskcache and a MB permanent swap file

     While I can never fill the memory up I still have problems
sometimes because I run out of GDI resources What gives
I think Windows could manage these resources a little better

Are you using Windows  or  If you're still on   devotes about
twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently If 
you might use one of the resource monitors such as the one that comes with
the Windows  Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available
to see which programs are hogging the resources every icon internal
graphics brush etc in every program running uses a certain amount of
this limited memory area Also some don't give it back when they're
finished

 Is there any FTP site that carries WinBench results for different graphics

 how do they differ Is the source available and has anybody try to port it to
 XWindow at least in a way that will make comparisons possible
 
On ftpcicaindianaedu in pubpcwinmiscwinadvzip is a writeup by
Steve Gibson of InfoWorld with winbench  and a number of other 
benchmark results for nine isa and four VLB video cards  This is a 
very current upload and is likely to have any card you're currently

 Hi
 I wonder if anyone has had a chance try out Norton Desktop for Windows
 version  yet I understand the upgrade cost from  to  is about
  but I have no idea what the new version has
  
I got the offer to upgrade this weekend It's    shipping and
handling The SH seem way too steep for just a couple of disks Sounds
like ripoff city Can this purchased at vendors

With my limited knowladge about the PC Geos I came out with following

                                                      running under UNIXWare


 can run unix    nop        I have not     nop     yap
                              heard of it
                                              
                                Try MKS     MKS 
                                           others esp
                                              EMX

Note here the MKS toolkit for DOSWindows  OS gives you a good
suite of standard UNIX utilities  There are other similar systems from
other vendors as well  The EMX system for OS gives you most of the
standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under
OS  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs
directly in either case but EMX makes OS almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other  And best of
all EMX is free  

There is a similar system GO for DOS but it doesn't work with
Windows as far as I know

 price                                  frees
                                                     A good one
                                                     costs  
                                                     avaliable on Ext
                                                     card too

Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point  Neither OS nor UNIX requires
DOS

BTW two of the best unices I've seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare 
for the personal edition and LINUX free  So I don't agree that a
good one costs   

And if you really want to check out the various options available to
you you should also look into DESQview and DESQviewX

Apparently not Many people complain about the confusion that
results from the filemanagerprogman split It's just a basic

Well you may think that but you are wrong

Ah The joys of networking I just hope that you forgot the 

If you don't like the file manager DON'T use it

I don't I use NDW

I like the more modular nature of Windoze

If you like things to be modular I think you would love System 
Instead of adding a line to your autoexecbat you just drop the
icon into the extensions folder

system below the level of the GUI

I'm still working on that one

  Win has a fixed limit of K GDI memory regardless of physical RAM
installed this is twice that of Win but not nearly robust enough for
many developers and power users
 
Using Amish Launch as your shell you can reduce GDI memory usage by as
much as  over Progman NDW  DAshboard and other graphical type icon
based and other shells  Also nesting and full hotkey global support
is offered something no other shells have at this time

  I've just bought a PC which came with a bundle of Lotus stuff including
  Adobe Type Manager version  As a newcomer to Windows I'm
  confused about which I should be using ATM or Truetype 
 
 If you are going to stay with ATM be sure to upgrade to  which
 replaces  Who knows how old  is   is as fast as TT and if
 you disable the small screen fonts ATM does better screen rendering at
 the smaller point sizes

Not true Both Type  and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality
at any size It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs
related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed Probably the reason
for your opinionexperience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the
market today have been converted from Type  outlines to TT either by the font
vendor or endusers using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being
handhinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language At best these converted
TT fonts will be on a par with the Type  font of its orgin

TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type  the hinting
of diagonals for instance which TT does and Type  cannot If you check out the
Windows  core fonts Times Arial Courier Symbol Wingdings you'll see what can
be done with TT There are other fonts out there that have been handhinted and not
just converted Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack  fonts are hinted very well

 You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time if you like
 ATM Type  fonts tend to be of higher quality
 and be more complete in terms of foreign characters

Again not true The characters in a TT or Type  font depend on the maker If someone
converts a Type  font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin TT
allows for much more flexibility in this area as well You can have thousands of glyphs
in a TT font file MacPSWindowsUnicode char set and use the characters appropriate
for the particular platform you are running the font on For instance all or our fontpack
 TT fonts have the MacWindows char set in them The metrics of the fonts are such that
if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set

     Don't bother if you have CPBackup or Fastback  They all offer options

This list appears to imply that MSwindows that has a cost listed
above at  comes with a C compiler C and Fortran It does not of
course These are expensive addons that drive the price WAY beyond 
 I don't know if the same applies to OS 

As far as unix is concerned
There is a free unix linux that has cc c fortran  fc 
Xwindows and many other features besides with a large number of utilities
that can be optionally added And there is also a free BSD I believe
Both these unix's are quite robust You can check out composlinux

If you don't want to throw our many down the tubes you've got to break
that list down a little more

 Stuff del'd for bandwidth's sake

Why  sigh  If you don't have more than MBs of memory using a RAMDrive
with windows is a waste of memory  Windows will access upto MB RAM better
as memory  As to why what you did didn't work it is because driveletters
and paths are stored inside the grouppifini files  All of the sudden things
went from drive c to drive e  However if you wanted to copy an application
up to the RAMDrive and resetup it up that should work normally but as
previously stated this will only hurt things unless you've got more than MBs
of RAM and are using whats above  as the RAMDrive

I personally have MB's of RAM and run a MB RAMDrive with a great deal of
success  However if you are looking to speed up windows the three things
I've noted that work the best are
	 A graphics accellerator card
	 A coprocessor Even an emulator helps
	 Some other diskcache besides Smartdrive I've tried several
	   and Lightning for Windows and Norton Cache give me major
	   headaches as well

I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the
SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup  It's like
it's trying to it's bit in wearing the damn drive out  I estimate it's only
reading a Mb of programs  data but from the performance the drive gives it
sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however
regularily compressed  What is it that takes so much fuss  Perhaps if MS 
would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would 
be wanting to find a solution themselves

please respond to internet mail raymakerbcmtmcedu
thanks


I believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on 
ftpcicaindianaedu
in pubpcwinnt called something like nwntzip

There is an INDEX ascii file there which lists the programs in that directory
and what they do

unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcpip over your
primary nic so if you really want to run it get yourself an extra nic and
bind it to that  

Otherwise wait for next release like I am

Windows Shareware Monthly WSM is an online forum for information about the
newest and best Windows x and NT sharewarefreeware software 

WSM is a compilation of submissions from sharewarefreeware authors in a single
Windows HLP Help System file  All types of software may be submitted for
entry in WSM  utilities applications games programming tools etc

WSM benefits Windows sharewarefreeware authors by allowing them to publicize
their software releases inform users of updated versions and to increase
their installed base of users  Those searching for specific Windows software
will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their
fingertips  complete with feature lists current prices and any other
relevant information

Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the
following manner

 Compose a short summary of the function of the software  Include all
   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart
   from other programs in the genre  Be sure to include specific details
   such as the current release version where the software is available
   how much the registration fee costs how much disk space is required any
   special requirements eg sound card or VBRUNDLL etc how the
   author may be contacted etc  Because text is highly compressible the
   summary may be as long as is necessary however it is best to keep it
   short  A good guideline is a single screenful of point text at x
   resolution  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired
   All submissions whould be in plain text ASCII format  Formatting will
   be exactly as it is submitted  I will simply cut and paste text files
   into a Help Authoring system  If you require special formatting 
   conventions  such as boldface text or italics or a larger font size
   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file  For best results use Windows
   NotePad to create the TXT file 
 
 Include up to k of Windowsformat BMP bitmap screenshots which
   display the workings or special features of each program  Special cases
   rendering applications for example which require color bitmaps may
   submit up to k of BMP files  all other should observe the k limit
   and use color format  For maximum compatiblity with the software which
   will be used to create the WSM HLP file Stefan Olson's Help Writer's
   Assistant for Windows please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or
   WinGIF 

 Include a color BMP of the program's icon ICO file  Many programs
   are available to convert ICO to BMP format or Windows Paintbrush may be
   used  The BMP will be embedded in the summary text

 Doublecheck for spelling errors formatting corrections etc  

 Compress the TXT file the BMP of the program icon and any additional
   BMPs into a single file using PKZIP any version

 Submit the entry by UUENCODING the ZIPfile and emailing it to
   
   DAATAMUTSTAMUEDU

   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve If submitting via America
   Online send a brief message indicating submission and append the ZIP
   file then email to

   DiegoAA

 If any changes are required or a new version is released complete
   the above procedures again  Send all submissions to the TAMUTS address
   and any comments suggestions criticisms to DAARIGELTAMUEDU

All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent
edition of WSM  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors and
we reserve the right to make changes to the entries

WSM is not limited to sharewarefreeware software  A special area will be
devoted to commercially available Windows x and NT software  Commercial
software authors should follow the same steps above with the exception of
the limitations on size  the TXT file and BMPs may be as large as required
and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines  There
is no charge for the publishing of either sharewarefreeware or commercial
product entries  

Advertisements for computer hardware software bulletin boards etc may
be submitted as well Again the same procedures apply with the exception of
the size limitations  There is no charge for advertising space  The first
ten advertisements submitted each month will be included subsequent
submissions will not be included due to size constraints

WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author
columns within WSM  A CC programing section a Visual Basic section and
two Windowsspecific opinionadvice columns are envisioned  All work will
be on a voluntary basis  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column
on one of the above topics please send us mail at DAATAMUTSTAMUEDU or
DiegoAA on America Online
 
The first edition of WSM will be distributed May st via America Online
Compuserve and the Internet  The deadline for submissions is April th
The first edition filename will be WSMZIP with each subsequent monthly
release continuing in the series naming convention WSMZIP etc  Each
edition will be released on the first of each month and the deadline for
submission will be at least three days before release

	Again not true The characters in a TT or Type  font depend on the 
	maker If someone converts a Type  font to TT they'll only get the
	characters in the font of orgin TT allows for much more flexibility
	in this area as well You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font
	file MacPSWindowsUnicode char set and use the characters
	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on

Well yes both Type  and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters
And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI
in Windows and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac 
No difference there between T and TT   

And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing  Reason is that a font with  characters
is very large and if you can only access  of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage  And at the moment there
is only one program of that uses partial font downloading'

	For instance all or our fontpack  TT fonts have the MacWindows
	char set in them The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font
	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac
	char set 	

Yes and T text fonts all have the ISO Adobe' character set which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding

The question is whether you can get at the glyphs  In Windows for example
you cannot get at the ligatures fi' anfd fl' both T and TTeven though a
font may very well have them

ANd while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type  font and to create a
new Windows metric file PFM for it there are utilities out there to allow
you do this  How do I reencode a TrueType font  How can I get at the
fi' and fl' ligatures in Windows or on the Mac  Are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hardwired Windows ANSI encoding

This is an official RFD for the creation of a new newsgroup for the
general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS

NAME COMPDATABASESACCESS

MODERATION UNMODERATED At this time no need for a moderator has been
assertained Future evaluation will determine if one is needed

PURPOSE 
Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System It includes WYSIWYG
design tools for easy creation of tables reports forms and queries and a
database programming language called Access Basic
THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's 
WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
Access Basic to create complex databases

RATIONALE
Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS it is very popular because of its Graphical
Development enviroment and its initial low price
Been a version  product means that all Access users are Novices
For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss 
their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions

I've just bought a PC which came with a bundle of Lotus stuff including
Adobe Type Manager version  As a newcomer to Windows I'm
confused about which I should be using ATM or Truetype 

 

There is a program called trueeffects for windows that allows you to define
attributes for truetype fonts and have them look like new fonts  It will
give your font different backgrounds or shadows or reverse etc

It ONLY works with TT fonts

Yes and the idea was ripped off from Adobe which has had a program
called  TypeAlign for a few years now  TypeAlign does the same thing
for Adobe Type  fonts and Adobe has said that the next version
will work with both Adobe Type  and TrueType

And TypeAlign does some things that TrueEffects does not  including
some things you apparently want 

If you want to use it you best not want to use it with an ATM type font

Oh yeah lest you think this is a really cool program none of the 
effects are scalable  like the brick background pattern is the same size
whether your font is  point of  point and it is not extensible
IE you CAN NOT add pattern of your own
And you can't rorate the background pattern
And you can't make the pattern extend beyond one character
	Every character in that new font has the entire pattern in it
	As opposed to having the SAME pattern run contiguously through
	a couple of characters

It is however cheap
Maybe I will buy a copy when the next version comes out if they fix some of
these gripes

I am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and I
have a few question about Microsoft's Office Pack  

  I was wondering are the programs that are packaged with the Office
PackWinWord Power Point Excel and ccMailcomplete and the latest
addition

 Are the programs hobbled in any way 

 Can we update single programs at a latter date  ie from Excel  to
Excel  

 Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation

 Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package
less of deal that it seems

Sorry if I seem skeptical put the price for the Office Package on the
streetsounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first
computer and software  But all four complete programs for less than 
makes me just a little suspicious  Maybe its just me  

Thanks for your help in advance

 Hello
 
 I recently tried to print some envelopes using AmiPro  with my
 Deskjet  printer and I seem to be having a problem  What
 happens is after I physically load the envelope into the printer
 per the user manual and then select the Print Envelope icon
 from AmiPro all of the proper options have been selected the
 printer just spits out the envelope without any printing of
 either a return address or the selected mailing address  At
 this point the printer's ONLINE light begins to flash and
 the Print Manager shows the printer job as busy  This is all
 that happens until I either shut the printer off or cancel the
 printing job from the Print Manager  I have also tried this
 without the use of the Print Manager with similar results 
 AmiPro shows the printer as being busy  So does anybody
 have any ideasolution regarding this problem  I appreciate
 the help  Thanks

Yes  ignore the manual  Just insert the evelope  don't use the keypad
to move it up  The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that
tells it to load the envelope  if it is already loaded it gets ejected
and the printer tries to load another  The instructions in the manual
are for dumb DOS apps that don't send the load envelople message

Be very careful with these results  As I recall numbers from Winbench

However to answer Stephen's question replacing the Ahead B card with
a Diamond x will yield a costeffective dramatic speed increase for
Windows  That or the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus

to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his
InfoWorld column the past couple of month  In short virtually
every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the
driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the
WinBench suite  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to
how cards stack up on real world tasks

In the last PCMagazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators
and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench  Interestingly
they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour caching for bitblt
operations no matter how unreal yet did not allow a couple of other
types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used  At least
one card was eliminated from the Editor's Choice because of
cheating on the benchmark

I have one thing to say why does everyone say that spliting them up is
such a bad thing  I actually like my program launcher and file manager
do be seperate it make things easier to figure out I mean take a look 
at OS's wps no flames I personally hate it cause I just
have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy

Ok so if everyone is cheating is there any tests that run some 
macro to load a huge drawing etc on the SAME machine that might 
then tell us what the REAL world results are

I mean run the tests on the same machine with different video cards
running word excel or something like that to see how fast the cards are

COM and COM are being used to support two  hour bbs lines

There you go  COM and COM use the same IRQ therefore you can't use
a mouse on COM and a modem on COM or vice versa  It's a limitation
of DOS

And in fact Windows will not see a mouse on anything other than COM
or COM  Accept this fact and either get a bus mouse or get a new
computer

I would also like to know if it is possible to use the mouse on ports other
than COM or COM 

No  The advice above applies

Hi

	I'm having a problem with AMIPro when writing equations  If the
equation extends past a certain point on a line the whole thing disappears
If I then try to delete the equation or cursor beyond the equation AMI
goes nuts  The line counter at the bottom of the screen increments
repeatedly and the only way out is to CTRLATLDEL  If I have been
unfortunate enough to save a document with one of these screwed up
equations the document is basically trashed  although I have been
able to fix them by going into an ascii editor and deleteing large
chunks of the document

	Has anyone else experienced this  Does Lotus know about it
and or have a patch

Thanks in advance

Kurt
nagelfidocoloradoedu

I contacted Lotus about this problem today  It has been reported previously
and there is a fix  Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters
are used immediately preceding the equation frame  The work around when
equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one
preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame or use set frame where
placed wno text wrap around  Unforutnately once the page runon has
occured you are hosed So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters
to align equation frames

Hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this 
problem

I don't believe IRQ is the problem I tried a mouse on COM IRQ the
usual place and it still did not like it Simply Windows seems to only
support mice on COM or COM The funny part is though that
Microsoft's own mouse driver xx was quite happy with my mouse
sitting on COM Why can't Windows use the mouse driver or at least
support COM 

 COMIrq
 COMIrq
 COMIrq
 MaxComPort

I've tried this too Actually I wanted to be able to use my second
modem COMIRQ from Windows It still will not talk to that modem I
created two profiles AMSTRAD for my Amstrad modem on COMIRQ and
MAESTRO for my Maestro on COMIRQ It will not talk to the Maestro
at all

  that their driver does not support COM and COM in windows
 Their suggestion was that the 'MicroSoft or PS' setting in windows
 setup would work It does not

Nor here Windows 

 I can not believe that it is not possible At worst you would need a special
 version of 'a' mouse driver that looked at COM and COM instead of COM
 and COM I know that IRQ and IRQ are normally printer port IRQs but I

I've seen nothing like that I've experimented with Logitech's mouse
driver too with no sucess

 have no printers attached A side note is that I would really like to assign
 COM to some higher IRQ because my SoundBlaster board uses IRQ right now
 I'm not using COM but no modem that I know of allows settings other than
 IRQs  and 

If you have a SoundBlaster Pro it should support IRQ as well
Finally a board that supports IRQs  The only one I have except my
IDE controller

We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms 
For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOSWindows The department has   
always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC since it requires a      
filter to strip out the LF characters                                        

Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate and as   
a result the  programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   
at the end of each week so that a new system could be build We are now trying  
to streamline this process but are hampered by the lack of software that will  
allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms                            

I understand that PVCS used to do this but that they no longer support the MAC 
product anyone know why   Polytron                                        

I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms so I assume that
ours is not a new problem  Who has had to deal with it   What solutions have

In composmswindowsmisc you write

While reading through the DOS  book it states that the Windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive  To make things compatable
I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade  However when all the dust settled and I go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the Windows directory  My question is  How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesn't

you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one but here is my best
explanation  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base

The permenant swap file is readwritten to by windows by talking
directly to the hard disk controller card  The controller card must
use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that
Windows creates a file called spartpar in your windows directory that
points to that file  It then uses the physical information about your
disk to index to information in that file

compressed disks are actually logical disks  These disks have different
characteristics than the actual physical disk  Furthermore the information
on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used  ie it must
go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating
system level or the BIOS level  Because of this inbetween program windows
cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk

a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that
windows can use and to block that space from DOS  Windows would theoretically
not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space I don't
know if it does or doesn'tbut it checks for it somewhere everytime you
boot windows

a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows
via DOS and the BIOS  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded
the file access must go through DOSTSR'S disk compressionand BIOS in
order to be access ie NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILENEVER

more on permenent swap files

i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk
has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested
sizewindows will only use the size suggesteddo you wan't to create this
swap file anyway or something like that

well a friend of mine ROBERT called microsoft and asked them what and why
what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and
divides that number by   Then it checks for the largest contiguous block
of free disk space  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers

They also said that under absolutely no circumstancesNONEwill windows
uses a swap file larger than the suggested size  Wellthat's what he 
said

I call bull  If this is true why does windows report the memory is
available to me if it's not going to use it

any takers

James

if this doesn't get to the net will someone post it for me  thanks

I know the nameserver is correct and the router is correct  They work  
fine using NCSA telnetftp

They are working ok but your definitions in QVTNETINI and QVTHOSTRC are
incorrect see below

The docs said if you are running concurrent packet software you need to  
load PKTMUX  Does this apply to me

No I don't think so You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently aren't
you They use different packet types so QVTNET TCPIP and NOVELL IPXSPX
should be able to coexist just fine PKTMUX is required if you are using
different TCPIPPackages concurrently

This is the qvthostrc file



There is the first problem You didn't specify hostnames just IPAddresses
Your file should look like this

        Name of your Nameserver
     Name of your Router

This is the beginning of the winqvtini file
net
nameswartzjhtestrosehulmanedu

Here you should only specify your hostname without the domain part

router

Instead use routerName of your Router as specified in your QVTHOSTRC
I know the release notes for  say that IP addresses should work also
but  apparently they don't

nameserver

Here too you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the
IP address

It worked fine for me that way although I could not specify more than
one nameserver The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to
three nameservers separated by commas but it didn't work

Hope it helps

I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language
characters in this case Norwegian I have been manipulating the data
with Excell  and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable
files to an RS workstation  The Norwegian characters show up fine
under Windows but appear as funny characters on the workstation  The
workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem
entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard 
On further investigation I found that the character codes used by
Windows are different for these characters than those specified by the
MSDOS code page  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the
workstation  What gives and how can get around it
Please reply by Email as I will be out of the office the next few days

Hello
	I'm having problems printing SPANISH characters with WFW  I was using the Celtic True type which has the accented characters and used insert symbol to put in in the document  However when I put it in the doc I get a big square character and then it prints out just the same to my dismay thinking that was just the way it worked
Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters  I know WP  has this builtin but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW  HELP

There's a package called Workspace on cica that has  desktops I
haven't done much with it yet but it seems to be able to do what you
want it to

Don't have the exact archive name handy but it's something like

This is the nd Reguest for Discussion  RFD  for the creation of 
compdatabasesmsaccess 

The discussion period started on April  and it will last until April 
  days 

This is an official RFD for the creation of a new newsgroup for the
general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS

NAME COMPDATABASESMSACCESS

MODERATION UNMODERATED At this time no need for a moderator has been
assertained Future evaluation will determine if one is needed

PURPOSE 
Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System It includes WYSIWYG
design tools for easy creation of tables reports forms and queries and a
database programming language called Access Basic
THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's 
WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
Access Basic to create complex databases

RATIONALE
Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS it is very popular because of its Graphical
Development enviroment and its initial low price
Been a version  product means that all Access users are Novices
For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss 
their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions

	I'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows
common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app

	Basically I have several DOS apps that I use now and then
with different files  They all accept a file as a command line 
parameter but the only way at least that I know of to do this
easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so
that it prompts me for additional parameters at which point I type 
in the file name  

Problems are

	 Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it
would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the
file manager
	
    and  I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried 
several directory levels deep

	If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some
other way to handle this I'd appreciate it

Thanks

Tim

My understanding is that to copy files from one directory to another on  
the same drive in File Manager using a mouse you hold down the CTRL key  
while dragging the file from one directory's window to the other  This  
works for me about  of the time  The other  the file gets  
moved rather than copied  Anybody else encountered this


I tried to respond by email but all attempts bounced

The condition of the Ctrl key BEFORE you press the mouse button makes no
difference whatsoever  You have to be holding the Ctrl key when you
RELEASE the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation

Here's a simple experiment  Select a file and begin to drag it no Ctrl
key  Notice that the file's icon disappears from the listing window  Now
watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the Ctrl key
keeping the mouse button pressed all the while  In addition the icon
that you are dragging will show a  while you are holding the Ctrl key
indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved

Hello
  
  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework  I have
come across a few that look good

  Zapp  from Inmark
  Zinc  from Zinc software
  CViews from Liant
  Win from Blaise

Some considerations I'm using

  Being new to Windows programming I'm from the UNIXX world the quality and
intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very 
important  However since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows
programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with
the native one  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the
sake of changing the API are valuable

  Since we will be developing for the bit Windows NT system the
memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows  API are less
important 

  We will probably buy another C class library something like Toolsh or Booch
components from Rational to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff
 allocators etc  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have

The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc they seem to be the two
toolkits that have received the most attention from the media  I was wondering if
anyone had any firsthand experience with any of these toolkits especially ZApp and Zinc

A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are

ZApp

  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and
    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes
  Has new fancy Dstyle controls available and support for custom controls
  Has a Windows NT version Essential
  Redirectable graphics displayoutput architecture useful for printing
  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize
  Seems to be the newcomer this could be an advantage in designing a better system
 
Zinc

  Has a platform independent resource strategy  Not too important for me right now
  Comes with a interface builder tool
  Has a Windows NT version Essential
  Seems to have been around longer more mature but grew up out of a DOS version  
  Had a better demo 

Both have source code availability options
Both are lacking OLE support
Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff


Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated

Thanks

more on permenent swap files

i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk
has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested
sizewindows will only use the size suggesteddo you wan't to create this
swap file anyway or something like that

well a friend of mine ROBERT called microsoft and asked them what and why
what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and
divides that number by   Then it checks for the largest contiguous block
of free disk space  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers

They also said that under absolutely no circumstancesNONEwill windows
uses a swap file larger than the suggested size  Wellthat's what he 
said

I call bull  If this is true why does windows report the memory is
available to me if it's not going to use it

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space
limit with the virtual address space limit  As far as the disk is
concerned you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space
The limit that causes the message Windows will only use  is the
amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will
create and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have
when Windows starts

In the enh section of SYSTEMINI you can specify a parameter

	PageOverCommitmultiplier

The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit

	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of
	linear address space the VMM will create for the system which is
	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to
	the nearest  MB and then multiplying that value by the value
	specified for PageOverCommit  Increasing this value increases the
	amount of available linear address space causing the size of data
	structures to increase  This also increases paging activity
	proportionately and can slow down the system  You can specify a
	value between  and   The default is   To change this entry
	you must edit SYSTEMINI

Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System  Unline Win it does not 
run on top of DOS  It is its own OS with Billy Gates assures us true 
multitaskingmultithreading meets DOD security specs will run win 
programs as well as DOS programs has multiprocessor support and is
primarily a Server program  It's overhead is too high for it to be
economical for most users
	Speaking of overhead it requires at least a  with  megs of RAM  
It iwll run with  but that's like running OS  with  megs  And that's 
just to run it  Also I have heard that the system files take up  Megs 
and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig  The SKD is distributed 
on CDROM

Chicogo is what I want to use  It is like NT a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements 
and does not meet DOD security specs but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS  there are a few otehr differences but those are the 
main ones  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Microoft are in intense 
competition so it is said  However I think a different relationship will 
arise NT will be the server Netowrk Techonology Chicogo will be the 
client machine  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT think of it that way anyway  
Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS so don't
scorn the concept
	Anyway don't expect it soon  Windows  and DOS  are supposed to be 
released next year read see it in  so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '
	With luck I'll be proven wrong

more on permenent swap files

i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk
has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested
sizewindows will only use the size suggesteddo you wan't to create this
swap file anyway or something like that

well a friend of mine ROBERT called microsoft and asked them what and why
what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and
divides that number by   Then it checks for the largest contiguous block
of free disk space  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers

They also said that under absolutely no circumstancesNONEwill windows
uses a swap file larger than the suggested size  Wellthat's what he 
said

I call bull  If this is true why does windows report the memory is
available to me if it's not going to use it

any takers

James

Well someone at Microsoft told you wrong  Windows will use a swap file
larger than the recommended size  Last summer I went to a Microsoft
Windows  Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information
that the general public might not be aware of  Anyway in the main book
they handed out they have a section on Creating larger than recommended
swapfile  I'll quote the information

  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size you
  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything
  larger than the recommended size  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT we
  will allow the use of the larger swapfile up to four times the amount
  of RAM on your machine

So as you see Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect  You
probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only
telling you what little he knew

Be that what it may I would really suggest to everyone to take the
opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops  They aren't actually
incredibly indepth but you do get a lot of material about bugs and
optimization straight from those in the know  Besides that they offer
you HUGE discounts on software  If I remember correctly you could pick
up Word  Excel  or whatever their presentation program is for 
That is the full blown version not an upgrade or educational version  You
could also pick up Microsoft Office for  or something like that  Myself
I sprang for Word

Well hope that was helpful to someone  And besides that I hope someone
will go to a workshop and save a little money

And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this  I really love your products
I need a job once I graduate also can we work something out  

Thanks

I wonder if anyone can tell me whether or not I can create a bitmap
of any size  I followed the bitmap creation example in SDK manual
and specified a x bitmap set the widthheight to  and supplied
a byte string with  chars  But I just cannot get the right bitmap
image  I changed the widthheight to x and used the same value
string padded with zero byets to make up to the right size and
got the image

The example in the manual is x size which are multiple of  bytes
Can you define a bitmap image of any size

Thanks very much

This is of course not true  The temporary swap file is purged
every time you exit windows  The permanent file is permanent and

I suspect that either the original poster was tinkering and
adjusted the swap file to MB and then forgot about it or

When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about
 megs of swap file space my  meg HD was nearly empty at that time
I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded now my HD is nearly full
and windows just took  megs
I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your
permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size  I have  megs
of RAM and windows took  meg perm swap file  Works very well
In fact with my available HD space about  megs it won't let me make
the swap file any bigger
You should change your virtual mem swap file to  megs I think
that is what you said your RAM was

We have heard many bad things about the ATI Ultra Plus card mainly having
to do with its buggy Windows drivers

I would like to replace by ATI Graphics Ultra with a truecolour accelerated
card I was about to buy the ATI Ultra Plus EISA but it has had so much
bad press that I am reconsidering


I would like an accelerated card
             a card that does bit true colour at x at least
             a card that does x at  colours or more
             a card that has fast polygon fills
             a card that has fast bit blits
             a card that has a robust windows driver
             a card that has high speed noninterlaced refresh

Any suggestions

My app requires lots of d poly grahics and complexing true colour
imaging  I would sure like a faster solution that what I have now

  What is Windows NT  a 'real' windows OS
 
  This past weekend a local 'hacker' radio show metioned a new product

That is it 
 
Thanks a heap
 
 Alan

Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System  Unline Win it does not 
run on top of DOS  It is its own OS with Billy Gates assures us true 
multitaskingmultithreading meets DOD security specs will run win 
programs as well as DOS programs has multiprocessor support and is
primarily a Server program  It's overhead is too high for it to be
economical for most users

It also runs OS character based apps and POSIX apps  The DOS bit
and  bit windows apps run in a windows  bit subsystem

If you consider the fact that NT has
 the Lanman redirectors
 built in support for TCPIP
 built in support for NETBEUI
 comes with TCP utils like ping and an ftp client etc
 applications like schedule and a  bit version of msmail

the storage argument isnt an issue

        Speaking of overhead it requires at least a  with  megs of RAM  
It iwll run with  but that's like running OS  with  megs  And that's 
just to run it  Also I have heard that the system files take up  Megs 
and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig  The SKD is distributed 
on CDROM


I ran it on a  with MRAM and it did a ton of disk swapping with a M
virtual memory paging file  It functioned but it crawled  this was the OCT
build

I upgraded the machine to M and the performance is good
At that point I installed the March Build  Consider they
are probably still working on the feature set and havent done a lot of fine
tuning to the code yet

Chicogo is what I want to use  It is like NT a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements 
and does not meet DOD security specs but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS  there are a few otehr differences but those are the 
main ones  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August
        The Chicogo and NT development groups at Microoft are in intense 
competition so it is said  However I think a different relationship will 
arise NT will be the server Netowrk Techonology Chicogo will be the 
client machine  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT think of it that way anyway  
Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS so don't
scorn the concept
        Anyway don't expect it soon  Windows  and DOS  are supposed to be 
released next year read see it in  so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '

I have little info on Chicago so I cant make a comparison  Is it in Beta  Is
there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison

Chicago from what I have read is projected to run in M on  and higher
It is definitely aimed at the desktop 
It  is rumored to offer preemptive multitasking
multithreading but will not offer multiprocessing Is  bit and no reliance
on DOS It is rumored to have an integrated file and program manager 
DOS  is rumored to be similar to Chicago but without the GUI Is also
a step towards CAIRO the next generation OS which is rumored to be 
object oriented
I wonder where Windows  fits here is it a stepping stone to Chicago
Hope this helps

I would like to replace by ATI Graphics Ultra with a truecolour accelerated
card I was about to buy the ATI Ultra Plus EISA but it has had so much
bad press that I am reconsidering

I have the ATI GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO EISA version  I must admit it has 
received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had  Now the 
drivers that are available for the EISA version are the same ones as the ISA 
and Local Bus v Build   Some people complained about problems they 
had with the Build  drivers fortunately I couldn't duplicate them on my 
machine but I did have one problem with Harvard Graphics that nobody else 
seemed to have

 
I would like an accelerated card
             a card that does bit true colour at x at least
             a card that does x at  colours or more
             a card that has fast polygon fills
             a card that has fast bit blits
             a card that has a robust windows driver
             a card that has high speed noninterlaced refresh
 
Any suggestions
 

I wouldn't recommed the ATI for bit colour at x at this resolution 
the display will be interlaced  But at bit it isn't I thought it was my 
monitor but it isn't its the card that is the only time you will get 
interlaced  If I come up with cards more suited for your needs I'll let 
you know

Chicogo is what I want to use  It is like NT a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements 
and does not meet DOD security specs but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS  there are a few otehr differences but those are the 
main ones  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Microoft are in intense 
competition so it is said  However I think a different relationship will 
arise NT will be the server Netowrk Techonology Chicogo will be the 
client machine  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT think of it that way anyway  
Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS so don't
scorn the concept
	Anyway don't expect it soon  Windows  and DOS  are supposed to be 
released next year read see it in  so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '
How does Chicago differ from the sort of announced Windows  My understand
ing at least from the InbfoWorld accound of Windows  is that it's sort
of NT Litea fullfledged operating system but lacking server and security
features that make NT such a bear Is W not true multithreading

Hello
  
  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework  I have
come across a few that look good
Zinc

  Has a platform independent resource strategy  Not too important for me right now


brettharpercimlinccom


Just a thought on resources  It is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources  I have
used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS  I wrote a resource
converter from OS to Motif but it really wasn't too easy especially
the naming scheme In Motif you cannot rename controlswidgets
With windows you can call the OK button IDOK in every instance
this doesn't work for Motif you'd have to call it DialogOK
and Motif expects a text string rather than a number  So 
your constructor should know how to convert a define into the
proper resource identifier
I'd check on how the toolkit expects names and that if it does
use resources that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to  By the way I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel
for anything

dudekacsubuffaloedu The Cybard writes

I just purchased an Infotel DF Internal  Kpbs modem for my
DX  I have a Logitech busmouse on IRQ a SoundBlaster on IRQ
and an IO card with LPT COM COM and a game port  The modem is set
to COM and IRQ  The modem works with the QuickLinkII software that it
came with but I can't get it to work with the Terminal accessory that is
included with Windows   It gives me an error that some other device is
using COM  What is the problem  How do I fix it

The problem was that windows checks all com ports upon startup  Both COM
and COM use IRQ so windows considers this a conflict  QuickLink
somehow is not bothered by this  My solution was to disable COM since I
have no need for it I don't even use COM

I have precisely the same problem with my PC Logic  crap modem
All the DOS packages work fine none of the Windows ones do

OK so how do I dissable COM

Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond xx driver

if anyone else had seen this


As a followup this is a coworker's machine  He has the latest  drivers
It only happens using the xx driver  Sometimes it takes a minute
or so for the cursor to wig out but it eventually does in this mode  I
susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants  I excluded
acff in the EMM line and in systemini  The problem persisted
Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components
It is a mhz DX Eisa bus with an Ultrastore xx controller  Ah well
I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it
before  Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order but I do find folks here
usually are far more in the know

You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than
in DOS  regardless of what communication software you are using

Try the following
    Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to  The
       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine
       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters

    Use a different UART for your serial line  The old UART's  or 
       can only buffer one character internally  The new UART's  can
       buffer  which should be plenty for most situations  You can run
       windowsmsdexe to find out what UART is on the machine

I had enough problems with my ISA bus Ultra Plus that I finally returned it
but many of the people I spoke to through the net were happy with the EISA
version of the Ultra Pro  I kind of suspect the MACH chip was designed
with a bit external bus in mind and the ISA version is kind of a hack but
that's just a guess

As the subjects says Windows  keeps crashing givinh me GPF on me of  
late  It was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every  
day  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie I  
can't reproduce crashes and they are not always GPF's in the same  
application Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  
that caused an error but other times windows acts very strange and I  
need to reboot

Some background  I have a Leading Edge sx with Phoenix BIOS  When I  
first got it it had Mg of memory  It ran windows fine not too many  
GPF's  Then a couple of weekends ago I installed Lotus  for windows  
with ATM a game card and an additional   Mg SIMMS  The Leading edge  
machine is kind of strange in that it has the IDE controler built into  
the motherboard the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  
the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS Apparently I  
was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  
board  The original Mg ns SIMMS where of the  chip variety from  
SAMSUNG and the ones I installed are  chip SIMMS They are recognized  
fine by the BIOS RAM check The game card is a generic  gamecard

The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  
rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctlaltdel still leaves  
the machine kind of flaky but turning it on and off doesn't 

I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card because as I said  
these GPF are not reproducible at will  I have gone through and entire  
day using the computer with no problems and then I might get  or so GPF's  
in the sppace of  minutes

What can I do  This situation is most annoying Are there any good  
diagnostic tools for hardware Do you think that this might be a software  
problem ie EMM etc If it helps i have manage to get GPF's on After  
Dark quicken Paint shop pro A lot of them have been in userexe or  
gdiexe

Any help is truly appreciated

Be that what it may I would really suggest to everyone to take the
opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops  They aren't actually
incredibly indepth but you do get a lot of material about bugs and
optimization straight from those in the know  Besides that they offer
you HUGE discounts on software  If I remember correctly you could pick
up Word  Excel  or whatever their presentation program is for 
That is the full blown version not an upgrade or educational version You
could also pick up Microsoft Office for  or something like that  Myself
I sprang for Word

The value of these workshops aside you ought to be able to buy full copies
of all this software through your campus bookstore or software distributor
at these rates  I'm not aware that the educational version of Word or Excel
is doped down in any way


Well hope that was helpful to someone  And besides that I hope someone
will go to a workshop and save a little money

And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this  I really love your products
I need a job once I graduate also can we work something out

When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about
 megs of swap file space my  meg HD was nearly empty at that time
I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded now my HD is nearly full
and windows just took  megs

One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous
nonfragmented space  I suspect that is more responsible for the
difference than the amount of free disk in your case

I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your
permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size  I have  megs
of RAM and windows took  meg perm swap file  Works very well
In fact with my available HD space about  megs it won't let me make
the swap file any bigger
You should change your virtual mem swap file to  megs I think
that is what you said your RAM was

It depends on what you are running  We had to increase our swap
file I think it is now MB when some applications couldn't
run without everything else closed

gswinzip which I downloaded from Cica  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to
work on it's own but needs some more files that I don't have  I want to run

After setting up Windows for using my Cirrus Logic  VLB GraphicsCard
It moved a normal Window from one place to another 
My Parameters where just the following   DX  VLB 
The Card is equipped with  MB Dram not Vram there are  sockets for Vram 
And the moving of the window just looked like it looked at a friends
DX  DX and an normal ISA ET

What I was wondering why is it not using the BITBLT  Engine which
is suuposed to be on the Chip

How are the experiences here
Have I done something wrong 
I installed the MSWIN  MultiResolution drivers which where supplied 
with the Card 
Would be nice if somebody could tell about his experience with this card
Also if there are newhopefully faster drrivers around I would love to 
how to get hold of them  ftp or whatsoever

   I have normal procomm plus for dos but I've been considering buying
 the windows versionit got really great reviews in computer shopper
 I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here
 using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the
 modemhe has a  modem on a   Mhz machine  I can't
 see it having trouble keeping up  His pcplus for dos works great

re What to do after the high speed modem arrives       Edition  Apr 

This article applies only to Windows  and  and not to NT OS
or DOS apps not running under Windows

One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that
their RSC serial COM performance is seriously deficient  Almost
everyone who purchases a highspeed modem Vbis V PEP or HST
discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept
an incoming FAX at  after upgrading the modem  Overrun and retry
errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or
FAX program  If the transfer completes at all it may take even longer
than with the old bps modem


There are three reasons for the problem

 The Universal Asynchronous ReceiverTransmitters UARTs used in most
   PCs are primitive Ns devices with singlebyte FIFO buffers  If the
   operating systemdriver cannot read and flush each character at high
   interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and
   the previous one is lost  DOS being a fairly singleminded
   environment during datacomm can usually keep up Windows can't

 Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS and
   interrupts often take longer to service  Overruns are much more likely
   than under DOS  As soon as you report to your PCmodem vendor that you
   are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a
    More likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance
   about this issue  you'll get no useful advice at all  Most of the
   storefront and mailorder sources I spoke with in attempting to solve
   my own problem had never heard the term  and many didn't even
   know what a UART was

 Even your PC has NsA UARTs and PS's do or if you can upgrade
   your motherCOM board or add a new COM board you may STILL experience
   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers
   don't take full advantage of the   Windows  is improved in this
   regard over  but I still recommend a driver upgrade  Applications
   like ProCommWin which is what I use cannot get around this problem
   by themselves

If you have a modem CARD you may not have a problem as the modem part of
the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART and avoid
overrunning it however I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers
were that clever and will insist on a  UART if I ever buy a modem
card  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs but if they
are to work with standard Windows drivers they need to simulate one
Use MSDEXE below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be


The Hardware Situation

The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns
or Ns chips or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace
them  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft
diagnostic program WINDOWSMSDEXE  Be sure to run it in DOS before
bringing up Windows   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from
accurately identifying a  if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt

The Ns UART has separate byte transmit and receive FIFOs with
configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to
 bps although with current modem technology there's no point in
pushing your luck by going over  bps The  has shorted access
cycle times than the  or   The  also has DMA capability but
it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this  For more technical info
see National Semiconductor Application Note AN

So what UART component do you have

Try to locate the UART on your mother board multifunction IO card COM
board or ISAMCA modem card  If you can't find a socketed component with
the numbers  or  your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI
and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement  If you can DISABLE
your VLSI COM ports as I chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket
COM board

If you have one or more socketed  or  chips you can buy plugin
NsAFN or PCCCN low power CMOS version ICs from several
suppliers typically for  to  each  The N chip is the normal pin
dualinline package  Other styles are available but avoid any Ns
chips without the A the CC are presumably all OK

Early Ns chips have bugs although National will reportedly exchange those
of their own manufacture for free  Clone chips are available from various
IC makers other than National  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states
support for the following apparently equivalent chips
National Semiconductor A  
ChipsTechnology       C
Texas Instruments      tca
Silicon Systems        M
VLSI                    C
TurboCom warns about the preA Ns and Western Digital C
says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS SX and 
systems IBM reportedly will upgrade them

If you DON'T have socketed  chips you'll need to buy an after
market COM or multifunction board If this is a modem card situation you
may be hosed To add a new COM or multifunction card you'll need to
either disable the COM ports you are replacing or reassign them to
COM although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom

Although cheaper cards are available in the interest of getting the
problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology
MCTAIO card from

JDR Microdevices
 Samaritan Drive
San Jose  CA

The MCTAIO and the  is important sells for   It is an bit

COM        ribbon     COM  IRQ   NsAFN in socket
Parallel   DBF      LPT  IRQ 
Game       ribbon

The kit includes a ribbon cable and DBF connector for the secondary COM
port a ribbon cableconnector for the game port two bulkhead plates for
the ribbonbased connectors and a FtoF adaptor cable  Each port can
be individually disabled and the COM ports have TX RX RTS CTS DTR
DCD and DSR jumpers

JDR also sells a SuperIO mf card that also has IDE

I have heard from several people about less expensive mf IO cards

Their card is  wone   w and they sell AFNs for 

RS DATA SYSTEMS INC

PHONE

I have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR

Meanwhile back at the MCT card from JDR I only needed two serial ports
and am running out of IRQs on my PC so I disabled my builtin VLSIbased
 ports However with the TurboCom driver below I could have set
the internals as COM and  using IRQ sharing


The Software Situation

Simply upgrading to  UARTs will not completely solve common overrun
problems  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the
 The Windows  drivers are even less capable and the Windows 
drivers have the following limitations
  They enable only the receive FIFO and only at rates above  bps
  They never enable the transmit FIFO which  results in an interrupt
   rate of x during uploads
  They set the trigger level at  bytes too high  it's easy for 
   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO
  The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 
   With a Vbis modem  sparse data and text can easily compress 
   or more suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of  bps would
   be effective
  The API won't accept rates above CBR
  The API won't let DOS programs know there is a  there and even
   if it did DOS programs that aren't aware get little benefit
   from a  port with the standard drivers
  They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM
  The BIOS doesn't initialize COM properly in many systems
  Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port
   speed options above  bps

These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS  and may
or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after  but before 
Rumors suggest they may be solved in Windows 

You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying
a copy of TurboCom current version  from

BioEngineering Research
Pacific CommWare Division
 Beacon Hill Lane
Ashland  OR   
  voice
  FAX
  BBS
MCImail    
CompuServe 

Price was around  as I recall  BioEng is not set up to accept credit
cards so I had to send a check  Egghead and Software list TurboCom
but as far as I know they don't stock it  Bio is not a software company
per se  They apparently needed reliable hispeed serial connections for
an inhouse instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a
market for it revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite They
recently upgraded it for Windows   It is runtime licensed

I now have my host DTE connect rate set to  bps most of  my
datacomm apps and I am having ZERO problems with downloads I routinely
see transfer rates that exceed  bps I am also using  bps
when linking an HPLX to my PC with lossless bidirectional IO
Uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts
are still using antique UARTs and drivers

Note that  is still the highest rate that the Windows  Port menu
in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port  TurboCom gets
around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will
set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the
Windows APIs and dialog boxes

I also have CTSRTS hardware flow control enabled and I suggest that you
do the same  Even if you only ever transfer bit ASCII data XonXOff is
not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control  The informal DEC
standard for XonXoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another
 yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving
system or device  The  byte FIFO in the  is clearly not big enough
to let us rely exclusively on XonXoff  A wellrespected datacomm
engineer has informed me that the 's can't really do CTSRTS all
by itself in the DOSWindows environment so using data rates above
 may still be risky

Even with hardware flow control a  with TurboCom can still
experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and
serious swapping in progress If this is your situation you may need to
buy a coprocessed COM board but this will cost you more than a
TurboCom upgrade  A review of two such boards and a review of
TurboCom can be found in the Feb' issue of Windows Sources magazine
I suggest trying a TurboCom upgrade first and experiment with
process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose
thrashing system still runs into comm problems


Closing Soapbox Comments

The state of RSC serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across
the computer industry  Because it is the oldest standard IO interface
the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be
assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer
companies  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years
behind the state of the art In my last job with a major workstation
vendor I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the
initial designs of a new system  That family of machines was
subsequently introduced with  ports  However this is the
exception  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent
IO

You may as well learn what you can about serial IO because this
situation shows no sign of improving soon  When VFAST arrives I expect
cries of outrage from Windows users worldwide whose  PCs sort of
work today with V but will fail miserably with VFAST  Without a
hardwarebuffered UART like the  and without software drivers that
use that UART to best advantage a VFAST modem will be a waste of money

This may be a simple question but

We have a number of PC's which we use to link to a mainframe using 
Novell LAN WorkPlace for DOS via WIndows  
Now to make life easier for us we are thinking of using Windows for
Workgroups to allow file sharing across our PC network 

Now does anyone know if it is possible to use WWG and Lan Workplace
for DOS at the same time 

ie Can I access a file on another PC while being logged on to the
mainframe at the same time simultaneously

Any help well appreciated

 Cwindowssystemvgalogorle  If my memory serves me correctly
 rle is a compressed bmp format  
 
  An is readable by WinGif Paintshop Pro Paint and god knows how

That isn't enough to change your Windows startup logo  vgalogorle is not 
needed after you have installed Windows  It is incorporated as a part of 
wincom
	To make a new wincom you have to concatinate three files together 
using the b option for a binary concatonation  I beleive it is

copy b wincnfvgalogolgovgalogorle mywincom

Make sure you backup your wincom file in anotehr directory before you do this 
 I absentmindedly typed wincom instead of mywincom and had to resinstall 
Windows
	Anyway substitute whatever RLE file you want  The wincnf has the 
info needed to start Windows think of it as a bootstrap and vgalogovga has 
video information  Just make sure that the RLE file doesn't tip the whole 
COM file size over the k limit of a COM file
	So anyway I use mywincom to startup MS Windows  Now instead of that

Hi all

Does anyone know if there is a good sound formats conversion program out

there  Like PaintshopPro for picture formats conversion

Please send me a copy of your reply

thanks a lot

Hi

	THe best sound conversion program I've ever seen is SoundTool which
is shareware from Germany  I found a copy somewhere in wuarchivewustledu
a long time ago but I don't know offhand what directory it was under  It's
GREAT at converting files of all types including Mac NExT Sun and
various PC formats It's also a great player and editor with various
special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame  It requires a
driver for various sound cards The only builtin one is for the pc speaker
and even that sounds pretty good but if you're just using it to convert
things you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound
Recorder

Give it a try

Bret

On a similar note has anyone found out a way to do this with MS FoxPro for
Windows My setupini file was modified on disk  all encrypted Well
of course I forgot about Microsoft's stupid arrangement when I got the 
software and used my name it was paid for by the company I'm doing 
consulting for When my job is done it's their software Any ideas before
I start doing dumb things to a copy of that file

Mattias
ps NO  I don't want to pirate this software I just want to avoid having
to buy a new copy in order to change the registration information and then
having a copy lying around I don't use

maybe I can get a new disk

via SLIP or not into the University's network and thus the Internet at
the very least to exchange email but possibly also to do ftp's etc For
now this would be done via a  bps modem

He would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check
mail but would otherwise connect whenever needed

Chicogo is what I want to use  It is like NT a true OS with thrue

and does not meet DOD security specs but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS  there are a few otehr differences but those are the 
main ones  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Microoft are in intense 
competition so it is said  However I think a different relationship will 
arise NT will be the server Netowrk Techonology Chicogo will be the 
client machine  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT think of it that way anyway  
Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS so don't
scorn the concept
	Anyway don't expect it soon  Windows  and DOS  are supposed to be 
released next year read see it in  so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '
How does Chicago differ from the sort of announced Windows  My understand
ing at least from the InbfoWorld accound of Windows  is that it's sort
of NT Litea fullfledged operating system but lacking server and security
features that make NT such a bear Is W not true multithreading

 
	Can anyone tell me how ChicagoWindows  would differ from

here   I'm simply curious  if there is going to be any feature
advantage in either of these products I do not consider the fact that
it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature

While there are too many PS clones to count some of which are quite poor
trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require
some patience Three questions come to mid real quick for something like
this

Q	Which version of Adobe PS will we clone
	Aside from the level  and level  issues Adobe has in the past released
	new code that incorporates modificationsupgradesfixes just as all other
	software vendors do The level  stuff may seem sound now but I assure
	youchanges will become more frequent as their customer list begins to
	dwindle in the face of competition This allows them to shift people to
	maintenance as well as design efforts for level 

Q	Do we duplicate the bugs or do we make it work correctly
	From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet  there have been bugs If I had
	a number to call at HP or Adobe they'ld have heard from me Deciding
	which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate

Q	Do we follow the Red Book or do we follow someone's implementation
	Without a doubt there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's
	PS With level  many issues have been refined but the Red Book does
	leave big big holes in the implementation specific stuff It would be
	nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two
	different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given
	an identical set of conditions

Q	PSCRIPTDRV
	Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself the unfortunate side of
	testing is the limited number of sources for test files The primary
	source we use is Genoa And having characterizes their  PS ATS files
	 of them over half are taken from PSCRIPTDRV It may not ideal
	but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use I'm sure that Adobe
	uses them too but Adobe's output is by definition correct even if its
	wrong

Yes there are some very poor clones We've seen them here at Rastek a sub
of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript Some are poor for lack
of design some are poor because they followed the Red Book and some are poor
because the vendors don't know what PS is

	ahh yes this is a fun topic  No once the name is incribed on the
disk that is it it is encoded  Not even a HEX editor will find it  You can

But a disk compare utility old versus new will  And Windows  is
also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files
onto your hard disk which greatly speeds things up and makes them
less annoying if you can spare the  or so compressed megs

write over the Licensed to but you can't change the name underneth it  I
think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate and we're not
going to promote that here

No we're not  But we're also not going to promote pandering to
corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience  I don't like
dealing with floppies  Personally I have no use for changing the
registration info but I see it as a valid need and one that ought to
be solved using a quick little utility rather than a halfhour
reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one
way or another

So while I'm not going to put much time into it myself here's the
procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information

  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want
to install it  I've been using cWINSTALL myself

  From there copy that directory to something like cWINORIG

  Install from cwinstall

  comp the two directories to determine changes  
    ie comp  winorig reporttxt

  Look in the report file for the files that change  Assuming
they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks at least one
file should have a difference noted at a particular offset  Locate
said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex
editor and do the same for the modified one

  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes I don't
really do cryptography  It's probably just an xor key or something I
think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing
his copy than with real pirates who will probably just disassemble
the damned thing anyway  This technique should work with just about
any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original
floppies when you install in some extreme cases you may not be able
to back the floppies up to hard disk and will be stuck doing a
compare on floppies Lotus stuff is probably like that

As I noted before if you can afford the space on the hard disk and
don't do much in the way of customization reinstalling from one
directory to another may be less arduous  Doing some of the stuff

Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond xx driver
Sorry don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this

Sporadically yes  It seems to flicker or change shape into snow
briefly  Not enough to impair functionality just call attention to
Diamond's professional sloppiness

I have an IBM and run Windows   A friend installed Norton Desktop For

I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program

I have taken it out of winini but it still pops up running with windows
I did a big search and found reference to it in ndwini systemini and

progrmanini has a group   ndwexe which can't be deleted

Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off

I just installed a new TrueType font under MSWindows 
but though all the applications display the font correctly on the
screen quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly
on a LaserJet   nonPostScript printer

When I use the font in CorelDRAW the document prints correctly so I assume
CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer

But when I use the Windows accessory Write the printer prints square
boxes in place of the characters of the new font Yet Write does
display the font correctly on the screen

I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals but got nowhere
All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print
exactly as you see them on the screenso I assume Windows knows that a font
has to be downloaded automaticallybut how to make it do that

Appreciate any help

     Get the friend to uninstall it

After setting up Windows for using my Cirrus Logic  VLB GraphicsCard

How are the experiences here
Have I done something wrong 

The  has its own set of drivers You may be using the
drivers intended for the  or  by mistake

Be sure you have the  driver version 

I installed the MSWIN  MultiResolution drivers which where supplied 
with the Card 

Don't quote me on this one but I'd steer clear of the
multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution
without exiting Windows  I think it's buggy

Also if there are newhopefully faster drrivers around I would love to 
how to get hold of them  ftp or whatsoever  

Version  drivers are due to be release by Cirrus soon
Unfortunately their not available via FTP you have to dial
up their BBS in the USA  I do this from NZ using a k modem
to cut down on phone bills  It took me around  minutes to 
download the v driver

I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet C from Word
for Windows

History when I had a Deskjet  I had to modify the macro so that
it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that
interferred with printing envelops  That bug is still present however

Now the problem I have is that my DeskJet  print driver came with
the printer I bought in December still wants to print the envelops in
PORTRAIT mode  However the DeskJet  feeds envelops the from the
narrow end ie landscape mode  How do I get the printer to print
the envelops in the correct orientation

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not post this to the net since
    a due to end of the semester cruch I can't keep up on these groups
and b I will summarize the best answers to the net anyhow

This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts  Microsoft
admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver
but I've found it to be pretty generic

You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold
in the TrueType section of WININI  This entry specifies the number of
pelsperem at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts
instead of as bitmap fonts  The default is   I've generally been able
to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold  Depending on your
printer resolution and the point size you are using you may need a
different value

The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above   Presumably that
might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something    I'm not
smiling

 Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter  It looks good on paper and
 Steve Gibson gave it a very good review in Infoworld  I'd love to get a
 realworld impression though  how is the speed  Drivers  Support

ntaibsilverucsindianaedu Iskandar Taib writes
 The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hardcoded
 Winbench text into the driver Clever no In any case the Winbench
 results are pretty much inflated

Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review

  Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed as was clearly shown
    by the Graphite and GXE's cheating  Can't they just admit that
    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for andor cheat on  WinTach
    is much harder to beat

  The big cheat that HerculesIIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and
    PolyLine optimization and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't
    do this  but produced almost identical scores  Yet the only thing
    PC Magazine says is that scores are not legitimate  couldn't they
    at least make some comment about its realworld performance

I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance but rather by Steve
Gibson's results which are more realworld based like using Micrografx
Draw to benchmark  If you believe Gibson that is    He writes

    Despite these documented cheats I have to say that in realworld
     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than
     any other display adapter in the industry     Even though it's
     just a modest ISA bus card it outperformed every local bus adapter I
     have including the Stealth  VLB the Fahrenheit VAVLB the
     ATI VLB Mach and even the Weitek Pbased Diamond Viper VLB

This kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it bogus WinBench
or not  

 When and if you get one send me mail I might buy that ATI GU off
 you 

I already returned the ATI GU  My dealer had sold eight of them and 
seven were returned to him  I'm now temporarily back to running an
original ATI GU until I get my Graphite  And yes the GU is faster in
my  MB system than the GU especially in bitmap handling that's where
you use BitBlits

Hercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers you
can buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for  off list to try it out  At
just  for Graphite or  for the VLB version I decided it was worth
trying I'm supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks  I'll post
my impressions when I get it

Is there anything I have to know to install it or do I eventually have

I just want to see its look and feel before buying it

Any pointer would be greatly appreciated

Hello fellow 'netters

I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I
should purchase the Canon BJ BubbleJet vs the HP DeskJet   I
thought rather than trust the salesperson I would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential  And I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson

Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 
dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs the HewlettPackard DeskJet   dpi
Which is faster  Is there a noticeable print quality difference
particularly in graphics  Which will handle large documents better 
pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here  Which works better under Windows  any driver problems etc
Cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  Basically your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable
both good and bad

Advance kudos and thanks for all your input  Email or news posting is
readily acceptable but email is encouraged limits bandwidth


Sincerely

Robert Kayman		kaymancsstanfordedu  or  cpacsstanfordedu

To all hardware and firmware gurus

My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a 
physically handicapped relative of mine  My goal is for this keyboard
to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system
This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World
at its heart  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the
hardware signaling that the  with  Windows   and DOS  will be 
expecting  My project is independant of Windows my hope is that some of
you fellow Window's usersprogrammers will recognize what I need and be 
willing to point me in the right direction 

I have The Winn L Rosch Hardware Bible nd edition  The HB gives
most if not all of the information I will need concerning scan codes 
and even a wire diagram for the PS style connector I will need but it 
leaves a number of important questions unanswered
  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication  I'm
    guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock  In either
    event how is the data framed
  Is it halfduplex or truly one way  I'm guessing halfduplex
    since the host can turn LEDs on and off
  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the AT
    keyboard standard other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard

If anyone knows of a book or article or any other written source of
information on the above please advise me at gametergsricom
Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the  in
the event of a booboo

Thank you for your time

Hello
  
  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework  I have
come across a few that look good

  Zapp  from Inmark
  Zinc  from Zinc software
  CViews from Liant
  Win from Blaise

Some considerations I'm using

  Being new to Windows programming I'm from the UNIXX world the quality and
intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very 
important  However since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows
programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with
the native one  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the
sake of changing the API are valuable

The Microsoft Founation classes afx that come with CC  and 
Visual C are very good they already have a version for NT
it comes with source code and is very close to the navtive API
It also as some classes to manage data structures

hi
  Have you used Mac system x or x If the answer is positive you would
know if mswindows is a mature OS

  Days ago people doubted that mswindows is not a real OS I can see why
they have such question Mswindows confuses many people Microsoft
simulated Mac but it did a lousy job  For example

 You can not create hierarchy groups There is no way to create a group
    in a group If you know how please tell me
 Too many system parameters to take care of 
 uncomplete documentation It's not easy to find the reason why causes
    an unpredictable error
 Group deletingfile deleting
    After deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files
    But if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full
    of nonsense files
 share problem
    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some
    language wo good editor there will be a sharing problem You just
    can not open or save the program if it is loaded It makes sense to
    prevent from saving but not opening

Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows but they just make 
mswindows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs 
the worst thing is they complicate the environment The orginal purpose
of mswindows should be to simplify the environment and make PC easier 
to use
  
  It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if Microsoft want to
keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more
carefully before products distribute

  No flame please

very user unfriendly This interface makes it user friendly For using this

copy this to your windows directory Copy gui executables and other files to

	Hmmmm why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of
those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win and might even end up as OS Vs Win
Well I dont know if Windows is a mature OS if I have seen one in which
case that has to be XWindows   but dont be so quick to judge 
First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try
to use plain vanilla DOS There are lots of very nice commercial and
shareware packagesutilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself
thought possible  For example Norton Desktop for Windows  a replace
ment for ProgMan will give you groupwithinagroup capability and will
even change group icons it will launch progs by association well FileMan
does that too or by dragging the file in the apps icon now Mac doesnt do
that huh   And the list goes on and on Now Windows is kinda
hard to finetune boost and configure but thats trhe price to pay for not
paying  to get a Mac or an OS capable machine an entirely differet
story  On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons
not correspnding to the files themselves well they are not supposed to 
PM is a Program Launching utility not a file manager Modify your 
settings to have FM as your shell and not PM or get a couple of utilities
from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel' I dont wanna get in the
discussion which is a better system Mac's are good in their own way  they
are different not better or worse than Win PCs actually I am writing
this from a Mac lab as a user assistant  so dont think I am partial to Win 
By all means check out the stuff in cica ftp to ftpcicaindianaedu under
the pubpcwin subdir user anonymous or wait for StarTrek Mac's OS on
a PC   the threads we are gonna have then   
Just trying to avoid another MacWin war

Hi there
I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows   I have a  with
a GVGA video board  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver
with other similarly configured computers

I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen

The problem is that once Windows has been envoked the colors start
changing themselves  At first I thought it was hardware but if you open
a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session you don't have
any problems until you get back to Windows  however when you initially
return to Windows the original colors get refreshed properly

Also it is not a uniform color change  so if you are in solitaire the
design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme but
the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue etc

The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark
purpleish black  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows  the
screen gets refreshed again

If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell
network everything is fine

I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the
other machine I had just finished configuring then from the net to this
machine  When I ran into problems I deleted everything on this machine
and the net and tried bouncing it again  When that didn't work I tried
reloading Windows to no avail

Any thoughts on things to check out  I am totally baffled

Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction

   Somewhere in this thread it has been said that Windows NT tm is a 
   multiuser OS as well as multithreading etc  I certainly haven't
   seen this to be the case  There are seperate accounts for each person
   and even seperate directories if that is desired  I don't see an 
   implentation of simultaneuos use though

		   Scott

It certainly is multiuser What I have seen from the March Beta is
that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multiuser
features I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow
two users share one GUI My interpretation of this was that one user
per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want 

I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third
party Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the
net There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like
csh on Unix for remote logins 

In general I liked NT when I checked it out It slow compared to
Win just like any other real OS The beta version although being
slow botts up much faster than my SUN workstation Windows subsystems
also start up a lot faster than X windows I believe Bill Gates was
right when he stated that NT was not for everybody After playing
around with it for a while I was convinced If I owned a busines using
a business computer from IBM or some other established vendor I
would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much
cheaper solution If you are running SQL servers etc It provides
the robustness such an application requires 

On the other hand if you like your DOS games more or less forget
about NT You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats
the purpose of using NT Most of NT's features are visible in a
networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your
machine at will For personal use I would rather wait for the Win
based Windows release whatever you name it than jump to NT bandwagon
I expect most applications will keep on using Win until Win
becomes widely available

Hi

  I recently bought an Orchid Fahrenheit  It's a real nice card
but I'm having very big problems with it

  The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display
in windows Something like every other line or so
Also when I use a DOS gif viewer namely vpic c in Fahrenheit 
mode vertical lines are swapped It's very strange looking
If it uses VESA standards however it works great only it thinks there's
only K on the card There's MB on there

  I have contacted Orchid support and they tried to be helpful but didn't
have the answer I don't think the card is the problem since it works great
on my friend's computer

  Here is my setup
Fahrenheit  MB bios 
 Optichipset AMI bios  MB ram
Maxtor MB harddrive slave
Maxtor Mb harddrive master
Panasonic c monitor
version  windows drivers
windows 
I tried taking all memory managers etc off and took all other cards
besides disk controller off

  My friend's setup is sx shamrock monitor

If anyone has seen anything like this or can otherwise help I will be very
greatful

As I can recall you can click on the upper left button of dos window then 
choose font to change Also there is a demo window to show you in advance how
the font you choose will affect the size of dos window Make  a try

Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond xx driver
Sorry don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this

As a followup this is a coworker's machine  He has the latest  drivers
It only happens using the xx driver  Sometimes it takes a minute
or so for the cursor to wig out but it eventually does in this mode  I
susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants  I excluded
acff in the EMM line and in systemini  The problem persisted
Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components
It is a mhz DX Eisa bus with an Ultrastore xx controller  Ah well
I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it
before  Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order but I do find folks here
usually are far more in the know

I have had several problems with the card
 Applications crashed when moving the mouse VGA mode Fixed by removing
  the line STACKS from configsys The default value STACKS
  does just fine
 Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse in a
   color graphical mode the hardware cursor modes Fixed by turning
  off the hardware scroll xmode scrolloff before entering the graphics
  mode This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows
  With the hardware scroll enabled applications write garbage outside the
  window
 The screensavers do not remove the cursor in  color modes hardware
  cursor I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem
  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions a remove
  fordraw which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove
  unconditionally Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem
 The VESA driver does not support the xxM TrueColor mode Universal
  VESA drivers do not run at all

In Windows I created a permanent Swapfile of Kb as win
recommended me to do that bit access
If I use EMMEXE after win startup I have K of memory
free if I leave EMMEXE out of my configsys I have K
of memory free and windows recommends me a swap file of K

I use DOS with memmaker have MB of internal Memory and a DX

Does anybody knows why this is happening possibly win needs
some UMB's to manage virtual memory If true which UMB's those
that EMM can find without including suspicious parts

I need an optimized DOSenvironment because i develop applications for
DOS using a windows programming environment

it  WC prompts Loading Wing Commander and then a message about 
Using extended memory etc and then my screen goes black just before
the opening scenethe orchestrawould have appeared

I also have a pool game that does almost the same thing  It opens up and
prompts me for what kind of video driver I have  CGA EGA etc  I
respond EGA and the screen goes black   

On both of these a ctrlaltdel getss me back to Windows

Dear friend
  The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC

hmm not that I am an authority on RISC  but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large
The difference is in addressing modes  RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC

 

            Some people say it's fun but I think it's very serious

Can someone out there tell me how to switch Window's screen resolution
quickly and easily  I know that I can go back into install to do it
but what I'd really like is to have is the ability to just change a
couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
changed  I already have both video drivers that I need on my system
so that isn't a problem

Somewhere in this thread it has been said that Windows NT tm is a 
multiuser OS as well as multithreading etc  I certainly haven't
seen this to be the case  There are seperate accounts for each person
and even seperate directories if that is desired  I don't see an 
implentation of simultaneuos use though

Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a
fair amount I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense
of sharing filesystems Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
one could run characterbased apps but graphicsbased apps will have
to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU This is how

Dear friend
  The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC

hmm not that I am an authority on RISC  but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large
The difference is in addressing modes  RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC


I hope this will clear it up 

Taken from one of my lecture notes

    The alternative approach to CISC
 which has been adopted by many in
 recent years has come to be known as RISC the Reduced
 Instruction Set Computer  This can be characterised simply as
 Simpler is Faster by simplifying the design eg  by reducing
 the variety of instructions  addressing modes the hardware can be
 designed to run faster  Even at the cost of needing more
 instructions the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler
 faster design

 A typical RISC processor will

    o provide a large number of registers eg  

    o perform all data operations on registers

    o provide few addressing modes eg immediate or 'register  offset'

    o only allow load  store operations to access memory

    o only use a few instruction formats

    o only support a few data types eg integer unsigned floating

Hi all

has anybody tried to compile CTRLTEST from the MFCSAMPLES directory
after compiling the MFClibs with BWC 

Seems to me that BWC isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded
functions
For example imagine the following  overloaded functions
void samename  void  
void samename  int 
 
After trying the whole day I think with BWC its impossible to take the
adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined
function pointer 
Am I right  Has anybody else had this problem 

	thanx

but I couldn't figure out what to alter   Can some one help me with this

I am considering buying Borland's Paradox for Windows since I
would like to use a database with Windows I don't haveuse
one yet for both workhome use  I would like to advantage
of Borland's  until April  offer if this package
is everything that Borland claims it to be  So I was
wondering  has anybody used this andor have any opinions

 Tom Belmonte

If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use I strongly 
suggest Approach   It is extremely easy to use make reports etc  I
own both it and Paradox and I almost never use Paradox  If you need to 
build up a complicated application then Paradox is the way to go  I have
heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic
Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff work
home use and you have not used a database before I recommend Approach  I 
have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily
I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must 
be different than what is the logical ordering  To permanently reorder to 
use the old DBASE III command the records requires sorting the records 
appropriately no problem since I almost always use them in this order
exporting the database to another database which can still be an Approach 
database and then copying the exported files back to the original 
filename  This is a small weakness considering the other items I really 
like about Approach  It is also a little slower than Paradox other than 
the loading Paradox takes forever and a minute to load  Paradox also 
takes a lot of memory both hard disk around MB and RAM

I think you may be chasing the wrong problem  I don't think it is the
function overloading at all I do that sort of thing all of the time
in BC without a hitch  The big problems I have encountered in
porting MFC to BC is that fact that MFC depends on a couple of
invalid C assumptions

I have never gotten the entire ctrltest app to run under BC but
the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in
which staticglobal objects are initialized ie some objects are
getting accessed before they are initialized  The problem is in the
ownerdraw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section all
other pieces of ctrltest work fine

Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC

 The CFileOpenFlags enum uses hardcoded numbers for the open mode
  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrlh which differ
  between MSC and BC

 All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C
  assumption that a reference to a base object can used be in place
  of a reference to a derived object true for pointers NOT for
  references

I am sure there are other problems along the same lines but I have
not encountered them yet  I have not seen MFC  yet but I hope
that some of these will be addressed  If they are not all of MS's
hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that

 
      If these were my employer's opinions I wouldn't be posting them

According to the April issue of PC Magazine pg  and I quote

Eventually Windows NT is likely to be ported to every successful RISC
architecture  PowerPC and HP's PARISC are the two most likely candidates
with SPARC somewhat less likely because of Sun's relatively strong UNIX
software base

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC
processors  It is true that there are fewer instructions but what is 
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications
As a compromise many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set and a Complex one

This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors Intel has 
certainly proved that

What I want to know is what does this have to do with this group

Hi

While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows  
this evening I got a program has violated system integrity close all 
applications exit windows and restart your computer error

I started to do this when I immediately got a Serious disk error message
from Windows  hit return to retry  I did that about  times and then
rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow
I am including the chkdsk output below

Questions

  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order
What might be some better approaches

  What might have caused this  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more
vulnerable  I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they
cache data writing

The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to 
fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows
and a few other things

Thanks for your comments and suggestions

temp  fileext

fullpath  fullpathtemp

So it seems to be dropping the first few characters with each

I just got a copy of Tobias' Managing Your Money v  I have Quicken 
and it's wonderful for some things but MYM seems to have some features
that Q doesn't  For example Q doesn't seem to be able to handle
monthly automatic deductions from a checking account you know a
monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from
my checking account  Or is there something that I'm not doing right
and Q can actually do that  Anyway MYM seems to be able to handle
monthly deductions  In fact it can apparently do better than that
That is you can specify monthly bimonthly quarterly even yearly
Anyway is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs
Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions  Maybe
someone who has used both  Or maybe someone who is familiar with
each could give me a capsule review  Anything would be greatly
appreciated  If I keep MYM I have to pay for it and I don't know
whether it's worth doing  If MYM is better than Q of course I
will keep it  But if Q can do everything MYM can do maybe even
better I won't  Thanks all

If you post a reply please also cc me  Thanks

I am a novice at best in working with pc networks and am in the
process of planning a small accounting system for a small business

The particular need in this case is for three machines each in a
different office of the same building each having access to a
Windowsbased accounting system

My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the
machines likely a  and two 's along with the appropriate Ethernet
cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit one
additional user kit will be necessary  It then seems logical to purchase
a simple multiuser accounting system along the lines of DacEasy or
MYOB and fire it all up  The  will more or less act as server with
a reportcheck printer attached to it
Cable runs of  feet will be necessary for this setup

Well this all seems too easy to me  Would any of you network gurus out
there tell me if I am out of my mind here  Any and all suggestions however
trivial will be immensely appreciated  My apologies if this has been
brought up before

Thanks

Hi

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HCEXE or HCEXE file to 
compile and generate HLP files out of RTF files
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or WW

If this is not the solution be more specific about your application

Hi there

Is there any utility available that will make Windows
randomly select one of your windows directory's BMP
files as the wallpaper file

Nate
 nate's sig

There are a couple  I am personally using screenpeace which is a
screen saver which will also select your wallpaper from a specified
directory not necessarily the windows dir  Let me know if you want
info  I've been pretty happy with screenpeace and the latest version
 is not at cica but  oak windowsscrpcorsomething

 Hello all you windows freaks out there
 
 I bought Windows  dutch version some time ago and run it on a
  I recently upgraded my computer to a DX K cache M memory
 M Maxtor HD Works real fine but not with windows
 
 When playing Patience SOL or minesweeper suddenly the system hangs
  I just can't move my mouse anymore
 or
  Screen goes blank nothing further
 or
  Screen goes blank computer seems to reboot but stops before reaching
 the end of the memory test
 
 Once or maybe even twice I got a message about some illegal kernel call
 or something accompanied by a hex adress and a closebutton When pressing
 it the application wouldn't close though
 
 I haven't experienced this problem with other programs than these but that's
 mainly because I haven't really used other programs I suspect them to hang 
 too
 
 Anything known about this problem Or better any patches available
 
 
 Oh forgot to tell if in CMOS RAM I make the computer faster higher
 bus speed less wait states enable both caches etc the crash comes
 faster after  min or so If I deliberately slow the system down
 slow bus speed wait states disable internalexternal cache no
 shadowing the crash comes later but comes
 
 Hope anyone can help

Hi

I got a problem too with a DX VLB  Mb RAM  Mb disk
Sometimes when I switch on the computer it starts Windows  Dutch
Windows switches to x switches back to textmode and exits
to DOS After one or two resets the system works fine

Thanks

Hi

I have a MHz SYS based PC with M RAM and a problem

What is the best way to configure high memory with QEMMMAX 
I have a SPEEDSTAR X video card and use Hyperdisk disk cache
software The problem is running Windows  in Enhanced mode and
having any high memory to load stuff high

Note 
I tried as recommended to exclude the region ACFF but Windows
insists on starting in Standard mode

Any suggestions

Dan

If you need just to change the wallpaper then I've written a short
program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfofunction
The bad news is that you need VBRUNDLL to run it and the DLL is
some kb the program is about kb The order of pictures depends
on the system date and the number of BMPfiles in the directory so
the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times
during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed

If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email
it to you It is unavailable via ftp

 Hi it's an easy question for you Windows gurus  I'd appreciate any help

 We need to write an online help for our application  We don't have
 Windows Software Developer's Toolkit yet   Since we just want to build
 a HLP file around Windows' help engine I hope it won't be that complicated
 Anyway could someone kindly give me some hints of how to build such an
 online help if it does not take  pages to explain Or if it is complicated
 would you help to point out what I would need to do it

 Hi

 If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
 SDK of some sort that contains the HCEXE or HCEXE file to 
 compile and generate HLP files out of RTF files

  No U can download whatzip from ftpcicaindianaedu
              This package from MS is all U need to buid simple HLP
              files from Rich Text Format Files RTF This package
              also contains DOT tamplates for MS WordWin
 
 RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or WW

 If this is not the solution be more specific about your application

Hi
I'm having a problem with TrueType fonts in WIndows  I have installed
the Cyrillic fonts I found on CICA and now a strange thing happens
Sometimes windows uses Cyrillic when its supposed to use Times Roman
Examples The PCTools Backup version  has one line of Cyrillic text
in its opening banner the next to last line Importing a Word for Windows
text written in Times into WP also results in Cyrillic
Does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem
Thanks

 I just got a copy of Tobias' Managing Your Money v  I have Quicken 
 and it's wonderful for some things but MYM seems to have some features
 that Q doesn't  For example Q doesn't seem to be able to handle
 monthly automatic deductions from a checking account you know a
 monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from
 my checking account  Or is there something that I'm not doing right
 and Q can actually do that 


Hi
     I have never used MYM so I can not help you with the comparison of the
two products  I am however  a devoted Quicken user and I can tell you
how to set up the weekly monthly quarterly yearly transactions  First
use the Memorize feature CTRLM to record the recurring transactions 
Next define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions
and specify the frequency that it should be used ie monthly  Quicken
willcan not automatically make the transactions for you but now all you
do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be
entered at once  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder it will
remind you when each transaction group is due  For example you could have
three transaction groups  One for payments at the beginning of the month
middle of the month and one for quarterly payments  I hope this helps

Software that comes together with the VideoBlaster
is designed to work together with the SoundBlaster
from the same manufacturer

Since I do not own a SoundBlaster is there a possibility
to use the PC Speaker driver to play audio files for
the VideoBlaster AVI  audio video interleave files 

I think what I should have is a device driver for
the Media Player that controls the PC Speaker Driver
instead of the SoundBlaster card something like MCISPKRDRV

Has anybody heard of such a driver
Or am I on the wrong track

Any information on this appreciated

Please send email since I don't watch this group regularly

I have a small Windows program which I can not get to work 
The program looks vaguely like this


char f

int WinMain

  lstrcpy LPSTRf Hello
  


long far pascal WndProc

  lstrcpy LPSTRf Hello
  


 
I am using large model under Windows  after linking without
errors the RC program said

Sorting preload segments and resources into fastload section
Copying segment   bytes
RC  fatal error RW Segment  and its
     relocation information is too large for load
     optimization Make the segment LOADONCALL or
     rerun RC using the K switch if the segment must
     be preloaded

Using the K switch seems to interfere with the proper function of
the second lstrcpy call can anybody explain what is going on andor
how to fix it

Unless I am completely misunderstanding you try using either Notepad or
syseditexe found in your system subdirectory to edit you ini files

The syseditexe program is cool because it automatically opens you winini
systemini autoexecbat and configsys files to be edited

I just got off the phone with Mathsoft technical service They
are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with Maple and
Norton Desktop for Windows They have no clue at this time
and are collecting configuration information on the systems
which exhibit the problem Anyone having problems loading the
Maple solver in MathCad  under NDW shoud call technical
support at  They made no schedule promices
but are actively working on the problem

In the meantime the workaround is to provide a configuration
selection in autoexecbat to use PROGMAN yuk pew whenever
you plan to use the Maple solver and NDW otherwise I am using
Norton BE to place a little menu on the screen with a  second
timeout to auto boot NDW

Since swapping out my generic VGA card for a Diamod Speedstar X I have 
noticed two new problems

 if I create a windowed MSDOS session  mode when the text starts 
   to scroll rather than printing characters it starts to print
   horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire 
   display  Ctrlaltdel terminates the dos window and restores the 
   desktop

 after a short time in NCD's PC Xremote for windows all characters  
  displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable I am unable to
  restore without rebooting

These are in both  and  color x drivers large and small fonts
DOS  Win  emm and smartdrv installed

I like the speed of the card and have had no other problems  Any ideas
Thanks

I'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card
and screen would have without flickering I'd only suggest using the color
screen if it does  without flickering If this is not too small for
your tastes at a 
Personally I'd prefer the monoscreen as I always have quite a few windows
open If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the
color 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size If you want to
develop programs you will always have to check the colors I used a
 mono screen worst of both worlds and was surprised how the colors looked
I choose on a color screen

I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card Some have
been positive but most are negative Could people please confirm
these  I am interested in the EISA version in particular

 The card does not work in a system with M RAM

 The card works in a M system with some switches
   set but it is much slower

 The card is interlaced in its bit truecolour modes

 The latest build  drivers still do not work in many
   cases

 This card is the fastest full colour card for the money

 This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread 

Thanks for your feedback I will summarize

I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
questions about Windows for Workgroups

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with
Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 
I am considering moving all our machines to WWG

Q  How much conventional ram does WWG use over and above the
     driver for the network card

Q  If I have a Novell NE card are the LSL and IPX drivers
     still needed

Q  Does WWG do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of WWG Note I do
     not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy
     of WWG for each of our machines it is just that I would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs Returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies

Q  If you buy the upgrade to Windows  for WWG does it replace
     all of Win  as you install it or does it depend on current
     Win  files

Q  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out will I have
     any troubles with the WWG machines

When I started this message I was going to ask only  questions but I got carried
away I'll stop now 

I look forward to your replies

Hi
	We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a
serial printer dmp or Laser I have used Works and Windows Write The
output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output but anything
fancy garbles or just doesn't output The exception is outputting to a
Lserjet  which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data not to
bother about handshaking messages I'm sure I'm not alone in this I've
tried most of the PrintNetwork manager options I can think of Anyone
had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it
Thanks

Anyway is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs
Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions  Maybe

PC Magazine January   had a review of several personal finance
management programe as did PCComputing January   PC World
December  also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money
I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your
library

I've been using Managing Your Money for several years and I have
several friends who use Quicken though I've not used it myself  My
overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager
while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your
finances

Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share

	The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts
	checking savings charge cash or brokerage  You can reconcile
	your account statements with the records the program keeps

	The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that
	budget

	A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill
	paying service to pay your bills via your modem
	
	The ability to print checks on your printer

	The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments

	The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts
	up to date  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically
	via modem  Quicken probably can as well but I'm not sure about it

	The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation
	programs


Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that
Quicken does not

	A tax prediction module  This looks at your accounts and budget to
	predict your tax liability for the coming year  It's usefull to fine
	tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early

	An insurance and vital records module  This is a place to keep
	records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records
	It can also compute your life expectancy

	A financial analysis module  This computes compound interest 
	effects of inflation loan payments term or interest yield to
	maturity for bonds savings account yields days between dates and
	loan amortization schedules  It also has functions to help you 
	decide whether to refinance your mortgage whether you can afford
	a particular home whether a particular rental property is a good
	investment whether you should buy lease or rent and whether
	a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation
	This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping
	your kids with their tuition  

	A net worth module  This is a place to record all your assets
	and liabilities  Your net worth can be computed from this 
	information  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules
	are automatically included here

	A desk module  This includes a small word processor a card file
	you can use to store names addresses phone numbers and other vital
	information about friends and associates a perpetual calander a
	rudimentary calculator a todo list a reminder list an appointment
	list and a place to record your phone calls for those who need to
	track such things  Your appointments reminders and todo list
	can be made to display automatically when you start the program

There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has but I'm almost
sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed  If I'm wrong I'm sure
hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp

One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a 
Windows version  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version
of Managing Your Money for release late this year

I hope this information is of use to you  I've found Managing Your Money to
be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records  On the other hand
I know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken  If Quicken has all
the features you need or want I'd go with it If you find any of the Managing
Your Money features that Quicken doesn't have to be useful I think it's well
worth the price

hi

  Have you used Mac system x or x If the answer is positive you would
know if mswindows is a mature OS

This is silly Is Unix a mature OS Depends on who you ask and how
you define mature System  is if anything less mature than Windows 

  Days ago people doubted that mswindows is not a real OS I can see why
they have such question Mswindows confuses many people Microsoft
simulated Mac but it did a lousy job  For example

 You can not create hierarchy groups There is no way to create a group
    in a group If you know how please tell me

So why do you need something like BeHierarchic to create groups under
the Apple Menu Everyone knows that Apple Menu Items are a ripoff of
the Program Manager If you want a hierarchic program launcher there
are lots available

 uncomplete documentation It's not easy to find the reason why causes
    an unpredictable error

And this is easy on a Mac Give me a break Having spent hours moving
System Extensions around and restarting the Mac to see why a certain
app crashes all the time I find this laughable

 Group deletingfile deleting
    After deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files
    But if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full
    of nonsense files

Oh great Ever hear of aliases Wonder why Apple implemented them

 share problem
    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some
    language wo good editor there will be a sharing problem You just
    can not open or save the program if it is loaded It makes sense to
    prevent from saving but not opening

Eh I don't follow

  It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if Microsoft want to
keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more
carefully before products distribute

Why is it that I find the Mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever I
use it 

  No flame please

Yeah right You post flame bait yet ask for no flames

The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only as far as I know  The VLB
and EISA version should have no problems
 
  The card works in a M system with some switches

Again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than M RAM
EISA and VLB or  M ISA  M should not be a problem for you

Nope  I can use x at hz bit and x at hz bit all
noninterlaced
 
  The latest build  drivers still do not work in many
    cases

They aren't perfect but are much improved  I don't recall the last time which
I had to leave mach  mode ATI GUP mode and switch to  or VGA mode due
to software incompatibility
 
  This card is the fastest full colour card for the money

It's quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate
 
  This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread 

I like it

 At least  megabytes of memory  All memory about K should be configured

 At least  megabytes of virtual memory

Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it    but the
new Mathcad is kinda kooky and thus is not subject to the laws of common

We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been using
WWg for a while now  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail
package so we got the smtp gateway  You also need a tcpip transport
package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they
require to get the smtp gateway to work  You need a dedicated pc
for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another
dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff  We do not have the remote mail
going but you indicate that that is what you want to do  

There is a glitch somewhere in the system though  I don't know if it
is MS mail the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the
mail that is sent  The scenario is this  The outgoing mail goes to a
Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go  If that mail
is routed to the VAX the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail
Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail
on the VAX forwarded to some other location  That is the main gotcha
Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header
then a message saying Boudary error garbage code stuff  If you
can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok  The system people
of course say that the VAX is not the problem the gateway is probably
the problem  If anyone wants to get help it is only  for one
support call until problem is worked out  Phooey to that I say  I
am looking vigorously for a better Idea  

If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew  please
drop me a note  anyone  The next itteration is supposed to have tcpip
built in THEY say  The netxt itteration of wwg

Good Luck

I've been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use
ATManager Lately all the packages I've been buying have all
included ATManager as a bonus
I do some desktop publishing using PageMaker and Coreldraw
Coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over  diff

in WSPDPSFDRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup
I had a ATI Ultra but was getting Genral Protection Fault errors

RISC used to mean Reduced Instruction Set Computer true  They
still use the same acronym but only to be familiar  What RISC really
means is a recentlydesigned CPU  

In general most RISC CPUs are like this

    A large number  or more of generalpurpose registers
    A fixed instruction size usually  bits
    An instruction may make only one memory reference
    Memory references must be aligned
    There are delayed branches branch after the next instruction or
a target prediction bit probably willwon't branch
    Instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction
stream

 The latest driver release is  and can be found at ftpcicaindianaedu
 in the pubpcwin directory structure as prozip  I checked with ATI's
 BBS last nite and there were no releases past 
 
 We have the ATI Local Bus card and I noticed that I get garbage around the
 edges of a window when I move it  Has anybody else noticed this also
I have the local bus card also and don't have any such problems with it
now but this is the second card I've gotten  the first card didn't work
in VGA mode correctly  Maybe they still have some quality control problems
I would suggest checking with ATI I went through the vendor I bought the
card from since the problem showed up immediately  I never was able to
get through to ATI's technical support number  

I sure like the way the card performs though  I have the MB ATI ultra
pro  local bus and it is fast even in xxbpp mode

Does anyone have any insight on what I may have to do in order for the program to

 hmm not that I am an authority on RISC  but I clearly remember
 reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large
 The difference is in addressing modes  RISC instruction sets are not
 as orthogonal is CISC

The original RISCs had small instruction sets and simple ones The
idea was that a every instruction should be completable in a single
clock cycle and b to have no microcode and c extensive pipelines

A few comparisons from Patterson Reduced Instruction set computers
CACM V  

CPU		Year	Instructions	Microcode
				
IBM 				Kb
DEC VAX 				Kb
IBM 					
UCB RISC 				
Stanford MIPS				

While researching for the VLSI VAX DEC discovered that  of the VAX
microcode is there to support  of the instruction set which
accounted for a mere  of all instructions executed The uVAX 
subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software
emulator for these very complex instructions the full VLSI uVAX
included the entire instruction set was  times more copmlex but
only ranm  faster

Subject    Norton Desktop Smartcan vs Norton Util's EP
Lines 

I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows and I also have
Norton Utilities  When I installed NDW it wanted to rem out the line
that installed EP EP ON and the command to invoke the Image utility
It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the
version of Image that came with NDW  This makes sense as presumably the
Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU  It did not however
install smartcan in the autoexec  Now two questions
     Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked
       ie Are the two version of Image compatable
     Will erase protect use the info from smartcan and vice versa
       I use both dos and windows and I want to make sure that when I
       erase files in either environment they are going to be protected

From the experiments I have run The two programs Erase Protect and
smart Erase don't use each others info
I currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec and
I don't see any conflicts

FYI   Norton Desktop for Windows version 
       Norton Util's version 

Thanks for any help

Word c doesn't show the periodcentred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box  They overlap each other and
characters on each side which is useless

I believe the character used by WW is the periodcentred 
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or WW
Altering the paragraph  or cedilla  does alter their font
graphics displayed however

Is the WW character used to indicate spaces the periodcentred
character  Has anyone been able to get this character displayed
from a CorelDraw TTF

Hi

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HCEXE or HCEXE file to 
compile and generate HLP files out of RTF files
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or WW

You do not need the SDK What you need and can get free are

Location ftpcicaindianaedu
index      pubpcwinINDEX

First get pubpcwinuploadswhatzip M This contains the help
compiler among other things It is free from Microsoft

Then get these I think these are free too

dir	pubpcwinprogramr
files  hagzip whagzip wfwhlpzip

These are shareware

dir    pubpcwinutil

  Here is an annoying problem Whenever I save an icon which contains dark
colors like dark red or dark purple these colors are converted to the
bright colors This happens with every icon editor including the image
editor that came with SDK I don't have this problem with BMP files
either only with ICO files or icon libraries The problem is with
the icon colormap field in the icon file header Checking the file
with a binary editor I can see that the masks are OK By editing the
colormap manually copying from another icon that I didn't edit I can
fix the colors Does anybody know what may be causing this problem

 Sorry I didnt tell exactly what I need
 
 I need a utility for automatic updating deleting adding changing of ini files for Windows 
 The program should run from Dos batchfile or the program run a script under Windows
 
 I will use the utility for updating the winini and other files on meny PCs  
 
 Do I find it on any FTP host

Well in the latest Windows magazine there is an advertisement for a program
that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk Uninstaller
but it can be used to update a network but only for deleting not adding
or changing their ini files  Uninstaller by MicroHelp Inc  


I am also looking for an ini updater for my PC network and so far without
any luck  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and it's batch
language to its limitlook into DOS 's I am assumming that DOS 
has the same command maybe even moreor lessimproved REPLACE command
I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
file that is run everytime they invoke Windows  This basically overwrites
their color schemes but does what I need it to do  Not neat but does
the jobI'm looking for a better solution though

Presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file If Windows needs a
swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't exist
Permanent is generally faster though I don't know why Mathcad wouldn't
be happy with either typeVer  is and so should any program conforming
to the Win specification

In a previous article hsanocsulowelledu Hitoshi Sano says

I'm not sure if this is the proper place to post this

The icons on Win Program Manager have all dissapeared and i need to
restore them  The files all seem to be there on the disk and I think there
must be a better way than re installing everything  Thanks for any help


Hmmmmm you know this happened to me also
I am not sure what caused it  I think there might have been
a system error and dumped windows  I came back and all was well
except no groups Program Manager was EMPTY  All the grp files were
in the directory  I had to remake the groups with the new and group
selection  ALL THE ICONS AND FILES INSIDE THE GROUPS WERE STILL THERE
AND WORKING FINE  Just the groups had gone out of program manager

Adobe has been doing this for years

I do some desktop publishing using PageMaker and Coreldraw

There are some fonts that are only available as PS fonts  If you
have a PS font that you want to use use ATM  Otherwise it is
a waste of system resources

Personally I use both

Has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this
card Is only in Windows I have replaced card and am waiting on 
latest drivers Also have experienced General Protection Fault Errors
in WSPDPSFDRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup
I had a ATI Ultra but was getting Genral Protection Fault errors
in an SPSS application These card manufactures must have terrible
quality control to let products on the market with so many bugs
What a hassle Running on Gateway  DX
Thx Dave L

I have used both version  drivers for Win  and the new  drivers
I have had none of these problems  No GPF's at all  I have a feeling that
your problems are not with the card or drivers  The ATI Ultra drivers are
considered some of the most reliable on the market and the SS X ones 
seem quite good as well  Maybe you should check BIOS problems in your
Gateway  I know a few people with Gateway DX's and all of them have
found some problem or other with compatibility  especially with graphics

The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using
abusing applications  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when 
people started complaining  I still only have one small problem with
them and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes
reads to the swap file

the ads for the Diamond Viper Local Bus MB memory  million WinMarks

Also a few other questions  Anyone know of a good cheap  x NI

 Unless I am completely misunderstanding you try using either Notepad or

 You can add sysedit  regedit to a program group they are Windows

 The syseditexe program is cool because it automatically opens you winini
 systemini autoexecbat and configsys files to be edited
 
 Is it possible to get it to load other ini files 
 

No When the program is run it loads  configuration files autoexecbat
configsys winini and systemini There is no Open entry on the File
menu You can only edit these four files If you need to edit some other
program's ini file use Notepad or some other ASCII editor

I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used or if it was
just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out The
reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals
about this program and there is no online help for it just an About entry
under the File menu The program looks like something that was intended for
internal use only It's kind of a shame though It would have made a nice
multifile replacement for Notepad

While I do not speak for Peter Tattam I am fairly sure he is planning a 
Winsock compliant version  While this will definitely not make the initial
public release of WinTrumpet it will follow on shortly thereafter

Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta  It looks like an excellent 
product with several features beyond the DOS version

WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP Novell LWP and there is also a direct to 
packet driver version that some people are using with the dispkt shim

Hi there

We are running a  node Token ring with Windows  and Novell 

Every once in a while we run into The Black Screen of Death a phrase
coined by Robert X Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column  

Basically sometimes when you quit Windows the screen goes black and
you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your
screen  Also sometimes when you exit to DOS the same effect occurs
Cringely hints that Microsoft andor Novell has a patch for Windows'
virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this  Neither company
seems to know what I am talking about when I call them

Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon  

Is there a fix for it

Any response is welcome

to the capacity memoryspeed of it  There is no problem printing from

Reposting and summarizing for your information or additional comment

 THIS IS LONG 

I have MB of memory on my SX  MHz an Intel math coprocessor and
a MB hard drive with MB free no compression  I have been running
Mathcad  under Windows  in enhanced mode with a MB RAM drive
MBMB Smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for
several months

I am interested in the faster Mathcad  but I am concerned about reported
swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increased
speed

TO SX USERS

  Will Mathcad  run without a swap file or insist that I use a swap file

So far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in
unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by Email
appear to be

   by fuessllnlgov David A Fuess 

    According to Mathsoft no Mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as
    not to overburden the physical resources They say this is actually a
    wins feature A figure of MB was indicated to me as a minimum But
    you might try anyway

   by berttylersatalinkcom Bert Tyler 

    I'm not all that certain that Mathcad is the culprit here
   
    I have a DX with MB of main memory less MB for a RAMdisk and
    a bit for a DOS session that is opened as part of the startup process
    which I have been running without any swapfile  When I installed the
    WINs subsystem from the March Beta of the NT SDK the WINs subsystem
    itself demanded the presence of a swapfile  The only WINs program
    I've run to date is the bit version of Freecell that came with that
    subsystem
   
    I gave Windows a small temporary swapfile I'm leery of files that must
    remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems well

   by bcaececmuedu Brian C Anderson 

    What is Win  I upgraded to Mathcad  and it installed a directory for
    Win under windowssystem   During the upgrade it told me that win
    was required

   by casestudenttcumnedu Steven V Case 

   MathCad  makes use of the Wins libraries  You've probably
   heard about Wins it is a bit Windows library that provides
   much of the Windows NT functionality no support for threads and
   multitasking and such but can be run under Windows 

   by rhynetczardozchemappstateedu Thomas C Rhyne 

    I also have  Mb of ram and indeed Mathcad  insisted on a permanent
    swapfile it would not run otherwise

   by bishopbaeyerchemfsuedu Greg Bishop 

     MathCAD absolutely requires MB RAM with MB swap file or MB RAM
    with MB swap file  It will give you a not enough memory error if the
    swap file is less than MB  It is a MAJOR resource hog  If you do not
    load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about MB of RAM
    real or virtual just to load again due to the wins libraries


                                                                              
 So it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on Mathsoft's  
 advertisement for  that you need a swap file possibly as big as MB   
 Looks like I would just need an MB swap file and would need to choose or  
 can I between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file
                                                                              
 Apparently a Win subsystem ships with Mathcad   how much disk space    
 does this require                                                           
                                                                              


I also received these answers

   by mfdjhuxaecnbguedu Dale Hample 

    If you've got  megs of RAM why not configure megs as a ram disk for
    Mathcad  DOS  permits different bootup configurations


                                                                              
 Can Mathcad   Win be configured to use such a RAM drive instead of a   
 swap file  If not I don't see how using DOS  for an alternate bootup    
 would provide Windows with this swap file   Some time back I remember a     
 discussion about the issues of using a RAM drive to support a swap file     
 but I thought this involved slower  MB systems                           
                                                                              
 I have DOS  but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation

    Presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file If Windows needs a
    swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't exist
    Permanent is generally faster though I don't know why Mathcad wouldn't
    be happy with either typeVer  is and so should any program conforming
    to the Win specification


                                                                               
 So far MB has been enough RAM to avoid the overhead of running ANY swap    
 file  I have been running Mathcad  under Windows  without one

	Can anyone tell me how ChicagoWindows  would differ from
OS x  Believe it or not I'm not trying to start a flame war
here   I'm simply curious  if there is going to be any feature
advantage in either of these products I do not consider the fact that
it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature

One difference will probably be the same difference as between OS and
Windows x nowone will likely have a lot of software available for
it and one won't emulation with the inevitable incompatibilities that
crop up in spite of all the contrary claims just doesn't count when you
have to use a certain software package that doesn't quite run properly
under the emulation Developers want to channel their resources toward
a platform that has a large installed base and in a case like that the
platform that is most successfully marketed regardless of its relative
sophistication will win

So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned
on or not Is it worth it to run ATM at all Especially with these
better printer technologies  and TT

There are some fonts that are only available as PS fonts  If you
have a PS font that you want to use use ATM  Otherwise it is
a waste of system resources

Or if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use
Type  fonts From what I've heard pure hearsay the results of outputting
TT fonts as Type  is not as good as using highquality Type  fonts in
the first place

Hi  I am having some interesting problems with my Boca graphics card which 
is based on the Cirrus Logic chipset I am not sure exactly which one  The
problem is as follows

If I use any Windows driver at x except for the Kcolour driver ie
 colour or  colour the image on screen becomes too tall  no amount of
resizing on the monitor will make it fit  And if I use Excel with the K
colour driver it hangs as soon as it loads  Anyone out there used this
cardexperienced anything similar

Please reply by mail and I will post any solutions here

Regards

   Simon

I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently
Usually the line at the bottom of the FileManager the status bar I
guess displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection  If I select a whole bunch of files I will get
an exact byte count

Recently I notice it incorrectly displays this count it's truncating
If I select a file that is say  bytes it correctly displays ' bytes'
If I select select a file that is  bytes it displays ' bytes' 
not  Kbytes just  bytes  If I select  it will report only
 bytes in the selection  If I select over a Meg worth of files say
 it reports  bytes  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying
more than  characters

My system DX M memory Stacker  DOS  Win   I've run
the latest virus scanners scan fprot and they didn't report anything
Could I have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting
of the status bar in the FileManger

While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows  
this evening I got a program has violated system integrity close all 
applications exit windows and restart your computer error

Gawd I love Windows 

  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order
What might be some better approaches

You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them
fresh  Data files should be examined and repaired

  What might have caused this  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more
vulnerable  I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they
cache data writing

You're not stupid  Smartdrive caches things and Windows also runs a
swap file which may contain data also  All of this is pretty risky
stuff in a PC environment

The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to 
fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows
and a few other things

A reasonably accurate prediction


Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files

There are three pieces to a file  The directory entry the FAT chain
and the data area  You can think of these as a sheet of lined
notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of X cards

The directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size
and first cluster number  It also holds some other information that's not
important right now

The File Allocation Table FAT chain graph paper tells where to find
the actual data  Each square of graph paper holds a number  If the
number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available  If it
holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad
unuseable spot on the disk  Any other number tells which cluster
contains the next section of the file

The data area X cards is where the actual information is stored
The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is
doled out in chunks of one cluster each  In your case one cluster
is  bytes  As a cluster is filled another is allocated

To read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the
starting cluster number  Now you read the data from that cluster
Next look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read  This will
tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file
Naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump
around and even go backwards  Continue reading one cluster at a
time as you walk this chain through the FAT until you hit the marker
which says it's the last cluster in the file

CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of
the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into
submission  It doesn't have any intelligence so you have to
doublecheck anything it fixes

Now let's do a bit of a postmortem

CGFXVPICCVPICEXE
CGFXVPICVPICTXT
CGFXVPICVIDEOCFG
CGFXVPICORCPROCFG
CGFXVPICVGACFG
CGAMEGOOSEBIRDX
CWINMISCADVWINADVEXE
   Allocation error size adjusted

All of these files have sizes according to the FAT which don't match
the size reported in their directory entries  CHKDSK F will alter
the directory entries to match the FAT size  In other words   the
directory entry for CVPICEXE may say the file is  bytes long
But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of  clusters attached to it  My numbers
obviously are made up

    lost allocation units found in  chains
     bytes disk space would be freed

Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT but is not attached
to any directory entry  CHKDSK F gives you the option of converting these
lost chains to files  You can then examine the files FILECHK
through FILECHK and rename or discard them  Or if you tell
CHKDSK not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply
be marked available in the FAT


CGFXVPICCVPICEXE
   Is cross linked on allocation unit 



CSPARTPAR
   Is cross linked on allocation unit 

These files are both referencing the same data cluster  Obviously
one of them at least must be wrong  It's interesting to note that
CSPARTPAR is your Windows swap file

To fix this you should copy each crosslinked file to a new name
This will fix the crosslink by giving the files unique data spaces
Now delete the crosslinked files  Examine the copies and try to
assemble them properly  Good luck  Hint  Missing pieces are
likely to be found in those lost chains at the top

   bytes total disk space
    bytes in  hidden files
     bytes in  directories
   bytes in  user files
    bytes available on disk

Your disk is pretty close to full  This may be the actual cause of
the problem perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an
amount which exceeded available disk space

In any case the short summary is that something trashed your FAT
There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage
after something like this but you have to run them before the
problem occurs  Sorry

When I use the font in CorelDRAW the document prints correctly so I assume

display the font correctly on the screen

I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals but got nowhere
All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print

Appreciate any help

	I assume you're using the driver available from cica hpvzip
Bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel Click on the
Options button brings up another screen of choices Change the Graphics
Mode from HPGL to Raster and check the box Print Truetype as graphics
this is only available when you choose Raster Now you should be able to
print all your truetype fonts correctly Good luck

To those interested in the new ATI Ultra Cards

I had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and
had asked confirmation of some opinions

This message is a summary of the responses Thanks to all of you that
replied


  The card does not work in a system with M RAM

a The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only as far as I know  The VLB
   and EISA version should have no problems
 
b I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't
   work in systems with over M Ram  There is supposed to be way
   of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this
   but apparently it doesn't work  I posted some help me messages
   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this
   problem

c FALSE

d The VLB card which I have allows you to set memory aperture over M
   by using their configuration software  No messing with jumpers necessary

   The M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards


  The card works in a M system with some switches
    set but it is much slower

a Again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than M RAM
   EISA and VLB or  M ISA  M should not be a problem for you 
 
b Dunno

c Depends on the bus YES if ISA NO if EISA or Localbus


  The card is interlaced in its bit truecolour modes

a Nope  I can use x at hz bit and x at hz bit all
   noninterlaced

b Yes  According to PC Magazine they've tested a local bus version
   that does x in bit which may or may not be interlaced

c Not for the Pro Sometimes for the Plus

   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors This has nothing to 
   do with  bits  only with screen size Note that for  bit color
   and Windows you MUST have  megs memory size calculations notwithstanding


  The latest build  drivers still do not work in many
    cases

a They aren't perfect but are much improved  I don't recall the last time which
   I had to leave mach  mode ATI GUP mode and switch to  or VGA mode due
   to software incompatibility

b True  Many people recommended going back to Build  or 

c They appear to be excellent but have a few bugs For example certain
   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad  do not print correctly though they
   do display OK on the screen They are about par for fancy cards 
   other accelerated cards also have bugs

d Overall I like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than
   satisfactory  I am running the   Color mode as that is all my
   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow

   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond
   Stealth VRAM but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on
   the old driver


  This card is the fastest full colour card for the money

a It's quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate
 
b Yes  I'll admit it was very very fast in bit mode which is what
   I wanted to use it for  Too bad it crashed in many different ways
   every  minutes or so

c Depends on many many things


  This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread 

a I like it

b Well  PC Magazine seems to think it is

c Yes this appears to be true 

d As to greatest thing since sliced bread I doubt it  Better cards are
   coming out  Who knows maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet
   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer 
   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which Pycon was 
   developing at that time  PC Magazine about two months or so back

   Overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it
 


That is the end of the questions These were the most discussed items in this
group so I thought they needed confirmation For those of you not familiar
with the card I have included a summary here from an ATI ad since I don't have
an Graphics Ultra yet

ATI Graphics Ultra Plus
 Accelerated x at K colours
 True colourM at x
 Multimedia Video Acceleration for Indeo VideoRLE and Video  compressed
  Stretch full motion video windows to full size
 Fast VGA
 Includes  button mouse ISA versions only
 Antialiased fonts ed avail in  colour mode onlyI think
 Realtime pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop
 Around a  length card size
 Priced from  US

ATI Graphics Ultra Pro
 Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus
 Faster performance with VRAMS
 Accelerated x at  colours Hz noninterlaced
 Available in ISA EISA and Microchannel
 Priced from  US

ATI Technologies
 

I hope this summary can be of use to you

Al

PS  I am not associated with ATI Technologies in any way other
      than having used their previous ATI Ultra card for a few
      years which I generally liked

Hi  My last question for the year  I have a mailorder noname notebook
with  meg ram  I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when
running desqview but Win and WW constantly crash on me most
commonly citing a memory parity error  The only thing I can do is TURN
OFF and reboot  My CMOS ticks off  counts all the memory every startup
and there is never a problem with this either

Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware  I remember
having some disk error problems when installing it


Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of
this happening I think win vs win s produce different crashes but both
crash frequently nonetheless

I know this is a pain but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account
doesn't have rn  And I will stop asking questions now  Thank you

What the status of Trumpet for Windows Will it use the Windows sockets

How are you attempting to do that

If you are managing PC's on a Novell network get the network management
tools provided by either Sabre Software or Automated Design Systems 
Among the many features you'll find utilities that can help you to
manage INI files stored on users' workstations or home directories 
This is commercial software and well worth the money  To date I have
not found ANYTHING available via FTP that could compare  Reply to the

Hi
  I am working on gathering data on the way that users use
computers This involves getting subjects to type and use a 
mouse I want to be able to watch what they are doing without 
being in the same room It would be ideal if I could watch
the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge
I believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for
short distances ie m I will need to be approx m away as
the cable travels
  The PC's are connected to a TCPIP network and run Windows 
Is there any software that will allow me to watch what is 
happening on another PC
Thanks
Regards

Trying to pin point a hardware problem with my disk Maxtor
AT  Group files get corrupted on a regular basis
Only happens on this drive D had only one corrupt file
in over a year and it was under the control of winword on C
bit disk access and smartdrive are off  Since installation
of dblspace problem has turned from an annoyance to a reason for
murder

Since the most frequent files corrupted are the grp files
are these the last thing written to when exitting Windows

Also are there any pdshareware utilities available that do
a more thorough job than dos  NDD  etc  DOS  and

In a previous article rudimcskuleuvenacbe Rudi Maelbrancke says

In Windows I created a permanent Swapfile of Kb as win
recommended me to do that bit access
If I use EMMEXE after win startup I have K of memory
free if I leave EMMEXE out of my configsys I have K
of memory free and windows recommends me a swap file of K


I think you need the EMMEXE noems
This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any therefore
this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the
bases covered


I use DOS with memmaker have MB of internal Memory and a DX


I do not use dos so I am not familiar with this

Does anybody knows why this is happening possibly win needs
some UMB's to manage virtual memory If true which UMB's those
that EMM can find without including suspicious parts

I need an optimized DOSenvironment because i develop applications for
DOS using a windows programming environment

I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
questions about Windows for Workgroups

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with
Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 
I am considering moving all our machines to WWG

Q  How much conventional ram does WWG use over and above the
     driver for the network card

about Kbyte without Novell  support

Q  If I have a Novell NE card are the LSL and IPX drivers
     still needed

No

Q  Does WWG do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of WWG Note I do
     not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy
     of WWG for each of our machines it is just that I would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs Returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies

No
Q  If you buy the upgrade to Windows  for WWG does it replace
     all of Win  as you install it or does it depend on current
     Win  files

Nearly all

Q  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out will I have
     any troubles with the WWG machines

We run mixed WNT beta and WWG no problem apart from printer sharing beta problem

When I started this message I was going to ask only  questions but I got carried
away I'll stop now 

We had problems with mouse drivers using WWG where Windows  didn't seems to be 
more critical about it It was actualy a port problem with the network card running on xe we changed it to x now everything is allright I think it has to do with the AMI Bios as well

I look forward to your replies

 make sure your hard drive is defragmented This will speed up more than 
   just windows BTW  Use something like Norton's or PC Tools
 I think that leaving the wall paper out will use less RAM and therefore
   will speed up your machine but I could very will be wrong on this
There's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things
up  good luck

I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently
Usually the line at the bottom of the FileManager the status bar I
guess displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection  If I select a whole bunch of files I will get
an exact byte count

Recently I notice it incorrectly displays this count it's truncating
If I select a file that is say  bytes it correctly displays ' bytes'
If I select select a file that is  bytes it displays ' bytes' 
not  Kbytes just  bytes  If I select  it will report only
 bytes in the selection  If I select over a Meg worth of files say
 it reports  bytes  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying
more than  characters

My system DX M memory Stacker  DOS  Win   I've run
the latest virus scanners scan fprot and they didn't report anything
Could I have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting
of the status bar in the FileManger

It sounds like somethingone may have set the 's separator to  in
Contol Panel under International  This makes  look like 
and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of
the file size  becomes  and again File Manager is
confused by the decimal points where there should be commas chopping
off everything to the right of the first period

I've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because I have the same requirements you doand the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com and com using irq or irq unless you buy special drivers from someone who has themI've talked to Mouse Systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com and com as above  but who claim to be releasing one that will SOON

The other alternative seems to be possible but in one case prohibitively expensive ie  port card for  and in the other the authors of PowerBBS for Windows claim to have a  port serial card with buffered  UARTS and drivers for windows to match ie com irq for 

The second paragraph is hearsay because I haven't checked it out yetbut intend to as soon as I can free up  g

Hope this will save you some steps

I've been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use
ATManager Lately all the packages I've been buying have all
included ATManager as a bonus
I do some desktop publishing using PageMaker and Coreldraw
Coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over  diff
types Add that to the TTfonts that come with win and you have a
decent amount of fonts I print my creations out on an HP
Postcript at  dpi resolution with the Resolution Enhancement 
Technology and   well  I get some darn good copies 
So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned
on or not Is it worth it to run ATM at all Especially with these
better printer technologies  and TT

ATM will do nothing for your TrueType fonts  If your TrueType fonts are
sufficient for your needs don't run ATM  I have a lot of fonts that I can
install either as Type PostScript under ATM or as TrueType  I have
noticed that

    	TrueType font files are at least  larger than their Type
	equivalents  If you are using a disk compressor though be aware
	that TrueType fonts will compress whereas Type fonts will not
	they are encrypted

    	With a  dpi laser printer the artificial bold version of a
	TrueType font is indistingishable from the original forcing me to
	install the actual bold and bolditalic etc variants if I want
	to use them  Type PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually
	distinct bold variant from the base font  I realize that the
	artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior
	to the handgenerated bold TrueType variant but it is sufficient
	for my needs and not having to install bold variants saves me 
	on disk space uncompressed

Greetings
   
I've had a bunch of problems with the x  Opening a DOS window on the
desktop can occasionally result in the windows blowing up into a set of
horizontal lines hashing the entire desktop  Nothing can recover this 
except to completely exit from Windows  The other irritating problem is
that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually
scrolling as if a CR was printed without an LF  This seems ONLY to happen
to communications programs but I can't nail it down any further than that
Note though that the comms programs don't have to be communicating  Even
just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in
these programs causes the problem
   
   Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows WPwin would sometimes
blow up and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of
the problem  I've still seen this but only once or twice with WPwin

Are there any Workspace Managers out there for Windows  
By a Workspace Manager I mean something like the HP APOLLO Workstations
have  multiple workspaces under X  There is a window at the bottom
of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces
It overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one
screen  Instead you can spread them amongst different workspaces
which act like independent screens and you can flick between them

Hey sounds great Does that mean that WWG works with ODI I thought it    
uses NDIS        

WFWG does use NDIS but it cooperates well with the NDIS shim for ODI
I've heard that it is as fast as NDIS direct
                            
                                                
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my    
UMBs so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make WWG work       
along           

The additional TSR load is minimal  I think I eat another  K total
This is worth it to me since it allows me to get to my Windows NT 
box  Novell hasn't released a decent NT Novell client yet so I share
through my WFWG box         
                                               
This solution is very usable

it for some reason


For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows
also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse
both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows  will support it 
both of these are  color drivers if you're lucky the manufacturer of
your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a
mouse

 Hope I am in the right group I'm using BC's ObjectWindows version 
 trying to get some date processed in a window object However when invoking
 the window object the calling program gives up the control to the window
 object and keeps executing the next statement The source code may look
 like the following

class MyWindow  public TWindow

	


void MyCallingProg   Could the calling program be a C function
	
	MyWindow MyWinObj
	MyWinObj  new MyWindow
	GetApplicationMakeWindowMyWinObj
	MyWinObjShowSWSHOWNORMAL

	next statement   I want the program to wait here until MyWinObj is closed
	               so that I can get some data back from MyWinObj 
	               I specified the window style to be WSPOPUPWINDOW didn't
	               help Is there any other way to execute the window object
	               so that the calling program won't give up the control
                    Any help would be appreciated Thanks  jun

 How do I set up Windows so that I can play MIDI files
If you install the Soundblaster windows drivers correctly and have
the latest drivers the media player should be setup to play files
authored to Microsoft's Multimedia midi authoring standard General
Midi see the section in the back of the Voyetra manual in the
Soundblaster midi upgrade kit
You'll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different
mappings so don't expect them to always sound correct without using
some kind of midi file editor such as Voyetra's Sequencer Plus

You can attempt to use the midimapper to remap the patches for
soundblaster but since you cannot modify the sbfmdrv you are allways
stuck with the instruments that come with this driver  Unless you can
find an editor for making modifications to the instrument settings in
sbfmdrv  I would suggest you locate the early version of
soundblaster drivers that were mapped to mt voices and the later
drivers that are mapped to the general midi voices

  You can try defraging your disk more often It definitely will
 help speed things up A  megs smartdrv is also a good idea with
 the amount of memory you have and use fastdisk bit access if
 you not already Hope that help

Hello fellow 'netters

I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I
should purchase the Canon BJ BubbleJet vs the HP DeskJet   I
thought rather than trust the salesperson I would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential  And I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson

Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 
dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs the HewlettPackard DeskJet   dpi
Which is faster  Is there a noticeable print quality difference
particularly in graphics  Which will handle large documents better 
pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here  Which works better under Windows  any driver problems etc
Cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  Basically your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable
both good and bad

Advance kudos and thanks for all your input  Email or news posting is
readily acceptable but email is encouraged limits bandwidth


Sincerely

Robert Kayman		kaymancsstanfordedu  or  cpacsstanfordedu

In theory theory and practice are the same  In practice they are not
You mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision
 revised


Sorry for the followup but I couldn'y get email through on your addresses
I too am trying to decide between these two printers and I would like to
hear what users of these printers have to say about the questions above

Thank you

I edited a few newsgroup from that line don't like to crosspost THAT
much  I can't compare the two but I recently got an HP DeskJet 

I'm very pleased with the output remember that I'm used to imagens
laser and postscript printers at school  looks very good  You have
to be careful to let it dry before touching it as it will smudge

The deskjet is SLOW  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares

The interface between Win and the printer is just dandy I've not
had any problems with it

Hope that helps some

I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate
environments under Windows for each of them  Is there some way of setting
things up separate desktopsdirectories for each of them  Ideally
I'd like totally separate virtual machines  I'd be willing to settle for
less and may end up having batch files that copy ini files around
depending on who wants to use the machine

You could use DOS  to do this partly  You can set up different configsys
and autoexecbat commands for each user and they just have to select their
menu option on bootup  Then you can have the autoexecbat copy the winini
and systemini files and change directories for them  When they exit windows
it can copy back generic ini files if you want

This is the only way I can think of  There may be some programs somewhere
that allow you to do this better though using DOS  allows each person to
have a custom configsys and autoexecbat

   So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned
   on or not Is it worth it to run ATM at all Especially with these
   better printer technologies  and TT
   
   There are some fonts that are only available as PS fonts  If you
   have a PS font that you want to use use ATM  Otherwise it is
   a waste of system resources
   

   Or if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use
   Type  fonts From what I've heard pure hearsay the results of outputting
   TT fonts as Type  is not as good as using highquality Type  fonts in
   the first place

Unless you print' to file with the correct resolution set for the
final output device image setter  A problem with TT fonts in Windows
is that they do get converted to T format OK and the hinting is even used
while this is done but the resulting T fonts are NOT hinted  The result
is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the
printer driver when the PS file is generated but they will not look
good when printed at a different resolution  

So when you print to an attached PS printer with the PS driver set up for
this printer results may be quite good  But if you take a PS file made for
that printer and run it on a device of different resolution such as an
image setter then the results may not be so good

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftpcicaindianaedu
 file is drzip They're very recent I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS  last night If you are unable to get them there 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well  
I have a local bus based card VL Bitblaster from Micron but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards or at least includes drivers for them

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the  version 
improving my graphic winmarks v by about  million  to  
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so

From Steve Gibson's columnist for Info World graphic card comparisons 
also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadvzip I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison

							Wintach
             		Winbn	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system
 VLB
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  			 			 

my system 
sx VLB
VL Bitblaster		  		 	 			 


Its no Viper but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review

Micron system owner's I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC VL local bus disk controller My system came with a Maxtor  
drive  MB and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about  Kbs 
I am now at  Kbs Is this about as good as it gets I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls at 
least that was what the program said

The deskjet is SLOW  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares

The interface between Win and the printer is just dandy I've not
had any problems with it

I just bought a BJ printer a couple of days ago  I compared it to the 
sample print of an HP DeskJet  and knew that the HP wasn't for me  The 
BJ is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  I can compare it 
with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical 
depending on the kind of paper  I don't have problems with the ink not 
being dry it seems to dry VERY fast  Probably within a second  Since 
Canon is giving a  rebate until the end of May it is really a good buy

I quit windows normally to run a special DOS app got done with it
and tried to start windows  Ok got the title screen Windows
background DOS with an error about loading PROGMANEXE  Hum yep
PROGMANEXE is still there  Must be bad ok pull off PROGMANEXE
from a backup tape start windows get the windows title screen
windows background DOS with the same error  HUM  Fire up the
good ol' Norton Disk Doctor test  lost clusters  Ok fix them
and look through them doesn't look important  Remove the Windows
directory and reinstall from disks  Fire up windows title screen
background Program Manager Success  

I have a  Amy with  meg of RAM  meg HD SVGA running under
DOS  no special memory managers or stuff just the basic Windows 
A  meg permanent swap file using bit Access  I mainly use Windows
to run more that one DOS app at a time  ie downloading with Qmodem
with a DOS window open and possibly POV running in the background  

I've noticed that since I started using Windows a few months ago lost
clusters have gotten more and more common  Although I don't like
having data just disappear it really haven't been a problem except
for today  Has anyone else had any problems with lost clusters while
running windows  And what could I do to fix the problem I'd sleep
better knowing Amy wasn't loosing her marbles

I am using DOS Quick C  in a DOS window under Windows  and the other
day while I was running the compiler I got a general protection fault
immediately followed by a serious disk error  When I rebooted I found
that about  files had gotten crosslinked which is a pretty serious
corruption of the hard drive file system

I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside
its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrvexe disk cache and
that is what caused the disk problem

I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty wellcontained 
by Windows  If that is true then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing 
to do with it  Has anybody else had this type of problem

I only recently upgraded from Quick C  to

BTW how would you rate the new Borland Turbo C Visual Edition for
Windows anyone

Time for a new discussion maybe  I asked in these groups some time ago
what about the TCVE and got no answers so I decided to try My brother
who lives in the US bought and sent it to me and I'm still trying to get
used to it

Before I put my goodbad points list consider I am a Turbo PascalDOS
programmer and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C just
some exercises from university I used to make some programs in
Microsoft C version   because we used some thirdparty libraries
that required that 
 I like Borland It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft
  specially the debugger I tried to learn Codeview sometimes but never
  felt confortable with it
 TC VE seems very nice to create simple apps like the examples on the
  ObjectWindows book So far no problems Lets see next week or so when I
  will try something more complex
 It works nice even in my weak machine Mhz  Mb Ram 

But

 The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version 
  from the Workshop itself Some of the windows that appear on the manual
  have more itens than in the manual
 I think I will run into trouble since I got this TCVE from my brother
  as a present I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because  I 
  suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese  and  I believe it
  will be far more expensive here So he bought it as a present and sent to
  me I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland but
  who knows

So I'd like to ask some questions for you all

 I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group Is
  there anybody from Borland  Is there any email address that we can 
  contact the technical support  Not for stupid questions but to ask
  for example why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself 
 Is there anybody else using it around here 
 Will the book of Petzold be useful for me  I intend to use RW and ProtoGen
  to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself 

Answers to my email or composmswindowsprogrammertools please

Thanks in advance

Salutations
	I don't usually subscribe to these newsgroups so I would really
appreciate it if someone could possibly email me the answer to my problem
I have been using Windows  since buying it last winter but I have just
now come across an annoying bug I now have about  different groups in
program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that
makes a new group it promptly disappears after I turn of windows
This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v They both created
their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them they were
gone I had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a
previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as I turn
off windows

 Very simple  You have to have the MOUSECOM or MOUSESYS loaded in DOS
 before you run Windows  Note that you don't need to have these files loaded
 to use the mouse in Windows


 and you need a video driver which is completely Windows  compatible and
your mouse driver has to be completely compatible as well  Not quite so simple
I never could get my logitech mouse to work  in a DOS window with my
old Paradise card  now I have a Diamond SSX and the  mouse drivers and
everything works perfectly

Subject Workspace Managers for Win   a small review
Date  Apr   GMT

MessageID romjjqjwerpleapanaorgau
NNTPPostingHost zikzakapanaorgau

Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for
Windows   I found  shareware Workspace Managers from Australia's
MSWINDOWS archive monuccmonasheduau which mirrors some
sites in the US  The three I found were

 WORKSPACES  wspacezip
                                This was the smallest and simplest
   of the workspace managers that I found  It is very easy to use
   It displays a small window containing  buttons plus an extra
   button for configuration purposes  One annoying feature was the
   title window that is first presented when it is run  you must press
   a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away  Also it would
   have been nice if there was an ALWAYS ON TOP setting for the little
   window containing the workspace buttons  Maybe some userspecified
   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be
   a nice feature  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace
   manager makes it an attractive package

 WORKSHIFT  wrksftzip
                               While this workspace manager offered a
   few features that WORKSPACES  lacked it was quite time consuming
   to set things up  With WORKSPACES  all but the first workspace
   is initially empty  With WORKSHIFT  you need to take snapshots
   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like  ie what 
   applications they contain  Also the main window is quite large
   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace
   With WORKSPACES  there was no facility for viewing what was in
   a workspace without switching to it  WORKSHIFT  provides this
   viewing functionality which is quite useful

 BIGDESK  and BACKMENU backdeskzip
                            This is an interesting package which contains
   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager  Other goodies
   include Backmenu which provides a popup root menu when you
   press a certain mouse button  just like in XWindows  The menu
   is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus
   which is provides quite handy access to applications  You could
   say it is a menubased alternative to the program manager  Also
   bundled in backdeskzip is a program called WRUN which allows
   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS
   instead of using the File Manager to run applications  
   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK   BIGDESK works quite
   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it
   doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces
   In fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount
   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to
   focus in on  This means you can have windows overlapping between different
   viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which
   each workspace was isolated from the other one  The BIGDESK control window
   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop  Basically
   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area
   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blowup
   of a particular section

Try each of them out for yourself  I was impressed with all of them
so find out which one suits your needs the best

Dear friend
  The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC

hmm not that I am an authority on RISC  but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large
The difference is in addressing modes  RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC

 

Theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer  That's why everyone
is arguing about RISC vs CISC  Personally I think CISC will win out
Just take a look at the Pentium  Not that I like Intel architectures either
but that's another story

bye


Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc  or that it will outsell
them all  If the first you have to remember that intel CISC like the
pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also Riscs
cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not
even on the same order  but I remember reading about  years maybe 
about a T from hypercube that did a  mips was superscallar AND
reordered its instruction itself so

NOTE The followups are set to compososmisc  DMQS files describe
monitors and valid modes to be used by the XGA under both Windows and
OS

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED  IBM has nothing to do with these files or
this post  It's personal this time and every time I post  see the
signature

Due to demand and requests here are some additional DMQS files I've
collected for the XGA  These files function with the latest revision
of the drivers for the XGA  Not all these files will work under Windows
with the drivers available to the general public at this time  All files
will function under the most recent OS  beta and those I've tried have
worked under OS SP  Not all files have been fully tested

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED  They represent a personal collection not
anything resembling an officially supported set

As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts
 Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec  Doing so can
   stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in
   shorter life how short depends on how much out of spec boom 
 Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of
   spec for your monitor resulting in damage to your monitor
 You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability
   to use the mode you select  Using these files represents hacking
   in a very true sense so practice safe computing and don't play
   around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable
   about what you're doing
 If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings use the DMQS files
   you have or wait until IBM releases official tested DMQS files
   Although you should be aware of warning  even with the IBM files

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED  By using them you may invalidate your
warrenty  Not all have been fully tested  I don't have that many
monitors

Installation unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable usually
cxgadmqs  Then use the methods described in your XGA installation
diskette to change your adapter or settings

Packing these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility  
You will need PKZip x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities

Submitting  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS
files for your favorite monitors  I'm always interested in collecting more

I am looking for a Windows Utility that would give me a listing of files
in a directory but also display a description of the file  This utility
would allow me to enter and edit file descriptions of hopefully any 
length maybe a small window with a scroll bar  I would then be able
to browse my directories and be able to see what is in a file without
having to open or execute it  Any such beast out there  If not anyone
want to write one

	Just got a ssX based on its good ratings but am a little
underimpressed  First is it's performance in  mill supposed
to be comparable to a Trident  or other unaccelerated VGA  I 
came up with only OK performance on WinSpeed  In  it was between
good and great  Second does anyone know where to get that JPG viewer
for the SSX  I saw it on cica or something  Does it work better

Thanks for any help

The deskjet is SLOW  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares

The interface between Win and the printer is just dandy I've not
had any problems with it

I just bought a BJ printer a couple of days ago  I compared it to the
sample print of an HP DeskJet  and knew that the HP wasn't for me  The
BJ is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  I can compare it
with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical 
depending on the kind of paper  I don't have problems with the ink not
being dry it seems to dry VERY fast  Probably within a second  Since
Canon is giving a  rebate until the end of May it is really a good buy

How much is the BJ going for  I got mine for  which was in the
end the deciding factor for me

A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation Once
the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC

Unfortunately there is still a ghost of SPSS left when I run
something like Write and go to embed an object then SPSS Chart
appears on the list of objects I'm offered I looked around all
the obvious INI files without success The next thing I tried
was looking for the string SPSS Chart in every file in the 
Windows directory It turned up in a file called REQDAT or
REGDAT Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel
inclined to edit it

I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers

 Somewhere in this thread it has been said that Windows NT tm is a

 and even seperate directories if that is desired  I don't see an 
 implentation of simultaneuos use though
 
 Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a
 fair amount I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense
 of sharing filesystems Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
 one could run characterbased apps but graphicsbased apps will have
 to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU This is how
 things are shaping up everywhere clientserver architectures are
 taking over from the old cputerminal setups 
 
 Note that the NeXT does this you can always telnet into a NeXT and
 run characterbased apps but you can't run the GUI Yeah I know
 about XWindows just haven't been too impressed by it

I read this in an electronic magazine about NT

And for all the hoopla about NT one would

only one user at a time It can support multiple clients but
only one actual user

I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom  was using  
I think but switched to  to see if it was any better  Vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  I can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about  inch  This is crazy  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be  just venting steam

  I had the same problem  At first I thought it was the video driver and 
  made sure I had the most current drivers because the problem was most
  evident at SVGA resolution modes  It didn't help and after a bit of
  experimentation determined that the problem existed in standard VGA
  resolution mode It was just much less noticeable
  
  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in  It
  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications  On the 
  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse I borrowed
  a new mouse a MS bus model and tried it  That solved the problem
  So if your mouse is old you may want to try replacing it for a newer
  one

 How are you attempting to do that

 Are you using the DISPKT program This provides a packet driver on

I tried to do so but people told me that even if I used DISPKT the packets

FollowupTo composmswindowsmisc

I have a BAT file that I run under a Windows Icon  I have set up a PIF
file to run the BAT file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen
The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable

My problem is that on some of our machines running MSDOS  and Windows
 in enhanced mode the SET command in the BAT file fails with the
OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error  I have raised the amount of environment
space to  bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIGSYS so I know that
I am nowhere near to running out 

From the Windows Resource Toolkit for WinWorkgroups add an entry to
your systemini file under the NonWindowsApp section

    CommandEnvSizeNNNN

This sets the COMMANDCOM env size where NNNN must either be  or
between  and   A value of  disables the setting  If this
value is too small or too big it is rounded up to  or down to 
If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment
this setting is disabled as if it were   If you specify the
environment size in a PIF file for COMMANDCOM the PIF setting
overrides this setting  The default is  with MSDOS versions earlier
than   Otherwise the default value is the e option in the
SHELL command in CONFIGSYS  To set this value you must edit your
SYSTEMINI and reboot


I have used this entry as well as relied on the default e from
the CONFIGSYS shell line and both give larger environments  If
you don't use one of these then the environment passed by windows
to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment
variables present when windows was started  No matter how big
the DOS env was when windows starts it truncates all unused space
except for a few bytes  This should allow your batch file to run
but your mileage may vary

Help I'm bored with the current Windows backgrounds we have here and am 
looking for some nifty pictures to use instead  I've seen from previous posts
that many sites exist that store pictures  available through anonymous ftp
Except that I can't ftp to remote sites from my machine what I CAN do is use
'ftpmail'  mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files 
andor data back
Does anyone know of sites with Windows compatible pictures that can be 
accessed in such a way 
If you do would you please post them

Dear friend
  The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC

hmm not that I am an authority on RISC  but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large
The difference is in addressing modes  RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC

 

Theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer  That's why everyone
is arguing about RISC vs CISC  Personally I think CISC will win out
Just take a look at the Pentium  Not that I like Intel architectures either
but that's another story

bye


Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc  or that it will outsell
them all  If the first you have to remember that intel CISC like the
pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also Riscs
cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not
even on the same order  but I remember reading about  years maybe 
about a T from hypercube that did a  mips was superscallar AND
reordered its instruction itself so

I'm not  sure but I think the T was a MHz transputer  so ya tie
a gazillion of them together to get mips  The newest is the T
which kicks anyone's butt  haven't seen them used much though

Anyway to respond I think the Pentium CISC is better than the more advanced
RISC eg like the alpha etc  the MHz Pentium has approximately the
same performance as the superduper MHz Alpha  here performance is the
weird Specint that everyone refers to  this is what I heard  the
Alpha still kicks in the P's butt in fp  again this is what I heard
and in the computing world if you sell lots of chips like intel and
make it faster like intel you are the winner like intel even though
you have a sucky architecture from over  years ago like intel 

If you can make a CISC chip superscalar superduperpipelined superfast
with the ideas behind the RISC ideology you got a CISC chip  And then
I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC

If the latest technology is a generation behind then it sucks relatively
speaking

Now I may sound like I like intel but I'll have to say that the P is some
real kick butt pile of Si and SiO

But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the K line or I'm gonna
start crying

Hello fellow 'netters

I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I
should purchase the Canon BJ BubbleJet vs the HP DeskJet   I
thought rather than trust the salesperson I would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential  And I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson

Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 
dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs the HewlettPackard DeskJet   dpi
Which is faster  Is there a noticeable print quality difference
particularly in graphics  Which will handle large documents better 
pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here  Which works better under Windows  any driver problems etc
Cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  Basically your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable
both good and bad

Advance kudos and thanks for all your input  Email or news posting is
readily acceptable but email is encouraged limits bandwidth


Sincerely

Robert Kayman       kaymancsstanfordedu  or  cpacsstanfordedu

In theory theory and practice are the same  In practice they are not
You mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision
 revised


All right  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy I'll give 
your question a shot 

The key issue that I bought my BJ on was ink drying speed  You really 
have to try awful hard to get the BJ ink to smear  The HP DeskJets need 
 seconds to completely dry  In both cases however do not get your 
pages wet  Unlike laser printers the material on your pages is INK not 
toner  But that should go without saying

My PC has very little memory only Meg RAM so the BJ takes a little 
while to print  but every application I use takes a while to run  Once 
the computer is solely printing it purs like a kitten and puts pages out 
every  seconds depending on how detailed your graphics are  

The BJ can do Windows soft fonts  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can or 
HP wouldn't sell many

Size is another factor  The BJ is much smaller but the HP is built 
like a tank  I bet the BJ would get damaged first

Finally the print quality  I LOVE the BJ's resolution  It looks like 
a good laser quality print  The HP's I've usedthey look like ink  Not 
as impressive  

So I chose the Canon  Any other opinions

The driver I am currently using is version  and doesn't support more 
than  colors in x mode even you have MB memory 

The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable They are still using bps 
modem It will take you hours to download the drivers it hurts when you
are calling long distance Is there any ftp site that has a collection
of video drivers for windows

BTW anyone using this card and how do you like it so far

I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from

I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed 
When I try to run the drum program it reports that a MIDI device is not
installed however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it
is installed  

Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program
will work with my setup  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a

I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
questions about Windows for Workgroups

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with
Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 
I am considering moving all our machines to WWG

Q  How much conventional ram does WWG use over and above the
     driver for the network card

	I have just checked it and you have three files that are loaded
	PROTMAN    Bytes
	DRIVER	  Bytes
	WORKGRP	  Bytes

Q  If I have a Novell NE card are the LSL and IPX drivers
     still needed

	No WWG uses it's own drivers

Q  Does WWG do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of WWG Note I do
     not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy
     of WWG for each of our machines it is just that I would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs Returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies

	Not that I know of I bought two copies had some problems with one
	installed both from the same copie no problems Do worry I just had
	a really old BIOS and that's the only problem I got

Q  If you buy the upgrade to Windows  for WWG does it replace
     all of Win  as you install it or does it depend on current
     Win  files
	It will replace all older files I think and prompt you for the
	others

Q  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out will I have
     any troubles with the WWG machines

	This I do not know

When I started this message I was going to ask only  questions but I got carried
away I'll stop now 

I look forward to your replies

Whenever I start File Manager the status bar is not displayed
even though it is selected in the options menu If I deselect it
then select it again the bar appears Anyone have any ideas why
this is happening

No not really It may be that your winfileini has gotten corrupted for
some unknown reason Have you tried recreating it by either
exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar
is visible
or
double clicking on the Control menuthe one with minimize and maximize
in in when everything looks proper

If you have and it still doesn't work you may want to delete your
winfileini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally
recreate the file from scratch

Good luck

our token ring results in invalid class error 

While I do not speak for Peter Tattam I am fairly sure he is planning a 
Winsock compliant version  While this will definitely not make the initial
public release of WinTrumpet it will follow on shortly thereafter

Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta  It looks like an excellent 
product with several features beyond the DOS version

WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP Novell LWP and there is also a direct to

I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers
 I think you can do this with REGEDIT which can make changes
to the OLE registration database  From Program Manager or 
File Manager choose RUN and type REGEDIT  You do have it
its included with Windows but not well documented

Hello WinNetters

I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of 
MS Access and Borland ParadoxWin  However are there any users out there 
with experience with the database package called Approach  It has gotten
a number of very good reviews from the various mags and it seems like it
would require less hardware overhead than Paradox  I have ruled out Access
because some aspects of it are extremely nonintuitive eg requiring a
field to always have a value  I like what I've seen of Paradox but it
seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have  MHz
 MB ram

So please provide me with your thoughts are Approach good and bad  Thanks

In a previous article jpaparelcsulowelledu Joseph Paparella says

I've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because I have the same requirements you doand the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com and com using irq or irq unless you buy special drivers from someone who has themI've talked to Mouse Systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com and com as above  but who claim to be releasing one that will SOON

The other alternative seems to be possible but in one case prohibitively expensive ie  port card for  and in the other the authors of PowerBBS for Windows claim to have a  port serial card with buffered  UARTS and drivers for windows to match ie com irq for 

The second paragraph is hearsay because I haven't checked it out yetbut intend to as soon as I can free up  g

Hope this will save you some steps



I had this problem when I first loaded windows  My IO card is for  HD's
 FD's  Parrelel  serial  for mouse and  for my external modem and
a game port  PROBLEM enters  The DARN serial ports have no selection for 
COM settings they are stuck on  and   
Good card for HD's and FD's but lousy for serial 

I called Microsoft and other places  The long and short of it is
WINDOWS wants com and  ONLY for mouse selection
I went out and bought a small IO card just for parrelel and serial
Now I have ALL  active COM ports and LPT and LPT
This Half card was less than 

Mouse on COM   external modem on COM   I disabled the LPT so I could use
the interupt for my scanner card IRQ

    I just moved from Borland C  to Visual C today When I tried
to compile my C program it complained a function prototype problem
It turned out that the typedef WORD in MS C is a BYTE not unsigned int

    Could anyone shine some light on this subject  Why a WORD is a BYTE

Hey now  First of all sorry to post this DOS question in a WINDOWS
group but I'm in kinda a hurry so I can't scramble to find the dos
groups' names  

Anyway anyone know where I ccan find the exit codes to DOS commands

There are  alternatives
 You can try to write a small C program something like

   int myintvar
   myintvar  systemcommand

   and display myintvar value which is the exit code of the command

 Or use doscom instead of commandcom it has built in move command
   you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function
   of dos

   cecho execcommand

   will display the exit code of the command

 Get DOS  not worth buying if you already have QEMMPCToolsNorton
   and you only need the move utility

the manual doesn't seem to have all of them  I'm particularly looking
for COPY in order to make a move batch file such that if the file
wasn't coppied properly it won't be deleted


please e'mail lourayseasgwuedu

 The window shows up with all it's children fine Now I create another 
 childt with a WSTHICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of
 it's siblings Style WSTHICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it How do
 I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings
 I used SetWindowPos and BringWindowToTop without success What's happening
 is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go it goes
 behild it's siblings

The window is probobly on top but the lower windows are drawing over it
Try using WSCLIPSIBLING to keep the lower siblings from drawing on the
top sibling's space

This isn't entirely true It is true that TrueType fonts are

	 File Type      Compression Ratio
	    
	 TTF TrueType     
	 PFB ATM          
	 PFM ATM Metric  

Although the metric files are small they compress quite largely
And as you can see even the regular PFB files have some compression

So doing the math on one such comparitive font file

TTF Times   bytes   bytes compressed
PFB Times   bytes   bytes Compressed

You still win out even if the ATM Times font isn't compressed

Your mileage may vary depending on compression program

ok i have a dxISA w Diamond Stealth VRAM MB
I was really satisfied w its performance in windows
but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA
especially this new Strike Commander 
this stealth vram can only give me  fps  i use dbench
my winmark was  million i think

so right now i'm considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully
can perform approx same w my current VRAM in windows and also
can perform DOS' VGA preferably fps

i also saw the dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it
in csipg and it looked that SpeedStar X and Orchid Prodesigner ds
ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard
both can give fps in DOS' VGA w dx
Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor
type  which one is the worthiestnot necessarily fastest
any other card recommendation is welcomed too

also if possible where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest 

thanks in advance folks

Stacker achieves better compression ratio than DOS yet the
latter comes with virus detection memory manager and multiple
booting Each of them are not so good as the NAV QEMM or NDOS
in my opinion but with a package of only  it's nice if
haven't yet installed all of those stuffs

Both certainly work with Win

Is anyone out there running a MSDOS system with a LocalTalk board I am on an
Appletalk network hooked up with a DayStar Digital LT MC LocalTalk
Interface Board running on a PS Model  I'm using the AppleShare PC
software for file server and network access It works fine under DOS or the
Window or OS DOS box But when I try to load it before Windows so that
every application I run could get access to it the machine crashes hard as
soon as I start up an application And of course things look pretty hopeless
for OS but who knows 

So does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup

A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning
communicating
between VB and MSACCESS using DDE The answers I received at
that time
allowed me to get a prototype of my project working However
during
this process I have come up with new problems

 There seems to be a limit of  characters for a DDE Topic
string Is
this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS
or VB

 It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the
DDE SQL command
provided the above limitation is overcome by using short
field and table
names but how is one meant to update a database
   a A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work
   b Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command
from VB cannot
      be used because when the macro requests information from
VB using a
      second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time
outs occur
      The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access
to VB channel
      is initiated I guess
   c Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information


   The way I eventually managed to update a database was by
sending key
   strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command This
technique has
   the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must
always be in a
   state ready to respond to the sequence of keystrokes VB
sends

Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect
assumptions
Are there any better work arounds to the above Are there any
signs of an
ODBC driver for Access

Summary after editing winini embedding and leaving only  entry
Organization George Washington University
Date Mon  Apr   GMT

Hey allI got an equation editor and since it didn't automagically
appear in my object dialog box ie insertobjectequation I
decided to manually place it there  So I went into winini is there
another way to do this the embedding section and added 

equationequationequationpathfilenamepicture

didn't work
quit windows go back  AHA mistake Correct it  It looks fine
start windowsdoesn't work  play with it for a while at one point
having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't and finally I
get it to work  The only thing I can see that's different now is that
it's now the first item on the list and it used to be the last  But
now I end up with three equation entried and all of them working
and only one entry in winini

so does any netian know what's wrong or rather how to correct this
ie make equationappear but once

Also all the entries in the embedding appear as above
It's obvious that pathfilename is the executable or whatever and
picture has something to do withthe way it appears
picturedescription

but what are the others
ie in

soundrecsoundsound
whate's the difference between the st sound and the nd  
and what is soundrec I don't think it's the name of the executable
as other entries eg MSWorksChart aren't

thanks ia

Mornin' all  I was wonderin'
I got screenpeace the screensaver which I think is very
good and I got a problem with it
There is an option there realize colour table and if it's
switched on some wallpapers' colours will get ucked up with
some screensavers eg the flashlight one  If I turn it off
however it works well and it's faster so I have it off  All's
nice and well  However If I turn it off then it will be on
again next time I start windows  All the setting are set in the
winini file and I do have save settings on exit selected

also I tried manually changing the setting in the winini file
to n for norealize colour table and started windows  It
will be fine for that session but the next session will again
turn the option on

I tried adding a R readonly attribute to my winini file and
it worked but my bitmap wallpaper saver didn't work then
Actually it's the same application  Anywya it didn't work
since it must change the setting at the winini file

so anyone out there got any answerssuggesionscomments for me

Do you mean the icons of the program groups or the icons of the

latter and the answer is sure you can  Just click once not double
on the application icon then AltF P File  Properties  Click on the
Change Icon box and tell it the icon filename  Or use the Browse

 Can you set up a shortcut key to return to the Program Manager

I use AltTab  Hold the Alt key and repeatedly press Tab until you see

 What a hassle Running on Gateway  DX
 Thx Dave L
 
  
You're using drivers version  or earlier The latest is  available
from their BBS or by snailmail It at least fixes the WfW problem

The reason I wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because
of following I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told
that I can expect a new version near the end of the month Which should be
about now

However I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standard
mode Apparently they don't know of this problem and seem to be surprised
why anybody would want to use standard mode at all


It's a great card for the price at least when I bought it Now there may be
better alternatives

  I had the same problem  At first I thought it was the video driver and 
  made sure I had the most current drivers because the problem was most
  evident at SVGA resolution modes  It didn't help and after a bit of
  experimentation determined that the problem existed in standard VGA
  resolution mode It was just much less noticeable
  
  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in  It
  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications  On the 
  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse I borrowed
  a new mouse a MS bus model and tried it  That solved the problem
  So if your mouse is old you may want to try replacing it for a newer
  one
  

Another alternative is to clean the mouse you've got  Sometimes the
rollers inside the mouse pick up a ball of lint or other debris  Open the
bottom of the mouse take out the ball and use some alcohol on a Qtip to
clean it out  Inspect the inside for any hairs or fuzz  I have had my
mouse get real jumpy and cleared up the problem with this procedure

For a VGA card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them
back and expect it to work  You have to create a new WINCOM file  Try
the command you will have to worry about what directories each file is in
since I don't know your setup

COPY B WINCNFVGALOGOLGOVGALOGORLE WINCOM

I grabbed this from Supercharging Windows by Judd Robbinsgreat book
This is also how you can put your own logo into the Windows startup screen
An RLE file is just a specially compressed BMP file

Hope this helps

Try setting up another HPIII printer but when choosing what port to connect it
to choose FILE instead of like LPT  This will prompt you for a file name
everytime you print with that HPIII on FILE printer Good Luck

Hi I was wondering if anyone out there could help me
I have an error message that goes



What does it mean

I am running MS windows 

Ummm I think you left the message out

I get these protection faults all the time on my machine at work a
 MHz with MB RAM Windows  with Dos   

At home on a  MHz MB RAM Windows  and Dos  I never get
these  

Any idea what could be wrong  Someone already suggested I check for tmp
files in the windowstemp directory there are none there

The message I get is

	This application has violated system integrity due to an invalid
	general protection fault and will be terminated

I only have this problem with applications running in DOS boxes with or
without pif files setup for them

Any hintshelp greatly appreciated  Please post since at least one other
person is also having gpf problems

Thanks
    Gordon

 I thought the files that controlled this were
 
 WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGORLE

 I restored these files but it didn't change the logo  Anyone know what
 the correct files are
 
 Thanks
 

Somewhere ftpcicaindianaedu or SIMTEL mirror there is a program  
called winlogozip that does the trick It works great I believe the  
reason why you can't change the files you mentioned is that the logo is  
actually imbeded into the windows executable Somebody please

Hello

I thought this problem might have something to do with Windows  SMARTDRV and
a VESA video cardany ideas

I recently purchased a DX machine and am having problems where the 
machine will suddenly freeze or reboot  This may happen in Windows  or DOS 
  Sometimes it is after printing a document sometimes after using the 
mouse and sometimes just when I am sitting there  Twice when it happened the 
machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps  I looked in the documentation and 
the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts  The machine has the 
following configuration and files

DX
AMI BIOS

NI SuperVGA Monitor with VESA Windows Accelerator Card w Meg

When the machine freezes I can't use the mouse or keyboard or use CtrlAltDel 
to reboot  If any one can give me any help I would greatly appreciate it  If 
anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency memory wise I 
would appreciate that also

I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom  was using  
I think but switched to  to see if it was any better  Vertical motion

the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about  inch  This is crazy  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be  just venting steam

I think I have the same problem I think it is caused by the rubber ball
in the mouse which doesn't roll so smooth The detectors in the mouse
notice this and whoops I hit a mine using minesweeper  

I think the solution will be buying a new mouse andor using a mouse pad

Wouter


Andor taking the rubber ball out of the mouse should be directions
in the manual or on the bottom of the mouse and cleaning it with
alcohol isopropyl I believe  the same alcohol as used for cleaning
your cassette deck  This is good to do every so often even if you
have a mouse pad  Dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the
rubber ball  As well lint and other garbage may find it's way onto
the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and
vertical sensors

Hope this helps  Good luck

 If I don't put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys I can't access other WWG 
 drives from the filemanager

 It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE  
 statement in my ConfigSys

First off I haven't used WWG but I think that's about to change

The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general and
in this case NETX in particular adds drives to the device chain 
Setting LASTDRIVEZ means there are no unassigned as opposed to
unused drive letters for NetWare to use as it tacks its drive
mappings onto the end of the existing list of drives  WWG obviously
attaches its network drives to existing unused drive letters

I'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVEM which on
most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for WWG and still
allow up to  NetWare drive mappings as well

 ok i have a dxISA w Diamond Stealth VRAM MB
 I was really satisfied w its performance in windows
 but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA
 especially this new Strike Commander 
 this stealth vram can only give me  fps  i use dbench
 my winmark was  million i think
 
 so right now i'm considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully
 can perform approx same w my current VRAM in windows and also
 can perform DOS' VGA preferably fps
 

I am ordering the Actix graphicsengine ultra plus It is the same price
as the stealth card Plus it is also based on S  chip the newest and
fastest chip from s 
Everyone if you are looking for a card SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE
FOR THEIR REVIEW  
They noted this person's problem with dos The stealth card is not a very good
dos performer The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class non local
bus It got glowing reports from the magazine was a best buy and I called
them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week They have
a bulletin board to get the latest drivers 
Though somone posted that this bbs was at  

AT any rate the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards
in the  class based on the winmark results

If you are looking for the all around best doswindows performance  check out
the actix card Their  number is 

PS The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user ie
games then you should also check out the  chip from s It apparently
scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the  chip
ie stealth and actix cards They have comparable windows performance and
are cheaper to buy

I was at the Trenton Computer Fest and there were many sources of

you have a choice  There is a Frequently Asked Question FAQ list
that's reposted occasionally that reports how to refill the cartridges
yourself with inks that are available from the stationery store
instead of a specialty ink with the specialty price

I'm not sure but I think I found another legal source of cheap

To clarify  

VC is considered an upgrade for C  There will be no product
called C  although the commandline compiler of VC lists its
version as   C is not a DOSonly product  it is a CC
compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows as is
VC Pro Ed  The significant difference is that VC comes with
many Windowshosted tools ide etc which assist developers in
creating Windows executables much more quickly basically by
automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code  Initial
impressions have been very favorable

Everyone who is a registered user of C should have received a
considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C If you
haven't call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some

Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro  after running PCTools v
compress  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than
PCCache running so that is not it  The first time I try to run Ami
Pro after loading windows it loads but causes I think it was a 
segmentation fault in AMIPROEXE right before it finishes with all times
after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when
it begins loading and then causes a general protection fault in module
AMIPROUIDLL at   I have not been able to fix this problem except
by reinstalling Ami Pro  This has happened twice with both times being
after having ran compress on my hard drive  BTW I am not running stacker
or any other disk compression programs and if you don't already know
PCTools compress is actually a defragger despite it's name  My system is
a MHz with MB of RAM and a NEC OEM hard drive etc but that
shouldn't make a difference

PLEASE email me as I can't keep up with the newsgroup and it will cut down
on net traffic anyways  Thanks

 If I don't put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys I can't access other WWG

 It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE  
 statement in my ConfigSys
 
 First off I haven't used WWG but I think that's about to change
 
 The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general and
 in this case NETX in particular adds drives to the device chain 
 Setting LASTDRIVEZ means there are no unassigned as opposed to
 unused drive letters for NetWare to use as it tacks its drive
 mappings onto the end of the existing list of drives  WWG obviously
 attaches its network drives to existing unused drive letters
 
 I'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVEM which on
 most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for WWG and still
 allow up to  NetWare drive mappings as well

WWG requires DOS drives  I use LASTDRIVEJ which makes my first Novell drive
K and leaves me drives G H I and J for WWG  My local DOS drives use AF

Well I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was I received 
responses and  requests for summary Thanks to everyone who made it
possible

On my own I was able to find out about Codebase Accsys and QE Codebase
and Accsys are C libraries without SQL QE is a Windows application
that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls where you send a SQL
string and receive the results

Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland Other 
products mentioned were Microsoft's ODBC Accsys Quadbase Codebase
RBASE and QE Only ODBC Quadbase RBASE and QE have SQL

For myself I decided on Codebase mostly because it has an ANSI C
portability version that runs under DOS UNIX etc and includes the
source code and portability is important in my application It works
with DBASE FoxPro or Clipper files

However I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising
It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries and
formatting query results As the responses say it's available via ftp
except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals
the ODBC Programmer's Reference and the ODBC SDK Guide Moreover
ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases that's 
up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers Also
it's Windows only it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK 
Nevertheless it's a start at a SQL interface standard and should
make life interesting in the future

Here's my original post followed by the responses separated by 
a line of asterisks 

 Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing
 their respective databases Paradox FoxPro from within C programs
 I'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it
 to a function which returns the query results in some format Failing
 that any other access would still be better than nothing
 
 I'd also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing
 
 If other people are interested I'll prepare a summary of what I'm
 told and post it
 
 Thanks to all



Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want 
The current version is  which is fully compatible with ack Paradox
  Why the versions are different I don't know PD Engine  was
compatible with Pdox  and   It consists of a rather broad
library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal I think
turbo Pascal  and up and C I think either Microsoft or Borland

Now reading the box it's Borland Paradox Engine  Database
Frameworks  Works with any Borland CC Mocrosoft C  or later
Turbo C for Windows Turbo Pascal  or later TP for Windows  or
later  For Framework applications BC  or later or MS CC  It
does have support for object useage

I haven't had a real chance to really use it myself but it looks fairly
complete I'm planning to use it this summer

The paradox engine I know very well and it definitiely
not a replacement for SQL but it will enable you to
save and restore records has locking et al Supposedly
the Paradox for Windows was impemented on top of it

  MS has put their ODBC SDK into the public domain it's
 big I believe  MB but worth downloading over a
 fast link Look at ftpuunet in vendormicrosoftodbcsdk

 Also some companies are starting to provide SQL engines I
 just got one for RBASE not exactly cheap at  but it
 allows programs in C or VBASIC under DOS or Windows to talk
 to data bases using SQL functions in your code

Paradox Engine is the library  for Paradox 


Artur Babecki
arturiiujedupl



Borland sells the Paradox Engine  which has all the Paradox calls in it
Its hardly SQL though  You can do searches on key fields and on 
indivual fields but no comparison operators like  

so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple
retrieval and insertsupdates

I'm currently using it I have an eval copy and I've linked it in to
some entry screens I've written

The Engine library adds about K to the size of the program but you can
load it as an overlay using Borland's VROOM manager

Now Borland claims that later versions of the engine will have SQL support
but they don't really expect it till late in the year or even next year
They are trying to get thrid parties to help out

If you have any other questions  let me know

Mike Kamlet

Yes borland sells their Paradox Engine separately  It has C C and
Pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in 'C' Well at
least for version  of the Engine which I have costed  at Egghead
They now have version  of the engine and a separate C class package
for it

I've used AccSys for Paradox new version is almost ready for Paradox
 to access Paradox files from C  Its pretty good  Not SQL
though  Have heard of Borland Paradox Engine or some such which is
supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is exactly

Hope this helps good luck

Borland sells their Paradox Engine   It's a library of functions
for accessing paradox DB files  It comes with libraries for
MS C 
BCC 
Turbo Pascal v
and I believe it comes with Turbo PascalWin libraries as well
The C libraries come in both DOS and Windows flavors the win stuff 
being dll's  

When I got it it also came with Crystal Reports which
is a graphical report generator  It allows you to create a generic
form and use it within a compiled program using Pdox Engine  I don't
know if they still offer it or what the current price is I paid 
something like  for an upgrade from the earlier version though

Hope this helps

Borland has the Paradox Engine library  It has libraries for
both C and Pascal to access Paradox files under DOSWindows  
But for Paradox I believe you'd have buy have the SQL Link 
since Pdox itself isn't SQL compliant  I've used the engine 
for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it  
Under DOS it's a real pig  It tacks on about K to the size of 
your programs

I don't know about Microsoft but Borland sells the Paradox Engine for CC 
Pascal in one package  And if you want dBase compatible files there is a

We're using QE database libraries to do what you describe
It's a set of DLL's accessed through a common API to talk to most of the
major database formats We're using it to build an application that

done using SQL The package is available through Microway in Melbourne I

Ie PX Engine  is compatible with Paradox  and downward compat
w  There are indeed C libs for Fox access but I can't think of the
names offhand  I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard 
I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the C Users Journal which
is a good place to look for this type of package in general by the way
I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX Eng over the
past year  wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser appbut I'm
staying with it for nowit's like a bad marriage I've got too much time
invested in learning and workarounds  But if your interest is limited
to a simple singleuser interface you want to build your own SQL engine
I take it PX Engine will do the job easily  it doesn't sound like
you'll be bumping into any of the gotchas  If you do write me I may
be able to point you in the right direction

Borland has a Paradox Engine and Database Framework  which gives you
a C and assembler API to Paradox databases  This is part of BOCA
 Borland's Object Component Architecture  They have technical briefs
on BOCA PdoxEng and other products of theirs

 Can you set up a shortcut key to return to the Program Manager 
    I know CTLESC ESC will do it but I'd rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the PM with ALTF

You might try the recorder and make a micro  I done that to do certain operations 
in a windows app that didn't have the ability to use a micro  It should be in the 
Accessories window  The only problem is that it has to be runing for it to work

Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone but I finally fixed my mouse
jumpiness problems I installed a bus mouse Sorry I didn't say the solution
was free In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse
Cleaning it unloading all kinds of TSRs turning off SMARTDRV write
cacheing changing COM ports  Nothing worked Yesterday I finally broke
down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse The improvement is even better
than I had imagined So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy
all the time I just thought it was jumpy sometimes and I had gotten so
used to it I didn't notice My wife who uses the computer about once a
month noticed the improvement literally within a second

I can't say anything about other bus mice but with the Mouse Systems
one you'll have to give up either COM or LPT to an IRQ Also if you
don't know Mouse Systems mice have three buttons The driver includes
a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button

Hope this helps someone else If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I
was it's well worth the

Surely some one of you is familiar with what a mailorder company goes
through This company has only a few products but thousands of clients
I need a Sales Billing and Receivables program to handle the thing
but I need to be able to customize it myself own the source etc Anyone
willing to sell me the basic stuff in ANY development language I'll
be willing to pay about  to 

It has to be ready now I need this sort of solution immediately With more
time I'll just develop one myself If you can have me a prototype in
two weeks you can make some quick cash

Sorry about that  don't want to alarm anyone

I don't think there is any correlation between the crashes and PCTools
I reinstalled Ami Pro and ran compress again with no problems
I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had
 bytes  left while FTPing although I would think it wouldn't
matter since Ami Pro wasn't running at the time and I made space available
immediately anyways
But whatever the cause it is working now

I really appreciate this information  However given that I don't have

backdeskzip is on CICA but I'm not sure of the whole directory

Another to throw into the running is topdesk  It is alsow on CICA but
I'm not sure where  It is more complicated then backdesk but I've found
it to be more stable and more usefull  I recomend it to people who

I am running Windows  Windows for Work Groups and just loaded Dos 

Whats happening appears as a graphics problem with File Manager  I've
added some menubar buttons but there appears to be a gray boxed region
that covers the top 'rds of the button row  

These buttons are in a row below the pulldown menus  the pulldown menus
look fine and the disk label region looks fine but you only see the bottom
few pixels of the task buttons

Anyone else experience this

We have been having a real problem with an AST sx machine with
mb of RAM  We installed Paradox for Windows but I don't think 
Paradox is the real problem here and the installation went ok
windows is installed on a local drive paradox installed on a novell
network netware  v or greater DOS  Win  but the program
will not load in  enchanted mode  The thermometer bar goes to 
and we then either get a 'invalid commandcom' or a windows nastygram
talking about an illegal instruction  I've checked out the commandcom
thing but as a longtime C programmer I've crashed my share of machines
with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior 

Anyway paradox will run in standard mode but not enhanced  We also have
quattro pro windows exhibiting the same behavior  Spent about  hours
with Borland's tech people with no avail  The guy I talked to a microsoft
didn't want to really dig in and help as he gave up pretty quickly
Somewhat disappointing really  I expected more from Microsoft  You'd think
with all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all
the possible problems but I guess not

Microsoft had sent us a  page fax on fixing UAE and General
Protection faults sorry I can't fax anything out of here so please
don't ask try Microsoft which we tried  We did everything they
said and still no luck

So  If you can help please mail me  This problem is driving us nuts
I will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on

Thanks

I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom  was using  
I think but switched to  to see if it was any better  Vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  I can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about  inch  This is crazy  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Try this  flip your mouse over and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place  Remove the ball and inside you should see
probably  rollers  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
cakedon dirt dust or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them carefully
scrape it off with a small knife Xacto works great  Be Careful
You do not want to gauge the rollers just clean off the dirt
Put the ball back in put the cover on and there you are  

I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here  Another symptom
is that when you move the mouse it seems to click along  If this
doesn't solve your problem at least you have a clean mouse  I highly
recommend using a proper soft mouse pad and if you are a clean freak
place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep
the dust off

Personally I prefer track balls  Oh which brings me to another point
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mousetrackball you may notice
that it will stop working  If this happens to you close the curtains
or blinds or simply shade your pointing device and see if that helps

Petzold's  book says that it is best to use the module instance
handle of the calling program not the module instance handle of the
DLL page 

I have two questions

  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module

  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of
    the DLL

Thanks in advance
Mike

Due to the resolution and size it is in  parts

This is a uuencoded bitmap  X  colors
The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background
The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a x display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture Reguarding image
quality and resolution  I have not seen much better

For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files here
is how to put it back together
	 save the  parts to  individual files
	 use a text editor to remove the header and footer
	   in each file
	 concatinate all the parts into a single file
	 uudecode the file
There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as
uuconvert UNIX and UUcoder Windows  If neccesary I could post
these tools or where to get them by FTP  let me know

I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth  Video card
and received the wrong drivers  Does anyone know where
I can ftp the windows video drivers for the Stealth 
I tried the drivers at cica and they don't work
The right drivers are on the Diamond BBS but the file is almost
 meg and it would take a while to download them
at  baud  Any information would be appreciated  Please
contact me at dougsunswsuiucedu

Thank you

Doug Ward

gnuplot etc make it easy to plot real valued functions of  variables
but I want to plot functions whose values are vectors I have been 
doing this by plotting arrays of arrows complete with arrowheads but
before going further I thought I would ask whether someone has already
done the work Any pointers

Can someone please tell me where I can ftp DTA or DMORPH

DMorf Dave's Morph I think is what it means and DTax Dave's 
TGA Assembler are available in the MSDOSUPLOADS directory
on the wuarchive

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions
dmorfxexe and dtaxexe you can also find a version of aaplayexe
there with which you can view files you create with dtaexe or
dtaxexe

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
away the afternoons since  The programmes are all a bit buggy and
definitely notreadytospreadtothemasses but they are very
well written 

The interface is frustrating at first but it gets easy once you
figure out the tricks

I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option  Not sure why since I don't have
the source  I think it was written for TP 

If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right tell me it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then 
it would work

Hello
     I am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface I am
developing on an HP UNIX workstation  I would greatly appreciate 
information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are 
easily accessible from the UNIX environment 

     The names or adresses of applicable vendors as well as any 
experiences you have had with specific systems would be very helpful

     Please respond via email I will post a summary if there is 
sufficient interest


Thanks
Ken


PS  I have found several impressive systems for IBM PC's but I would 
like to avoid the hassle of purchasing and maintaining a separate PC if 
at all possible

FTP the source code and which is the newest version around
        Also I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman 
is like SIPP  ie a library of rendering routines which one uses to make

There ARE situiations where you get visible machbanding even in
a  bit card If
you create a very smooth color gradient of darkgreenwhiteyellow
or something and turn
up the contrast on the monitor you will probably see some machbanding

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected

    Mach banding will occur for any image  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side

Hello everybody 

If you are using PIXAR'S RenderMan D scene description language for creating D worlds please help me 

I'm using RenderMan library on my NeXT but there is no documentation about NeXTSTEP version of RenderMan available I can create very complicated scenes and render them using surface shaders 
but I can not bring them to life by applying shadows and reflections

As far as I understand I have to define environmental and shadows maps to produce reflections and shadows but I do not know how to use them

Any advises or simple RIB or C examples will be appreciated
Thanks in advance

    I think you're proposal would work to get an extra one maybe two extra
bits of color resolution  However if you had a display that chould do only
zero or full intensity for each primary I don't think you'd get great
equivalent bit photographs

I have not suggested to do so I wrote about problems and the problem
were clearly visible with  bit bw images not to mention  bit images

 description of experiment deleted 

If the  bit images are viewed quickly and in sync with screen
then  intensities could be better than we have  I dunno

 more deleted 

In any case getting black color with slow machines is problem
I could try it on our  bit screens but I don't know how to
render pixels with X in constant time I recall our double buffer
has other image color and one bw  that doesn't help either
Maybe I should dump photos to screen with low level code how

A few years ago a friend and I took some  greylevel photos from
a  bit Mac Plus screen using this method Displaying all  levels
synchronized to the Hz display took about  seconds After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well giving respectable
contrast The quality of the images was pretty good There were no
visible contrast bands

To minimize the exposure time the display program built 
different  bit frames The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value  the second only for pixels that had value 
etc These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence Creating these
frames sometimes took  minutes on that old Mac but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway And yes we wrote
directly to the screen memory Mea culpa

Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print Who'd have guessed

This requires the same total exposure time and the same precision in

A DO marketing rep recently offered a Phillips marketing rep a 
bet that DO would have boxes on the market on schedule  The Phillips
rep declined the bet probably because he knew that DO players are
already in preproduction manufacturing runs  months before the
commercial release date

By the time of commercial release there will be other manufacturers of
DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production  Chip
sets will be in full production  The number of software companies
designing titles for the box will be over 

How do I know this  I was at a bar down the road from DO headquarters
last week  Some folks were bullshitting a little too loudly about
company business

All this information is third hand or so and worth what you paid for it
This is second hand but it still hard to look to the future

I use xwdxpr from the XR dist and various programs of the
ppmtools to print hardcopies of colored X windows My problem is

I don't like xpr It gives at least the XR version does louzy
output the hardcopy looks very grainy to me
Instead I use pnmtops This takes full advantage PostScript and
lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a graylevel
image to black and white dots

So if you have a PostScript printer try
	xwdtopnm xwdfile 	 convert to PPM
	ppmtopgm 		  to graylevel for smaller file to print
	pnmtops noturn 	  to PostScript
	lpr			 print

pnmtops Has several neat options but use them with care
If you want your image to be  wide use
	pnmtops noturn scale  width 
noturn Prevents the image from being rotated if it is wider than it
	is high
width  Specifies the PAPER width not the image width  see below
scale  Is used because if the image is small it may fit within a
	width less than  and will thus be printed smaller than  wide
	If you first scale it up a lot it will certainly not fit in  and
	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
	paper width 
	In short pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size
	but it will not blow it up automatically

Hope this helps

By ' grey level images' you mean  items of bit images

With  bit per pixel there could be c  c timing

compinations  there's  levels but  choises best  must be
chosen Different compinations for the same level varies a bit but
the levels keeps their order

Actually I am trying to write something like this but I encounter some
problems amongst them

 drawing a d wireframe view of a quadricquartic requires that you have
the explicit equation of the quadricquartic x y z functions of some
parameters How to convert the implicit equation used by PoV to an
explicit one Is it mathematically always possible

I don't have enough math to find out by myself has anybody heard about
useful books on the subject

 Hi
 
 I will be writing a data acquisition program to collect data from a
 variety of sources including RS and external AD's and I would
 like to be able to display the data in near realtime  I've done this
 type of thing on PC's and other machines but I am unaware of any graphics
 package that could help me with this on a UNIX machine
 
 
 
 Does anyone have any ideas on commercial or free packages that might
 suit my needs  I would really appreciate any input  I'm sure this has
 been done many times before
 

  For a commerical package try WAVE from  Precision Visuals
                                           

  For a free package try KHOROS from University of New Mexico

                              ptrgeeceunmedu

    Login in anonyomus or ftp  with a valid email address as the password
               cd pubkhorosrelease

   That will get you to the right place

This is a universal VESA driver  It supports most video
boardschipsets include the Speedstar and X up to
 bit color

Terry

PS  I've tried it on a Speedstar and X and it works 

Not with all software  For instance it doesn't work at all with
Animator Pro from Autodesk It can't detect ANY SVGA modes when 
running UniVESA This is really a problem as we need a VESA driver
for both AA Pro and some hicolor stuff 

Just out of curiosity Are you using the latest version   Versions
previous to this did not fill in all of the capabilities bits and other
information correctly  I had problems with a lot of software until I got
this version  I don't think the author got around to posting an 
announcementof it or at least I missed it but  was available in the 
directory indicated as of 

I sure did use version  It works fine with most software but NOT
with Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me Pretty
useless program without that thing working IMHO
So I hope the author can fix that

Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same
direction  ie On a closed cube all normals point outwards  You can use
the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal by making
sure that all points are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order

How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a 
set of points edges and faces   Say that you had a cube with all faces that 
have their normals facing outwards except for one face  What's the
best way to realize that face is flipped and should have it's points
reordered   I thought I had a good way of telling this but then realized
that the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise
order for a d polygon  I'd like something for d data

Any hints tips references would be appreciated

How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a 
set of points edges and faces 

Look for edge inconsistencies  Consider two vertices p and q which
are connected by at least one edge

If pq is an edge then qp should not appear  

If both pq and qp appear as edges then the surface flips when
you travel across that edge  This is bad  

Assuming warningwarningwarning that you have an otherwise
acceptable surface  you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the
surface enforcing consistency with that edge  

     pick an edge pq and mark it as OK
     for each face F containing this edge if more than  oops
       make sure that all edges in F are consistent ie the Face
       should be pqqrrssttp  Flip those which
       are wrong Mark all of the edges in F as OK
       and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially
       inconsistencies  don't let the queue have both pq and qp 
     remove an edge from the queue and go to 

If a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you lose

If step  finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you
lose 
    
Otherwise when done all of the edges will be consistent  Which means
that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT  Deciding
which way is OUT is left as an exercise

How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a 
set of points edges and faces

This algorithm works well for me

Algorithm to attempt to find outwardfacing normals

First mark all faces as UNKNOWN

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the
faces sharing a given edge where an edge is two integers representing
the two shared vertices

Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTERCLOCKWISE  Using the edge
dictionary orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of
this face  And recurse for all surrounding faces consistently
orienting the entire surface

Find the average of the vertices in this surface  Using that point
calculate a volume measurement taking into account the face's
orientation  If the volume turns out to be positive assume the faces
are oriented correctly  If it is negative reverse their orientations
mark them CLOCKWISE

If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this choose another face
and go through the algorithm again

At the end faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed
before facet normals are found

Note if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the
IRIS Inventor D toolkit developers package you have the source to
this algorithm see usrsrcInventortoolsivnorm  If you're
not sorry I can't give out the source and even if I could it
relies heavily on Inventor

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected

    Mach banding will occur for any image  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side

Andre

Yeah of course The term 'mach banding' was not the correct one it should've
been 'color quantization effect' Although a bad color quantization effect could
result in some visible machbands on a picture that was smooth before it was
quantizised

 One thing  a small change in initial conditions can cause a huge
 change in final conditions  There are certain things about the way
 the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that
 is while not entirely random unpredictable  This is also true with
 fractals so one could also conclude that you could model this
 fractally 

Yeah and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events
calculations or big computer programs in general  I don't argue
that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals I
just question whether you should

The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we
can't model should be replaced with a random number generator  That
has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human
perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but I don't
think it has much to do with fractals and I certainly would rather
that the model be improved in a more explicable manner

I guess I just haven't seen all these earthshaking fractal models
that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists  I
really hope I do but I'm not holding my selfsimilar breath

 There is one other thing that fractals are good for  fractal
 image compression

Uh huh  I'll believe it when I see it  I've been chasing fractal
compression for a few years and I still don't believe in it  If it's so
great how come we don't see it competing with JPEG  'Cause it can't
I'll wager

Actually I have wagered I quit trying to make fractal compression
work and I was trying because I don't think it's a reasonable
alternative to other techniques  It is neat though 

I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal  That's why I
don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is

You'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing
in the new colours

Use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g  b values in the range
from  for most cards for a particular palette colour in the
range from  for  colour modes

Then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and
the result should be ok

You might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have
more than  unique rgb triplets for a  colour mode

Hi

I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor
It is known that the display response of tubes is nonlinear and is
sometimes said to follow GammaLaw I am not certain if these
nonlinearities are Gammacorrected before encoding NTSC signals
or if the TV display is supposed to correct this
 
Also if   grey levels for example are coded in a C program do
these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC
monitor In other words does PC monitor display circuitry
correct for gamma errrors
 
Your response is much appreciated

 According to the TIFF  Specification the TIFF version number

 significance
 Last week I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy
 Is this actually how they picked the number 

I'm sure it is and I am not amused  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec it infuriates me and I'm none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway because I think their arbitrary but
carefully chosen number is neither  Additionally I find their
choice of  bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves why
not just use the letters TIFF

And no I don't think they should have bothered to support both word
orders either and I've found that many TIFF readers actually
don't

It's supposedly a highperformance chip based upon workstation graphics
accelerators  It's quite fast I have  but as usual with new boardschips
the drivers are buggy for Windows  As far as Winmarks go it depends upon
the version  I think I got M winmarks with version    yielded the
 number  I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over  from memory
as well

As far as the lowlevel stuff goes it looks pretty nice  It's got this
quadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points

It's very fast but beware of buggy drivers and otherwise no nonwindows
support

It is used to create a TIN triangulated irregular network which is
basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of

Is there a collection of forms routines that can be used with curses
If so where is it located

On my SVR Amiga Unix box I've got lform lmenu and lpanel for
use with the curses library  Guess what they provide 

Unix Press ie PrenticeHall has a programmer's guide for these
tools referred to as the FMLI Forms Mgmt Language Interface and
ETI Extended Terminal Interface now in it's nd edition  It is
ISBN 

Paraphrased from the outside back cover

    FMLI is a highlevel programming tool for creating menus forms
    and text frames  ETI is a set of screen management library
    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
    for window panel menu and form manipulation

The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
screen displays for data entry and presentation  It consists of a
shelllike environment of the fmli program and it's database
files  It is section F in the Unix Press manual

The ETI are subroutines part of the X manual section provide
support for a multiwindow capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
with controls built on top of the curses library

you can have animated brushmapsie live video mapped on the objs
also animated backdrops ie live video backgrounds
also animted reflections maps

you get the idea it will run for about  retail I think

dont let the low price fool you this product can do it all when it

	Ahh no  Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your
calculator   color modes take a byte per pixel so  time  is
 which is k to be exact  xx only takes k but I
don't think it is a BIOS mode  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do
that either  If a VGA card has k I bet it can do both x and
x  That by definition is SVGA though not very high SVGA

What Chance's Art'' D Graphics and Animation on the Indigo

By    Ken Evans Imagicians Artware Inc

Abstract

Imagicians Artware Inc is entering into early beta site testing on Silicon 
Graphics workstations of a new D abstract artwork and animation package called 
Chance's Art  The package will be described and demonstrated and some of the 
technical issues will be discussed  Marketing plans will be outlined  The 
talk will also present some of the technical and business problems increasingly 
confronting small startup software companies today and some of the 
opportunities this situation presents

The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC  You'll want version  or later  x is current  It allows you to view in  and  bit modes  It really is QUITE nice

Now for a return question  Do you run Windows  If so what are the dates on your drivers  The newest ones I can find are from around   My problem is they conflict with Star Trek After Dark and other things as well  I'm willing to bet that it's the drivers and NOT the programs  Anyone out there have info on newer SS NOT X drivers for windows or OS

I have posted a DOS MPEG decoderplayer to altbinariespicturesutilities

Here is a short description and some technical information taken from the
accompanying documentation


                              DMPEG V

                       Public Domain MPEG decoder

                           by Stefan Eckart


 Features


DMPEGDMPLAY is another MPEG decoderplayer for the PC


  decodes nearly the full MPEG video standard
   IPB frames frame size up to at least x supported

  saves decoded sequence in  or bit raw file for later display

  optional onscreen display during decoding requires VGA

  several dithering options ordered dither FloydSteinberg grayscale

  colorspace selection

  runs under DOS KB RAM no MSWindows required

  very compact small code  small data models  bit arithmetic

  real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
   VGA and many SuperVGAs



 Technical information


The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec 
The IDCT is based on the ChenWang  multiplication algorithm 
not quite the optimum I know Blocks with not more than eight nonzero
coefficients use a nonseparated direct multiplyaccumulate DIDCT
sounds great doesn't it which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'
algorithm in this quite common case Dithering is pretty standard Main
difference to the Berkeley decoder except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms is the use of  instead of  colors the default option to
use a restricted colorspace and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither This leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image I claim judge yourself

Restricted colorspace means that the U and V components are clipped to
 instead of  and the display colorspace points are distributed
over this restricted space Since the distance between colorspace points
is thus reduced by a factor of two the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors

Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation This yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve
on NTSC The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas

Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon UNDECIDABLE
	by Dave Baraff Tom Duff

	From debcharismagraphicscornelledu
	Newsgroups compgraphics
	Keywords P NP Jordan curve separation Ursyhon Metrization Theorem
	Organization Program of Computer Graphics

In article  ncsmithndsuvaxUUCP Timothy Lyle Smith writes

  I need to find a formulaalgorithm to determine if a line intersects
  a polygon  I would prefer a method that would do this in as little
  time as possible  I need this for use in a forward raytracing
  program

I think that this is a very difficult problem  To start with lines and
polygons are semialgebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points  Here are a few offthecuff ideas

First we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated  Now the
Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open and thus noncompact regions  Thus the line lies
completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon
or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon

Now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so
this is a decision problem  One possibility the decision model approach is
to reduce the question to some other well known problem Q and then try to
solve Q  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem

In recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called PostScript  See PostScript Language by Adobe Systems
Incorporated ISBN   co 

So given a line L and a polygon P we can write a PostScript program that
draws the line L and the polygon P and then outputs the answer  By
output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon  A quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q and thus
the original problem

There are two small problems with this approach 

	 There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the
	reduced problem Q  So we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of
	Choice or equivalently Zorn's Lemma  But the use of the Axiom of
	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days

	 More importantly the question arises as to whether or not the
	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper or in
	other words will it halt

	Now PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
	Turing Machine might do thus the halting problem for PostScript is
	undecidable  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn
	out to be undecidable


I won't even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite
precision and running out of ink paper or both

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests he should know
better he's hung around The Labs for long enough  By the well known
DobbinDullman reduction see J Dullman  D Dobbin J Comp Obfusc
ii  pp  lemma a linepolygon intersection can be reduced to
Hamiltonian Circuit without the use of Grobner bases so LPI to coin an
acronym is probably only NPcomplete  Besides Turingcompleteness will no
longer be a problem once our Cray is delivered since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in  milliseconds with scattergather



From debsvaxcscornelledu David Baraff

Well sure its no worse than NPcomplete but that's ONLY if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its
second derivative  I think there's an ' SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that
deals with this

 I am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a 
 polygon Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing
 information on the subject 
 
 		Regards
 
 			Simon

Basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside
outside or on the polygon The first one is Ray or half line method In
this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point
of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside If the number is odd
then it is inside Of cause you have to deal with the special cases which
may make you headache

The second method is PI algorithm Draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon Calculate and sum the angles of the
successive lines If the result is PI then it is inside If PI then
it is on the polygon Otherwise it is outside

My experience tells the second method is relible

Hope this helps

          Is there any way to connect two pointing devices to one serial
          port I haven't tried this but I believe they would interfere
          with each other  even if only one at a time would be used

 	Just get an AB switch for RS Look in Computer Shopper
 They are available fairly cheap They allow switching between two
 serial devices on a single port

Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so a
switch isn't going to help them  If you aren't using your com ports for
anything else just define them on different com ports  Define your internal
modem to be say com and your external modem to be com  You really
shouldn't have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you won't be using
both modems at the same time

That's a typical claim though they say they've improved
compression speed considerably  Did you find out anything else

Reportedly early fractal compression times of  hours used

 According to the TIFF  Specification the TIFF version number

 Last week I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy
 Is this actually how they picked the number 

I'm sure it is and I am not amused  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec it infuriates me and I'm none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway because I think their arbitrary but
carefully chosen number is neither  Additionally I find their
choice of  bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves why
not just use the letters TIFF

And no I don't think they should have bothered to support both word
orders either and I've found that many TIFF readers actually
don't

ab

Why so up tight  FOr that matter TIFF is out now so why not gripe
about its problems  Also if its so important to you volunteer to
help define or critique the spec

Finally a little numerology   is  backwards and TIFF is a  bit

Sorry I missed you Raymond I was just out in Dahlgren last month

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics so perhaps I
can help a little

In article Marrelaynswcnavymil
rchuinswcwonswcnavymil Raymond Chui writes
 Hello the real reality Our agency started to express interest in
 virtual realityVR  So far we do not know much about VR  All we
 know about are the Hollywood movies The Terminater  and Lawnmover
 Man  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and
 Computer Graphics World magazine


Unfortunately while SGI systems were used to create the special effects
for both Terminator  and Lawnmower Man those are filmquality computer
graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time  Each
frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
highend parallel processing computer systems Thus that level of graphics
would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time  frames
per second


 
 We certainly want to know more about VR  Who are the leading
 companies
 agencies universities  What machines support VR ie SGI Sun
 HP BIM etc


It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is
True immersive visualization VR requires the rendering of complex visual
databases at anywhere from  to  newly rendered frames per second  This
is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
training If the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of
the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion
of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous  Thus the graphics system
must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
data representations

Additionally the frame rate must be constant  If the system renders 
frames per second at one point then  frames per second the next perhaps
due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the
graphics computer rather than focusing on the data To maintain a constant
frame rate the system must be able to run in realtime  UNIX in general
does not support realtime operation but Silicon Graphics has modified the
UNIX kernel for its multiprocessor systems to be able to support realtime
operation bypassing the usual UNIX process prioritymanagement schemes 
Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support realtime
operation not Sun SPARC not HP  Series systems not IBM RS not
even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson Only our
multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support realtime operation due
to their Symmetric MultiProcessing SMP sharedmemory architecture

From a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments
requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and realtime
multisample antialiasing  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems
on the market today only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine
systems fully support these capabilities The antialiasing is particularly
important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment


  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR
 GL opengl Phigs PEX GKS etc

You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
VR applications but that is starting at a pretty low level There are
offthe shelf software packages available to get you going much faster
being targeted directly at the VR application developer Some of the most
popular are in no particular order

	 Division Inc		    Redwood City CA  dVS
	 Sens Inc		    Sausalito CA     WorldToolKit
	 Naval Postgraduate School Monterey CA      NPSnet FREE
	 Gemini Technology Corp    Irvine CA        GVS Simation Series
	 Paradigm Simulation Inc  Dallas TX        VisionWorks AudioWorks
	 Silicon Graphics Inc	    Mountain ViewCA  IRIS Performer

There are some others but not off the top of my head

	
 What companies are making
 interface devices for VR goggles or BOOM Binocular OmniOrientational
 Monitor hamlets gloves arms etc

There are too many to list here but here is a smattering

	 Fake Space Labs	    Menlo ParkCA     BOOM
	 Virtual Technologies Inc Stanford CA      CyberGlove
	 Digital Image Design	    New York NY      The Cricket D input

 What are those company's
 addresses and phone numbers  Where we can get a list name of VR
 experts
 and their phone numbers and Email addresses

 Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon UNDECIDABLE
 	by Dave Baraff Tom Duff
 
 	From debcharismagraphicscornelledu
 In recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
 new language called PostScript  See PostScript Language by Adobe Systems
 Incorporated ISBN   co 
 
 So given a line L and a polygon P we can write a PostScript program that
 draws the line L and the polygon P and then outputs the answer  By
 output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which
 actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon  A quick
 examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q and  
thus
 the original problem

Curiously in modern PostScript the point in a polygon problem can
be solved even more easily  To wit

 This program will test whether a point is inside a given polygon
 Currently it uses the evenodd rule but that can be changed by
 replacing ineofill with infill  These are Level  operators
 so if you've only got Level  you're out of luck

 The result will be printed on the output stream

Hi everyone

I thought that some people may be interested in my VR
software on these groups

Announcing the release of Multiverse

Multiverse is a multiuser nonimmersive XWindows based Virtual Reality
system primarily focused on entertainmentresearch

Features

   ClientServer based model using Berkeley Sockets
   No limit to the number of users apart from performance
   Generic clients
   Customizable servers
   Hierachical Objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources
   Multiple light sources ambient point and spot
   Objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily
        attached

Functionality

  Client
   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop Basically it changes things
   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's
   viewpoint It also provides the server with information about the user's
   actions  which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to
   other users

   The client is designed to be generic  in other words you don't need to
   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world This means that
   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting
   it The adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers

   This release of the client software supports the following functionality

    o Hierarchical Objects with associated addressing

    o Multiple Light Sources and Types Ambient Point and Spot

    o User Interface Panels

    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading optional wireframe for
	faster frame rates

    o Mouse and Keyboard Input

   Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the
   PowerGlove as an input device  this is not because it can't but because
   I don't have one This will however be one of the first enhancements

  Servers
   This is where customization can take place The following basic support is
   provided in this release for potential world server developers

    o Transparent Client Management

    o Client Message Handling

   This may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of
accepting and
   terminating clients and receiving messages from them  the
application writer
   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally

   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality This is
   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects

    o Server Selectable Extension Installation
        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended
        functionality in your world Basically you call the extension
        initialisers you want

    o Event Handler Registration
        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback
        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to
        Current events supported INIT MOVE CHANGE COLLIDE  TERMINATE

    o Collision Detection Registration
        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide
        some basic information to the collision detection management software
        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs

    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because
    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects
    from which to choose

    The following is all you need to make a World Server application

    o Provide an initWorld function
        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus
        any initialization you want to do

    o Provide a positionObject function
        This is where you determine where to place a new client

    o Provide an installWorldObjects function
        This is where you load the world wld file for a new client

    o Provide a getWorldType function
        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have

    o Provide an animateWorld function
        This is where you can go wild At a minimum you should let the objects
        move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit
        to avoid outrunning the clients

    That's all there is to it And to prove it here are the line counts for the
    three world servers I've provided

        generic   lines
        dactyl   lines more complicated collision detection due to the
                           stairs Will probably be improved with future
                           versions
        dogfight   lines

Location

   This software is located at the following site
   ftpuwashingtonedu

   Directory
   pubvirtualworlds

   File
   multiversetarZ

Futures

   Client

    o Texture mapping

    o More realistic rendering ie ZBuffering or similar Gouraud shading

    o HMD support

    o Etc etc

   Server

    o Physical Modelling gravity friction etc

    o Enhanced Object ManagementInteraction

    o Etc etc

   Both

    o Improved Comms

I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse
software
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and I'm not sure
whether that will ever be able to be rectified 

I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of
the Virtual Universe  I've certainly found fascinating developing it and I
would LOVE to add support for the PowerGloveand an HMD 

Finally one major disclaimer

This is totally amateur code By that I mean there is no support for this code
other than what I out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure
desperation provide I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad
that may happen through the use of this code  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK

Disclaimer over

Of course if you love it I would like to here from you And anyone with
POSITIVE contributionscriticisms is also encouraged to contact me Anyone who
hates it  devnull



And if anyone wants to let me do this for a living you know where to
write 



Thanks

Robert

In regards to fractal commpression I have seen  fractal compressed movies
They were both fairly impressive  The first one was a  gray scale movie of
Casablanca it was MB and had  minutes of  fps video  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all  The second one I saw was only  minutes but it
had  bit color with fps and measured in at MB

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore  But unlike many 
other formats out there you do end up losing resolution  I don't know what
kind of softwarehardware was used for creating the movies I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took  minutes per frame to generate  But as
I said above playback was  or more frames per second  And how else could you
put  minutes on one floppy disk

davidrrinconemarockwellcom
My opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case I 
will probably change my mind

This past week I've been playing with some of the RD Reaction
Diffusion not to be confused with RDS or RD techniques
from SIGGRAPH '

I was wondering what material is available to explain the control
mechanism a little more  It seems to me very much like a matter of
picking random magic numbers and sitting back and waiting  Although
both of the papers Turk and Witkin  Kass were very well organized
and extremely helpful I guess what I need is a more basic description
of the technique especially wrt the control mechanisms  The tests
that I did had a tendency to either turn into blurry mud or become
unstable

Is there any info available online  Source code would be great but
not necessary

Thanks

I need to implement an algorithm to fractally generate clouds
as sort of a benchmark for some algorithms I'm working on

Just as a matter of interest a selfpromo computer graphics sequence 
that one of the local TV stations used to play quite a lot a couple of
years ago showed a D flyover of Australia from the West coast to the
East  The clouds were quite recognisable as fuzzy flat white

Yes but a key issue is SPEED how fast is Imagine And is it as easy to

etc I was just wondering what other sharewarefreeware raytracers are
out there and what can they do I've heard of Vivid and Polyray and 
Rayshade and so on but I'd rather no wade through several hundred pages of 
manual for each trying to work out what their capabilities are Can anyone
help A comparison of tracing speed between each program would also be 
mucho useful

 I would be most thrilled if some kind person could help me with the following
 Given a cylinder in D defined as a line segment between two points and
 a radius eg SxSySz to ExEyEz and r what is the easiest and not
 too expensive way to find if a ray defined as another line through two
 points cuts through this cylinder and if so where 

 I think the test for touching is rather simple if the closest approach
 of the two lines is less than r then the ray does penetrate the cylinder

Nope this won't work for a cylinder You can have a line arbitrarily close
to the the cylinder backbone and yet not intersect it The test works for a
pillbox though a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends

  Did you say DEC Alpha  Upgrade path from

	Not totally fair  you haven't mentioned the DECstation

an upgrade path to an Onyx

I agree with you about the upgrade path but I think I was fair

The original posting complained  about SGI coming out with newer and
better architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones
and  that DEC did

On statement  I merely attempted to point out that all computer
companies are constantly attempting to improve their product  market
positionshare  In so doing they eventually come to a point where they
have a new architecture and the only upgrade path is to replace the
system  And the particular system he was complaining about was in
computer lifetimes relatively old

On statement  I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far
superior than the industry average and that in my opinion SGI's
history is better than DEC's

And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line  Are they
going to abandon it for their Alpha based line or provide an upgrade
path to R's and TFP's and R's

Hi

  I'm looking for an algorithm that would generate a good crosssection of
RGB colours given a limited colour map size 

The problem I'm writing an application for the PC that may have at most 
colors I want to use one colormap palette for the application but I'd like
it to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum I could use 
a xx RGB cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost
identical to the human eye 

Does anyone know how I can optimize my choice of colors

The original posting complained  about SGI coming out with newer and

And every time I look at it I'm going to think about SGI and how I

Subject d GrafSys  in incoming directory
A d GrafSys short description follows

Programmers D GrafSys Vers  now available 

Version  is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users THIS VERSION
NOW RUNS WITH THINK C I PROMISE The Docs now contain a chapter for
C programmers on how to use the GrafSys If you have problems feel free 
to contact me
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from
the FPU version to make it run faster

Those of you who don't know what all this is about read on



Programmers D GrafSys  What it is


Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing threedimensional scenes 

Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of threedimensional molecules

And didn't the task of writing your D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes but what has it to 
do with this package'  read on

GrafSys is a THINK PascalC library that provides you with simple routines 
for building saving loading as resources and manipulating 
independent rotating around arbitrary achses translating and scaling 
three dimensional objects Objects not just simple singleline drawings

GrafSys supports full D clipping animation and some primitive hidden
linehiddensurface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections If you can't understand a word don't worry this is just showing
off for those who know about it The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to

GrafSys  comes in two versions One for the  and  or above 
processors The other version uses fixedpoint arithmetic and runs on any Mac
Both versions are  source compatibel 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of D
graphics and how to use the package

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an objectclass library 
However I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'OOPGuild'

GrafSys is free for any noncommercial usage Read the documentation enclosed


Enjoy

Yes there are serveral programs which can convert font files eq the Borland
fonts to objects consisting of spheres cones etc 
I've used a program forgot its nameplace but i can look for it which
converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers Vivid POV and
Polyray which i like more more flexibelfasteruse of expressions etc
The program has a lot nice features

A book that I can somewhat recommend is 
                     
                     Pratical Image Processing in C
                     by Craig A Lindley
                     published by Wiley

It addresses readingwriting tofrom PCXTIFF files image acquisition 
manipulation and storage and has source code in the book The source is 
primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities I 
have converted some of it to Quick C Naturally the code has some problems 
in the book  as usuall Typos syntax etc are problems It can be a good 
learning experience for someone who is studying C There is also a companion 
disk with source available for order and  Overall the book is not 
bad I acquired the book at WaldenSoftware

Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi PU video printer and I could use some
help with it  We bought this thing because it  has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and  claimed to print  gray
level images  However the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print  and  bitpixel images  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an HewlettPackard workstation and I can print  and 
bitpixel images just fine  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs  This was not mentioned in the sales literature  However they
did say the PU can do  bitpixel  level images in parallel mode but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so and they
would call Japan etc

Frankly I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do  bitpixel images
from the video source it can't store  bitspixel in the memory  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more  If anybody has any information on
getting  bitpixel or even  bitpixel images out of this thing I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me

Thanks

 My
 comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other
 vendors
 that supported OpenGL rather than deal further with SGI

OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable
interface for the development of interactive D graphics applications It
is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly
from machine to machine and vendor to vendor  SGI is committed to high
performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so OpenGL
means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms there is no
guarantee that your performance would be comparable

 
 What I am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
 we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
 Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck

If your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a
valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI
sales management team Feel free to contact the local branch managerwe
understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a
shot

 
 I'm also annoyed about being sold several Personal IRISes at a
 previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around
 for a while rather than being flushed

As one of the previous posts stated the Personal IRIS was introduced in
 and grew to include the D D D and D as clock rates
sped up over time As a rule of thumb SGI platforms live for about 
years This was true of the motorolabased  series '' the PI
'' the Professional Series the early D's  '' the Power
Series parallel systems '' Individual CPU subsystems running at a
particular clock rate usually live for about  years New graphics
architectures at the high end GT VGX RealityEngine are released every
 months to  years

These are the facts of life  If we look at these machines they become
almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new
platform like Indigo Onyx Challenge which has higher bus bandwidths
faster CPUs faster graphics and IO and larger disk capacities If we
don't we become uncompetitive

From the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your
current needs and makes economic sense today  You can't wait to buy but
if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the Sales Rep
for one in writing If it's feasible they should be able to do that Some
of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as
the Performance Protection Program for older Rbased Power Series
multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain
a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge
Rbased bit multiprocessor systems

 
 Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to
 keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that I found myself
 pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
 just before the end of the quarter but I'm just a little tired of
 getting boned in the process
 

If that's happening it's becausing of misunderstandings or
miscommunication not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our
customer base

 Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies so we
 aren't entitled to a peek under the covers as the Big Kids NASA
 for instance are  This lab and I suspect that a lot of other labs
 and organizations doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers
 every year so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis

Most SGI customers are onesytwosey types but regardless we rarely give a
great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because
again like a previous post stated if we preannounced and the schedule
slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were
counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and
would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial
analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our
commitments

 The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
 entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond That
 means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I
 have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one
 previous poster's words 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other
 vendor  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years
 And every time I look at it I'm going to think about SGI and how I
 could have better spent my money actually your money since we're
 supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars
 

Five years is an awfully long time in computer years New processor
technologies are arriving every  years making a  year old computer at
least  and probably  generations behind the times The competitive nature
of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is
really  years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability
of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor

There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live
with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don't give up
we know it

Hello
  I've been trying to bump map a gif onto a sphere for a while and I
can't seem to get it to work  Image mapping works but not bump
mapping  Here's a simple file I was working with could some kind
soul tell me whats wrong with this

NOTE surfgif is a plasma fractal from Fractint that is using the
landscape palette map

Hi

Can anybody suggest robust algorithmscode for computing the point of intersection
on n d lines in a plane The data has outliers and hence a simple least squares
technique does not seem to provide satifactory results

Please respond by email and I will post the summary to the newsgroups
if there is sufficient interest

Thanks

This program doesn't detect edges with compass operators and a laplacian
operator It should output  raw greyscale images with edges The output
doesn't look like edges at all

In novicee terms how do I correct the errors Any improvements are welcome
I'll even accept your corrected code

If I convolve the INPUTIMAGE with a digital gaussian  by  to remove
noise will I get an improvement with the laplacian

Hi Steve

As the author of Multiverse I feel I had better respond to your
mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this
software  the quick answer is yes The long answer is yes  but a
few have had a few problems with their platforms  not all unix's are
the same you know As far as many bugs go it would probably be more
useful to everyone including you if you were a bit more explicit 

Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are RS Dec Ultrix
Sun Solaris so it is possible

The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the
RS so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear
about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to
how to fix it

As far as the software not doing anything do you really think I would
bother releasing it if that was the case Perhaps you didn't read the
few docs that ARE supplied The dogfight world is made up of clients
only so if you're in there on your own then you're not going to see
anything The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary  so if you don't
see anything there then this is definitely a problem

One final word  if you're not interested don't bother with it
If you are interested then please remember that I'm not asking for
any money So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism
maybe that will get results

Robert

I don't think speed has been determined since it has never run on Intel chips
But on the Amiga's Motorola Chips it was one of the fastest true 'Ray Tracers'

I don't think Impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration

In terms of features and learning curve ALL that you stated for DS is also
true for Imagine and lots more But I'll have to admit that after  years of
use on the Amiga the learning curve is very steep This is due ONLY to the
manual It is realy BAD However there is a lot of after market support for
this product including regular 'Tips' articles in many magazines such as AVID
and a great book by Steve Worley called Understanding Imagine  This book i
is not just recommened IT IS A MUST

Intersect XY projection of line with projected cylinder similar to

intersection or two intersections parameterized along line by t and
t  Now look at Z and compute intersections of line with top and

intersection is then the bit of the line from tt INTERSECT t't'

Hi there

I've made a VGA mode h graphics library available via FTP  I originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone
here will find them useful  They are certainly useable as they are but
are missing some higherlevel functionality  They're intended more as an
intro to mode h programming a starting point

 The library assumes a  processor but it is trivial to modify it
 for a   If enough people ask I'll make the mods and repost it as a
 different version

The routines are written in assembly TASM and are callable from C  They
are fairly simple but I've found them to be very fast for my purposes
anyway  Routines are included to enter and exit mode h define a
virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with
no transparent spots put a sprite image with seethru areas copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc  I've also included a
simple C routine to draw a line as well as a C routine to load a 
color GIF image into a buffer  I also wrote a quick'n'dirtytm demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows

The whole package is available on spangcamosunbcca in pubdosvglzip 
It is zipped with pkzip g

It is completely in the public domain as far as I'm concerned  Do with
it whatever you like  However it'd be nice to get credit where it's due
and maybe an email telling me you like it if you don't like it don't bother

Sorry about not mentioning platform my original post was to macprogrammer
and then decided to post here to compgraphics

I'd like the D software to run on primarily Mac in either C Object Pascal
Think or MPW But I'll port to Windows later so a package that runs on
Mac and has a Windows version would be ideal

I'm looking for a package that has low upfront costs and reasonable licensing
costs of course

Wouldn't this require a hypersphere  In space  points over specifies
a sphere as far as I can see  Unless that is you can prove that a point
exists in space that is equidistant from the  points and this may not
necessarily happen

Correct me if I'm wrong which I quite possibly am

It's not a bad question I don't have any refs that list this algorithm
either But thinking about it a bit it shouldn't be too hard

 Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
the circle that they lie on you say you have this algorithm already

 Find the center  of this circle The line passing through this center
perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
the sphere

 Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points This
gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
origin Their interection is the center of the sphere

 the radius is easy to compute it's just the distance from the center to
any of the original points

I'll leave the math to you but this is a workable algorithm 


An alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
center of the sphere Three pairs will form three planes intersecting
at a point This might be easier to implement

 One more time is there any free OCR software out there

 I ask this question periodically and haven't found anything  This is
 the last time  If I don't find anything I'm going to write some
 myself
 
 Post here or email me if you have any leads or suggestions else just
 sit back and wait for me

I'm not sure if this is free or shareware but you can try to look to wsmrsimtelarmymil

Hope this helps

Off the top of my head I might try

Given p p p p

Find  pc center of sphere determined by p  p

pc is the same distance from our four points so
distpcp  distpcp  distpcp  distpcp 

Of course we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots
distsqpcp  distsqpcp  distsqpcp  distsqpcp 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula simplify and the 
xc yc and zc terms cancel out leaving you with three 
linearly independent equations and three unknowns xc yc zc  
Solve using your favorite method  


All the best

 	Ahh no  Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your

  which is k to be exact  xx only takes k but I
 don't think it is a BIOS mode  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do
 that either  If a VGA card has k I bet it can do both x and
 x  That by definition is SVGA though not very high SVGA
 

Yes I did punch in the wrong numbers working too many late nites  I
intended on stating x is  bytes  It's not in the bios just my

Summary some CView problems explained
Keywords Stupid Programming
XNewsreader TIN version  PL

A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView
Since he isn't in the position to post this himself he asked me to post
it for him but to leave his name out So here it comes

CView has quite a number of bugs  The one you mention is perhaps the most
annoying but not the most dangerous  As far as I can determine it has to
do with the temp files that CView creates  CView gives the user no control
over where it places its temp files it just places them in its
current directory  The problem you mention occurs as far as I can tell
when it runs out of disk space for its temp files It seems as if CView
doesn't check properly for this situation  As Cview decodes a jpeg it seems 
to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with  bit colour
information Then for  bit displays it does the dithering again writing
another file with the  bit colour information  While it is writing this
second file it also writes the data to your colour card Then when it does
the last chunk of  bit data it recopies all the data from the  bit file to
your screen again  It does this last recopy operation for its
fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled

 The result of this process is the following
  
      If it runs out of disk space when writing the first  bit file all
        you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of
        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never
        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writesreads aren't performed

      If it has enough room for the  bit data but runs out of room for
        the  bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the
        dithering and writes to the screen card
        However then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data
        from the  bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this
        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which
        there was room on the disk

This is just a guess but probably fairly accurate  At least the general
idea is on track I think although I have probably made errors in details
about file IO etc  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient
disk space  The temp files for large JPEG's x and bigger can be
very large  Meg   Meg   On some of the largest I have needed in excess
of  Meg free disk space


CView has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from
a floppy and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the
floppy then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory and FAT
table I can't remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted
floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly
unrevcoverable way  SO BE CAREFUL  It is incredibly poor programming for a
program to do this  On the other hand when choosing files in the Open Files
menu CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the
hilighter square  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once
when it gets the directory info  And really how much effort does it take to
sort a directory listing


With much thanks to the originator of this article

Hi Everyone 

I am  looking for  some software  called SHADOW as 
far as  I know  its a   simple  raytracer  used in
the  visualization  of  synchrotron   beam  lines
Now we have  an  old  version of the  program here
but unfortunately we don't have any documentation
if anyone knows  where I  can  get  some  docs or
maybe  a  newer  version  of  the program or  even 
another  program that does the same sort of  thing
I would love to hear from you

PS I think SHADOW was written by a F Cerrina

Anyone any ideas

Hi

I'm hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science
project group We are doing computer science honours and our project
is to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'

Basically the program must draw a diagram of a FSA from a textual grammar
showing circles for states and labeled arc's inbetween

The problem is working out the best way to layout the states and draw the
arc's inbetween so that as few arc's as possible cross each other

If anyone has any suggestionsalgorithmsbugfree ready to compile C code  
that might help us it would be much appreciated

Thanks in advance

Hi to all out there  We have this problem and I'm not certain I'm solving it
in the correct way  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this or point
me in the right place to look

We have an Xray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole
passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis

                                                          
                                                         image
                                                          
  Xray source                                          screen
                            metallic  tube              
                                                        
                                                          

We know sourcescreen centre distance radius of the tube radius of the hole

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen  However
the calculations are mathematically highly complex and must assume that the
object's hole projects an image resembling an ellipse if the tube is not
parallel to the screen in the centre of the screen  However it is unlikely
that the object is placed so conveniently  

Firstly we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse  I cannot
know what the angle between the tube and screen is  Do I have to assume that
they are parallel to do the transformation  How do I do this transformation

Secondly there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar
the sourcescreen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the
screen  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion

So please can anyone give us a few pointers here  How do we transform the
image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen and how
do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen

We'd appreciate any help either posted or emailed

Thanks in advance Simon

Wouldn't this require a hypersphere  In space  points over specifies

Correct me if I'm wrong which I quite possibly am

steve

Sorry 

Call the four points A B C and D Any three of them must be
noncollinear otherwise all three could not lie on the surface
of a sphere and all four must not be coplaner otherwise either
they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them

A B and C define a circle The perpendicular bisectors of AB BC
and CA  meet in a point P say which is the centre of this circle
This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere

Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P All points
on this normal are equidistant from A B and C and its circle in
fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere Take the plane
containing this normal and D if D lies on the normal any
plane containing the normal will do this plane is at right angles
to the ABC one

Let E be the point there are normally two of them on the circumference
of the ABC circle which lies in this plane We need a point Q on the
normal such that EQ  DQ But the intersection of the perpendicular
bisector of ED and the normal is such a point and it exists since D is
not in the plane ABC and so ED is not at right angles to the normal


Algorithm

Is the sphere well defined
     Check that A and B are not coincident  failure
     Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it  failure
     Find the plane ABC and check that D does not lie in it  failure
Yes Find its centre
     Find the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC
     Find their point of intersection P
     Find the normal to the plane ABC passing through P line N
     Find the plane containing N and D find the point E on the
	ABC circle in this plane if D lies on N take E as A
     Find the perpendicular bisector of ED line L
     Find the point of intersection of N and L Q
Q is the centre of the desired sphere

Numerically

If ED  EP then Q will be very close to P relative to the radius
of the ABC circle and subject to error It's best to choose D so
that the least of AD BD and CD is larger than for any other choice

We have heard many bad things about the ATI Ultra Plus card mainly having
to do with its buggy Windows drivers

I would like to replace by ATI Graphics Ultra with a truecolour accelerated
card I was about to buy the ATI Ultra Plus EISA but it has had so much
bad press that I am reconsidering


I would like an accelerated card
             a card that does bit true colour at x at least
             a card that does x at  colours or more
             a card that has fast polygon fills
             a card that has fast bit blits
             a card that has a robust windows driver
             a card that has high speed noninterlaced refresh

Any suggestions

My app requires lots of d poly grahics and complexing true colour
imaging  I would sure like a faster solution that what I have now

Thanks

I have the ATI GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO EISA version  I must admit it has 
received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had  Now the 
drivers that are available for the EISA version are the same ones as the ISA 
and Local Bus v Build   Some people complained about problems they 
had with the Build  drivers fortunately I couldn't duplicate them on my 
machine but I did have one problem with Harvard Graphics that nobody else 
seemed to have

I wouldn't recommed the ATI for bit colour at x at this resolution 
the display will be interlaced  But at bit it isn't I thought it was my 
monitor but it isn't its the card that is the only time you will get 
interlaced  If I come up with cards more suited for your needs I'll let 
you know

Hi  I'm writing a program to convert dxf files to a database
format used by a D graphics program I've written  My program stores
the points of a polygon in CCW order  I've used D Concepts a 
little and it seems that the points are stored in the order
they are drawn

Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the 
points are stored in CW or CCW  Its easy enough to convert
but if I don't know which way they are stored I dont know 
which direction the polygon should be visible from

If DXF doesn't handle this can anyone recommend a workaround
The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one
in the DXF file one stored CW and the other CCW  But that
doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed

Thanks in advance for any help

Hello

I happened to spot an excellent book in a bookstore about  days ago
though  It is in C and assembly  It teaches you the assembly
as it goes along so if you're like me and have no assembler experience
don't worry  It has almost everything that I wanted to know and has
WORKING code

Rod Covlin

	I just bought a copy  I can't disagree that it is a very good
book  But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature
described in this book but NOT in xx or xx mode It
is easy to accomodate all the pixel descriptor or color attributes
in those modes into AAFFFFF but not in xxwhich is what
I am interested in  I haven't finish the book but I affraid the
author didn't talk much about this modeor other SVGA modes  If
anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics
manupulationscrolling repainting all other good stuff please
send me mail  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome

	Thanks in advance

We have heard many bad things about the ATI Ultra Plus card mainly having
to do with its buggy Windows drivers

I would like to replace by ATI Graphics Ultra with a truecolour accelerated
card I was about to buy the ATI Ultra Plus EISA but it has had so much
bad press that I am reconsidering


I would like an accelerated card
             a card that does bit true colour at x at least
             a card that does x at  colours or more
             a card that has fast polygon fills
             a card that has fast bit blits
             a card that has a robust windows driver
             a card that has high speed noninterlaced refresh

Any suggestions

My app requires lots of d poly grahics and complexing true colour
imaging  I would sure like a faster solution that what I have now

Thanks

I had enough problems with my ISA bus Ultra Plus that I finally returned it
but many of the people I spoke to through the net were happy with the EISA
version of the Ultra Pro  I kind of suspect the MACH chip was designed
with a bit external bus in mind and the ISA version is kind of a hack but
that's just a guess

Hello
I purchased my new  with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously 
Speedstar  compatible Its name is VGA  TrueColor
It is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE XMODE and
at least one more MODE as well as some drivers for Lotus Windows etc
Only one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode namely
the Windows  driver
Nowhere else except in the ad is any pointer to the TrueColor mode
Some articles in this group about the Speedstar  and some other facts
made me believe that my card is compatible to that one

Does anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted How can I write
a driver which allows me to have  millions of colors with a resolution
of  x  with  Hz interlaced 

Greetings

                        creates artifacts at the borders

   all info what is the trick to do fast image manipulation  I
   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know
   nothing on how it is implemented   Any advice anyone  

 My interest is in xx mode  Should this mode be called

 The bulk of the GW CS monitor complaints to which I can add my complaint

 looking into NECDS and MAG F for my next monitors

Does anyone know when they stopped using those Tatung monitors I
bought my system in Feb ' and it definitely had the Mag monitor 
That one and it's replacement failed within  months I gave up
and went to a CompuAdd store and bought a  monitor there I have
no idea who makes those No problems in about a year so far Knock

So does anyone know who makes the CompuAdd  flat screen monitor

There is a vast literature on Delaunay triangulations literally

	VESA defines a window that is used to access video memory
	This window is anchored at the spot where you want to write
	and then you can write as far as the window takes you usually
	K  Windows have granularities so you can't just anchor 
	them anywhere  Also some implementations allow two windows

 Can you please offer some recommendations

It's really not that hard to do  There are books out there which explain
everything and the basic D functions translation rotation shading and
hidden line removal are pretty easy  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht
he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source
	Also Quickdraw has a lot of D functions built in and Think pascal
can access them and I would expect that THINK C could as well  If you can
find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent
choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the Mac so should be

What are the main advantages of this method  I have seen it described and
the algiorithm seems a  little bit long  I developed my own method which
requires that the points be in a counterclockwise order and returns
whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn
method  It uses few calculations however basically it is several
comparisons  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the
transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the
screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand  My
method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the
screen are clockwise or counterclockwise  When looking at the back of
something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so
merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are
looking at the back or front of a d polygon  Has anyone heard of this
method before  It is so simple I doubt i am the first to think of it

hi all

IN SHORT looking for very fast assembly code for linecircle drawing
	  on SVGA graphics

COMPLETE
	I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular
graphics program to write on PC or clones ballandstick type

Reasons programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose

Platform  class machine
	  x or x VGA graphics
		speed is important color for nonrendering
		 purpose is enough may stay at x for
		 speed reason
         hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA
          cards  My own card is based on Trident c not VESA

What I'm looking for
 fast very fast routines to draw linescirclessimpleshapes
   on abovementioned SVGA resolutions
   Presumably in assembly languagine
	Yes VERY FAST please
 related codes to help rotatingzoominganimating the drawings on screen
   Drawings for beginning would be lines circles mainly think of
   text else later
   you know the way molecular graphics rotates zooms a molecule
 and any other codes preferentially in C that can help the 
   project

Final remarks
nonprofit  expected to become share freeware

	Any help is appreciated
	thanks

 Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an

 precise running on a Centris  at about fps very nicely bit

   Sean I don't want to get into a 'miniwar' by what I am going to say
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris you'll see why please noflames I reserve
those for csma  

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had a
booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one


   They digitized a guy talking there in xxx something  It played back quite
nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to x by
xx  in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasn't fps or about fps anymore  It dropped to like  fps  Then he
increased it just a bit more and it dropped to  fps 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra don't know
what model  to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

   Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a  Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble  And this wasn't even from the hardisk  This was
from memory

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some
hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the 
animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator

   Don't misunderstand me I just want to clarify this

   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not I can
claim x a tad more with overscan being done in  colors in 
my computer not from the hardisk at fps with Scala MM

   But I agree if we consider MPEG stuff I think a multimedia consumer
lowpriced box has a lot of market I just think DO would make it 
no longer CDI

I'm interested in simulating reverse or negative color video
mathematically  What is the transform  Is it a simple
reversal of the hue value in the HSV color space  Is it
a manipulation in the YUV color space  How is it related
to solarization

If you want to see something truly wild turn on the
reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped
and point it at the monitor  This creates a chaotic
dynamical system whose phase space is continuous along
rotation zoom focus etc  Very very surprising and 
lovely  I'd like to write a simulation of this effect
without analog grunge  Thanks for any info you may have

Please email any info to me  I'll post a summary

Thanks

The problem is not precisely defined above but if you need to find
the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon then
you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon  There
are two ways to do this  use a somewhat tricky but bynow well
examined lineartime algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary
or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull
routine and accept On log n  Both methods are discussed in
Preparata and Shamos for example

 Can you please offer some recommendations

It's really not that hard to do  There are books out there which explain
everything and the basic D functions translation rotation shading and
hidden line removal are pretty easy  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht
he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel
I would suggest that you take your code and submit it to
compsysmacbinaries to be distributed including to the ftp sites 
Many folks myself included would enjoy the extra code

	Also Quickdraw has a lot of D functions built in and Think pascal
can access them and I would expect that THINK C could as well  If you can
find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent
choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the Mac so should be
fast

Just to clarify the D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray not the ROM of the mac  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSysD library and it actually did a lot  However it is quite
limited in the sense that it's a lowlevel D library your code still has
to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum  It has nothing
on GL for example where you can handle objects

Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old D GrafSys library

 Unsupported  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future

 Undocumented unless you call header files documentation

If one knows something about graphics you could probably figure it out
but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better
output and is at the same time programmatically nicer ie easier to
program

Just my  tax

PC and Macbased tools multiplatform software


IMDISP

  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites Can do simple display
  enhancing smoothing and so on Works with the FITS and VICARPDS
  data formats of NASA Can read TIFF images if you know their dimensions
  PC and Macs

LabVIEW 

  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  program with graphical elements representing the programming elements
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram program  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering numerical analysis statistics etc  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument VI a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument

  National Instruments markets plugin digital signal processing DSP
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow realtime
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology The
  tools range from lowlevel debugging software to highlevel block
  diagram development software  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NBDSP board and LabVIEW
  Use of the NBDSP Analysis Library FFTs power spectra filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop MPW C
  that execute on the NBDSP board There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of readytouse VIs optimized for the NBDSP

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler an assembler and a linker for lowlevel
  programming of the DSP hardware  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NBDSP board This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code

Ultimage Concept VI

  Concept VI  by GraftekFrance is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments VIs that give LabVIEW  described above users highend
  tools for designing integrating and monitoring imaging control systems
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography
  surveillance machine vision production testing biomedical imaging
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement histogram equalization spatial and
  frequency filtering isolation of features thresholding mathematical
  morphology analysis density measurement object counting sizing and
  characterization

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of  by  a pixel
  depth of   or  bits and one image plane  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT TIFF SATIE and AIPD  Other formats can
  be imported

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations spatial
  linear and nonlinear filters frequency filtering arithmetic and logic
  operations and geometric transformations among others  Morphological
  transformations include erosion dilation opening closing hole
  removal object separation and extraction of skeletons among others
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection measurement and
  morphological distribution  Measures include area perimeter center of
  gravity moment of inertia orientation length of relevant chords and
  shape factors and equivalence  Measures are saved in ASCII format  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules

  A D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale The twentyeight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for masking and averaging
  sections of images noise removal making comparisons etc  There are
   spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity  These include highpass filters for contrast and outlines
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the real  imaginary  components or the phase magnitude
  data  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts

  The transformations include thresholding eroding dilating and even
  hole filling

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include area
  perimeter center of mass object counts and angle between points

IPLab Spectrum

  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  GraftekFranceUs Ultimage Concept VI  Using scripting tools the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention The tool
  supports FFTs  arithmetic operations for pixel alteration and a
  movie command for cycling through windows

Image Analyst

  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of fieldproven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance count objects determine
  density shape size position or movement perform object feature
  extraction and conduct textural analysis automatically  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera or
  a diskstored image

  Within minutes without the need for programming the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semiautomatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size shape and
  position  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices

  There are  types of files the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing measurements and analysis that the user
  defines  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest ROI
  represented by movable sizable boxes atop the image  Inside a ROI the
  program can find the distance between two edges the area of a shape
  the thickness of a wall etc  Image Analyst finds the center edge and
  other positions automatically The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object It also
  supports histograms and a color lookup table CLUT tool

HIPS

Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System

  Michael Landy cowrote and sell a generalpurpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil
  exploration etc  It is called HIPS and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well
  as a huge usercontributed library

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research
  system  development  and  teaching It  handles  sequences  of  images
  movies  in precisely the same manner as single frames

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations filtering convolution Fourier and other transform
  processing edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation digital
  image compression and transmission  methods noise generation and image
  statistics computation Over  such  image transformation programs
  have been developed  As a result almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently Additionally HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day

  HIPS features images that are  selfdocumenting   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  filters''  It comes complete with source  code  online manual
  pages and online documentation

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system  It is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation
  of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax Sun Apollo  Masscomp  NCR Tower Iris IBM AT etc
  For image display and input drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage Ikonas image processors and the Sun Sun Sun  and
  Suni consoles  We also  supply  usercontributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages Sun gfx Sun
  console Matrox VIP ITI IP Lexidata  Macintosh II X
  windowing system and Iris  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max
  Video HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because  of HIPS is machine independent

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an
  interactive  research tool and for more production oriented tasks It
  is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format either reel toreel or
  Sun  cartridge and comes with source code libraries a library of
  convolu tion masks and online documentation and manual pages

  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format Over  functions are handcoded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations  Windows for d image and d imagedata
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse  There are also smooth real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed images all operated by the mouse A wide selection of
  grayscale pseudocolor and random palettes is provided and other 
  palettes can be generated


Supported functions include such niceties as the following

o  image  image     interpolation
o  image  constant

CIA World Map II

  NOTE this database is quite out of date and not topologically structured
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World This M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available together with
  searching and viewing software on a number of CDROMs later this summer 

  Check into HANAUMASTANFORDEDU and UCSDEDU see ftp list above
  The CIA database consists of coastlines rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes Also on hanaumastanfordedu is a x
  array of elevation data containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude
 
  A program for decoding the database mfil can be found on the machine
  piarcumnedu 
  There's another program which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance but you can use regular polylines Ask
  Joe Stewart joeslpiliantcom
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it
  was posted in compsourcesunix To be more exact you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines not the whole package

NCAR data

  NCAR National Center for Atmospheric Research has many types of
  terrain  data ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions to information about soil types vegetation etc
  This data is not free  they charge from  to  or more depending
  on the data volume and media exabyte tape  cartridge track tape

 First check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above

bit scanning

  Get a good bit scanner like Epson's Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News Volume   
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings etc from doll
  house supplies
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area

Books with textures

  Find some housesbooksmagazines that carry photographic material
  Educorp  sells CDROMS with various imagery  also
  a wide variety of stock art is available
  Stock art from bigname stock art houses such as Comstock
  UNIPHOTO and Metro Image Base is available

  In Italy there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work Their address is
	Edition Belvedere Co Ltd
	 Rome Italy
	Piazzale Flaminio 
	Tel   Fax   

Texture Libraries

a Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles a set of x bit
   textures Initial shipments in bit IFF for Amigas soon in bit
   TIFF format Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces SRP is   volume
   each volume   images   disks Demo disks for  are available

   Contact

 Introduction to rendering algorithms


a RayTracing


  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics No Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains For RayTracing I would
  suggest
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing Andrew Glassner ed Academic Press
      ISBN 
  Note that I have not read the book but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book An errata list was posted in compgraphics by Eric Haines
  ericheyecom

There's a more concise reference also

  Roman Kuchkuda  UNC  Chapel Hill An Introduction to Ray Tracing in
  Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD ed RAEEarnshaw
  NATO AS Vol F pp  Printed by SpringerVerlag 

It contains code for a small but fundamentally complete raytracer

b Zbuffer depthbuffer


A good reference is

        Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics David F Rogers
        McGrawHill New York  pages  and 

c Others

 Where can I find the geometric data for the


a Teapot 


Displays on Display column of IEEE CGA Jan ' has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot

IEEE CGA Sep ' in Jim Blinn's column Jim Blinn's Corner describes
an another way to model the teapot Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution around xx triangles meshing per patch
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution

b Space Shuttle 


Tolis Lerios tolisnovastanfordedu has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles Here's a summary From his scispace list

model
A modified version of the newsgroup model model

 vertices  useful ie referred to in the polygon descriptions
 polygons  vertex  vertex  vertex  vertex
Payload doors nonexistent

model
The triangles' model

This model is stored in several files each defining portions of the model

Greg Henderson hendersinfonodeingrcom has a copy  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution

model
The NASA model

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations

x offset y offset z offset

From then on the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

 vertices
 polygons  vertex  vertex  vertex  vertex
  vertex  vertex  vertex  vertex  vertex

Payload doors closed
Units inches

Jon Berndt jonlhjscnasagov seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info unknown

model
The old shuttle model

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

 vertices

Payload doors open
Units meters

We have been using this model at STAR Labs Stanford University for
some years now Contact me tolisnovastanfordedu or my supervisor
Scott Williams scottstarstanfordedu if you want a copy



 Image annotation software


a Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good  It reads in
  rasterfiles but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile

b Idraw part of Stanford's InterViews distribution can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviewsstanfordedu

c Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X bitmap xbm
  and X pixmap xpm formats  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on csuclaedu
  Version  of tgif at patchlevel  plus patch and patch

d Use the editimage facility of KHOROS see below
  This is just one utility in the overall system you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdrawtype graphics using this package

e You might be able to get by with PBMPlus  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image

f 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows It's a PostScriptbased
  graphical editorand it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eosoesthawaiiedu  Requires Sun C  and
  two other locally developed packages the LXT library an Xlibbased
  toolkit and a small C class library All files pubicetarZ
  publxttarZ and publdgoctarZ are available in compressed
  tar format pubicetarZ contains a README that gives installation
  instructions as well as an extensive man page ice
  A staticallylinked compressed executable pubicesunZ for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing

g Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pulldown menu  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats  ImageMagick is available as
  exportlcsmitedu contribImageMagicktarZ or at your nearest
  X archive

WIT

  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVSExploreretc
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system IMHO
  Major elements are

   a visual programming language which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
   a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point filter io transform
  morphological segmentation and measurement operations
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast merge
  synchronization conditional and sequencing control strategies

  WIT delivers an objectoriented distributed visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CADlike workspace by adding their
  own operators C functions objects data structures and servers
  specialized hardware WIT runs on Sun HPxx SGI and supports
  Datacube MV hardware allowing you to run your graphs in realtime

IDLSIPS

  A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS This was
  developed at the University of Colorado Boulder by some people working
  for Alex Goetz  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it  It's a few thousand dollars American I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of besides what TerraMar has
  SIPS was written for AVIRIS imagery  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask  I
  have another piece of software PCW that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification you can compute an image using selected components  I've
  used it on  megabyte AVIRIS images without problems but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card  It will work without it but large
  images take quite a while  times as long to process  That's a
  freebie if you want it

  My  favorite is IDL Interactive Data Language from Research Systems
  Inc  IDL is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier Its
  programming language is very strong and easy  very Pascallike It
  handles the numbercrunching very well also Personally I like doing
  the numbercrunching with IDL on the VAX or Mathematica Igor or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle and the speed and ease of use
  compared to IRAF was incredible By the way it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing This means image enhancement
  cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image
  processing routines Then for example taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse then doing a curve
  fit to that line which I might do like in KaleidaGraph 

 For IDL call Research Systems  for PVWAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado  Boulder  From what I can
 understand you can get packaged programs from Research Systems though

GVLware Distribution
        Bob   An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz   A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol  Motif color editor


The Army High Performance Computing Research Center AHPCRC has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent D and D
data sets  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab GVL we are using
these tools along side standard packages such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit to render D volumes and create digital movies
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called GVLware

GVLware currently consisting of Bob Raz and Icol is now available
via ftp  The most interesting program is probably Bob an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen enabling movies larger than memory to be played  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz  Source and
prebuilt binaries for IRIX  are included

To acquire GVLware anonymous ftp to
        machine  ftparcumnedu
        file     pubgvltarZ

To use GVLware
        mkdir gvl  cd gvl
        zcat gvltarZ  tar xvf 
        more README

Some Bob features
        Motif interface SGI GL rendering
        Renders  cubed data set in  to  seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering in perspective
            only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris
        Data must be a Brick of Bytes on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation subvolumes subsampling stereo

Some Raz features
        Motif interface SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition then streams to screen
            requires an empty disk partition to be set aside
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB HSV and YUV color spaces multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI Sun DEC and Cray systems

 GIS Geographical Information Systems software


GRASS

  Geographic Resource Analysis Support System of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab CERL It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration  You then compile the source code for your machine using
  scripts provided with GRASS  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget GRASS is not very
  userfriendly compared to Macintosh software A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines fft Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp in
  Boulder CO is a primary user of GRASS   This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multispectral  bands  volumetric
  rendering full color on Suns and Stardents It was a really effective
  interface  Vexcel Corp currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps You can call them
  at   or email care of gregvexcelcom 

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run AUX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data GRASS  is publicdomain and can run on a highend PC
  under UNIX It is rasterbased has some imageprocessing capability
  and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment I have used GRASS V on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use It is best of course for data that are well represented
  in raster gridcell form

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration OGI  maintains an ftp server
  mooncecerarmymil 

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grassftpadminmooncecerarmymil

  This location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software as
  well as bug fixes contributed sources documentation and other files
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  tar archiving of files  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial  Because the manual is still in betatest stage
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him commentscorrections The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document so all correspondence about it should be

Microstation Imager

  Intergraph based in Huntsville Alabama sells a wide range of GIS
  softwarehardware Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GISremote sensing flavor

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations flip mirror rotate generalized affine
  Rectification Affine nd rd th and th order models as well as a
  projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion  Principal component analysis
  Classification Kmeans and isodata  Fourier Xforms Forward filtering
  and reverse  Filters High pass low pass edge enhancing median
  generic  Complex HistogramContrast control  Layer Controller manages
  up to  images at a time  user can extract single bands from a  band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application it can handle
  VERY LARGE images and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun
  though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment

PCI

  A company called PCI Inc out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada makes
  an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard
  formats LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget  The software is available in versions for MSDOS Unix
  workstations among them HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly
  other platforms by now  I use the VMS version

  The PCI software consists of several classesgroupspackages of
  utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI
  database disk file  The Tape IO package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape
  formats INTO or write those formats out FROM the PCI database file
  this is the only package I use or know much about  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCIsupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer eg an Epsontype
  dotmatrix graphics printer  You might be more spe cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and
  Fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg
  multiply channel  by  add channel  and store as channel  and
  God only knows what all else  there's a LOT  I don't have and don't
  use these so can't say much about them you only buy the packages your
  particular applicationinterest calls for

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from
  a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default
  directory  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBMPC BASIC but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the PCI
  data structures database file parameter file

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the
  level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well  For instance the Tape IO package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multiband what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different
  interleave orders This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphicarts industry's CTT format would probably I haven't tried
  handle Targa and so on Above all however you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over  It's worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to
  contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of
  other information I observe that a remotesensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude
  longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this
  can go into the PCI database

  I believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  thirdparty display systems the name GouldDeanza seems to come to
  mind  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCTQ Qbus
  bit DirectColor display subsystem  PCI software COULD be overkill
  in your case it seems designed for the very high end
  applicationsusers ie those for whom a MacPC largely doesn't suffice
  although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada a country which
  does a LOT of its landresource management via remote sensing I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas

SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager

  Back in  JPL developed something called SPAM Spectral Analysis
  Manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery byte data   pixels
  across by   lines by   bands a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer which uses much larger images

  Spam does none of these things rectification classification PC and
  IHS transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays
  Actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  stretching  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR an executive based on TAE and may also require a frame
  buffer  I can refer you to people if you're interested  PCW requires X
  for display

 Notes

Excerpted from the FAQ article

Please do not post or mail messages saying I can't FTP could
someone mail this to me  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like send compsourcesunixfbm
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail

Hi Everyone

Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from
 points I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse
from its offset For example given  points on the offset can you find
the original ellipse analytically

I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year
but I failed Under the pressure I had to use other method  nonlinear
programming technique to deal with this problem approximately

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated Please post here let the others
share our interests

I am working on a project where we are going to be including
both still and moving grapics within a database  Of course
JPEG and MPEG come to mind as the formats of choice for the
various files  However from what I read on the Net it seems
as if there are several different forms of each of these

What I want to do is settle on a file format which I can count
on as being a standard format  years from now  I know Apple is going
to support Quicktime on the new Power PC's and so this
may be the format of choice

What format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products  I guess
it is some kind of MPEG for their motion picture Is it any different
than standard MPEG files

Thanx for any info

 Ho boy There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do
 any other graphics in Linux without X windows  I love Linux because it is
 so easy to learn  You want text  Okay   Use Linux You want text AND
 graphics  Use Linux with X windows  Simple  Painless  REQUIRED to have
 X Windows if you want graphics  This includes fancy word processors like
 doc image viewers like xv etc

I need to get the specs or at least a very verbose interpretation of the

I also need the specs in a format usable on a Unix or MSDOS system  I can't

Most info regarding dangers of reading from Floppy disks omitted
unrevcoverable way  SO BE CAREFUL  It is incredibly poor programming for a
program to do this
Nevertheless it is an important bug that needs to be squashed  I am
merely pointing out that it was probably overlooked  While it is serious
one must keep in mind that it will probably affect at most  of the
targeted users of CView

OK I don't use CView anymore but I saw that no one had explaind this
bug in the thread so here goes

It is NOT the fault of CView  It is DOS  If you leave a file open on a
floppy drive then change the disk and do something which updates or closes
that file you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT
from the other disk written to the new disk  This has always been true
and has destroyed data under other programs not just CView

The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave
files open unless it's actively using them ie reading and decoding

Howdy all

	I was wondering if people could email me their opinions on
the various graphics viewers available for MSWindows x  I'm
working on a project to set up our scanner and write documentation on
how to use it and it would be nice to have a snazzy image viewer 
to look at and maybe even edit the image you just scanned

The file formats I'm looking for

GIF
JPEG
TIFF
PCX
whatever other 'major' file formats there are

Thanks a lot for your help

 Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
 earlier post is plain old Quicktime  with the Compact Video codec
 I've seen digitized video some of Apple's early commercials to be
 precise running on a Centris  at about fps very nicely bit
 color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC
 processor should be able to approach fullscreen fullmotion animation
 though as you've implied the processor will be taxed more with highly
 dynamic material
snip
booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one


   They digitized a guy talking there in xxx something  It played back quite
nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to x by
xx  in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasn't fps or about fps anymore  It dropped to like  fps  Then he
increased it just a bit more and it dropped to  fps 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra don't know
what model  to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

   Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a  Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble  And this wasn't even from the hardisk  This was
from memory

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some
hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the 
animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator

   Don't misunderstand me I just want to clarify this



The DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor one or two custom graphics
chips a DSP a doublespeed CDROM and MB of RAMVRAM I'm a little
fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAMVRAM capacity

It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in
Santa Monica CA From DO RJ Mical of AmigaLynx fame and Hal
Josephson sp were there to talk about the machine and their plan We
got to see the unit displaying fullscreen movies using the CompactVideo codec
which was nice very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft
 and a very high frame rate to boot like fps

Note however that the DO's screen resolution is x

CompactVideo is pretty amazing I also wanted to point out that QuickTime
does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated
above I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size
then it would play back fine I have a Q and do this quite a bit The
price of generality personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies
often if ever But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick
on the latest  machines

I'm not sure how a CentrisMHz  stacks up against the  MHz ARM in
the DO box Obviously the ARM is faster but how much

Sorry Bryan this is not quite correct Remember the VGALIB package that comes

So at least it is possible to write a GIF viewer under Linux However I don't
think that there exists a similar SVGA package and viewing GIFs in x is
not very nice

No VGALIB  Amazing  I guess it was lost in all those subdirs 
Thanks for correcting me  It doesn't sound very appealing though only

Tommy Frandsen's VGAlib which is probably what you're talking about
will do the standard VGA modes some tweaked modes and then the Tseng

think I had to change some constants in the dpgview sources to make it
use the ETk modes

VGAlib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA
support each mode is an array of register values and there's a program
that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current

Acorn Replay running on a MHz ARM  processor the ARM  is about  slower
than the ARM  does this in software off a standard CDROM  bit colour at
about the same resolution so what if the computer only has  bit colour
support realtime dithering too The DO is supposed to have a couple of
DSPs  the ARM being used for housekeeping

I'm not sure how a CentrisMHz  stacks up against the  MHz ARM in
the DO box Obviously the ARM is faster but how much

A MHz ARM xx should clock around  ARM MIPS say  flat out Depends
really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARMx or ARMxx
the latter has a cache and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with
slower memory

I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after
graduation

  What is JPEG

JPEG pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard  JPEG is designed for compressing either
fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes
It does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line
drawings

JPEG does not handle blackandwhite bitperpixel images nor does it
handle motion picture compression  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees named JBIG and MPEG
respectively

JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of lightanddark  Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans  If you plan to machineanalyze your images the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are
invisible to the eye

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality  You can make extremely small
files if you don't mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image
archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  Conversely if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression


  Why use JPEG

There are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store
bitperpixel color data instead of bitperpixel data

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images  Being able to compress a
 Mbyte fullcolor file down to  Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time  If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the
size ratio is more like four to one  More details below

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  Even
with a JPEGcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format GIF for instance  Thus using
JPEG is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information  bitspixel
 million colors instead of  or less  or fewer colors  If you have
only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you  Within a couple of years though bit GIF will look as obsolete as
blackandwhite MacPaint format does today  Furthermore for reasons detailed
in section  JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard


  When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF

JPEG is not going to displace GIF entirely for some types of images
GIF is superior in image quality file size or both  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to

As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing fullcolor or
grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and
similar material  JPEG is superior even if you don't have bit display
hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do  See section  for details

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors
such as cartoons and line drawings  In particular large areas of pixels
that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form
In particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they
should be avoided in JPEG files

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels
adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  Again this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files borders overlaid text etc  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high
If you have a GIF with a lot of smallsize overlaid text don't JPEG it

Computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it
The same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such

Plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to JPEG
You need at least about  gray levels before JPEG is useful for grayscale
images  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for grayscale images
of up to  levels while JPEG is not

If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG  You will lose a little image quality if you do
Section  which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only
applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  If you start from
a GIF you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information JPEG
can only make things worse  However the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section  for hints  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not
convert well


  How well does JPEG compress images

Pretty darn well  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy a x fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  The first three
files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section B

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

shipppm	  Original file in PPM format no compression  bits
			 or  bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead
shipppmZ	   PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot you'll note
			 Other textoriented compressors give similar results
shipgif	   Converted to GIF with ppmquant fs   ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info GIF saves  bitspixel not   See sec 

shipjpg	   cjpeg Q     highest useful quality setting
			 This is indistinguishable from the bit original
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q     default setting
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original even with both onscreen at once
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q 
			 This has slight defects if you know what to look
			 for you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q 
			 JPEG's characteristic blockiness becomes apparent
			 at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some
			 Still I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this
shipjpgo	     cjpeg Q  optimize  optimize cuts table overhead
			 Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes  Note that this file is TINY
			 the compression ratio from the original is  

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality the Q  file is every bit as good as the
GIF better if you have a fullcolor display  This seems to be a typical
ratio for realworld scenes


  What are good quality settings for JPEG

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings  Quality  does NOT mean keep  of the
information as some have claimed  The quality scale is purely arbitrary
it's not a percentage of anything

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another but here are some rules of thumb

The default quality setting Q  is very often the best choice  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image  Try Q  first if you see defects then go up  Except for
experimental purposes never go above Q  saying Q  will produce a
file two or three times as large as Q  but of hardly any better quality

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to
go down to Q  without objectionable degradation  On the other hand you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG
The default Q  is about right for compressing bit images but Q  to
 is usually better for converting GIFs see section  for more info

If you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are
prepared to tolerate large defects a Q setting in the range of  to  is
about right  Q  or so may be amusing as op art

Note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section B and to many programs based on it  Other
JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different
quality scale  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale just
highmediumlowstyle choices


  Where can I get JPEG software

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP
If you don't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources
If you don't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the
same article  That article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can
get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with
send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  The Anonymous FTP
List FAQ may also be helpful  it's usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in
the newsanswers archive

NOTE this list changes constantly  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the newsanswers archive


A  If you are looking for canned software viewers etc

The first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one
kind of system  If you don't see what you want for your machine check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet but some commercial programs are listed too

X Windows

John Bradley's free XV version  and up is an excellent viewer for JPEG
GIF and other image formats  It's available for FTP from exportlcsmitedu
or ftpcisupennedu  The file is called 'xvtarZ' where  is the
version number currently  it is located in the 'contrib' directory on
export or the 'pubxv' directory at upenn  XV reduces all images to  bits
internally which means it's not a real good choice if you have a bit
display you'll still get only bit color  Also you shouldn't use XV to
convert fullcolor images to JPEG because they'll get colorquantized first
But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other bit images to JPEG
CAUTION there is a glitch in versions  and earlier be sure to check
the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file or the file will
be blurry

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package
also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribImageMagicktarZ
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  The
ImageMagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped
displays it does better though slower color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software

Both of the above are large complex packages  If you just want a simple
image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release   xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu
file contribxloadimagetarZ  xli is a variant version of xloadimage
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original
The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v
decoder while xloadimage  is using a hackedover v  The next
xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from
exportlcsmitedu file contribxlitarZ  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with bit displays


MSDOS

This covers plain DOS for Windows or OS programs see the next headings

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files
The current version a is available by FTP from suneeuwaterlooca
 file pubjpegviewersdvpegazip  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either  or  machines  The user interface is
not flashy but it's functional

Another freeware JPEGGIFTGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview  The
current version  is available from Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE
below file msdosgraphicshvzip  Hiview requires a  or better CPU
and a VCPIcompatible memory manager QEMM and MAX work Windows and
OS do not  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen  For larger images it scales the image down to fit
on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do
You may or may not prefer this approach but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably  Note installation is a
bit tricky read the directions carefully

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS   This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives  Its user interface is
also much spiffierlooking although personally I find it harder to use 
more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware  For images larger than
screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both
are faster than Hiview  The current version is  available from
Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsdcviewzip
Requires a VESA graphics driver if you don't have one look in vesadrvzip
or vesatsrzip from the same directory  Many recent PCs have a builtin
VESA driver so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing

A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around
the net for a while but I don't know any stable archive location for it
The current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel archives at that time

The wellknown GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW supports JPEG in its latest
revision a  However CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good
it's slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is
poor except on hicolor displays  Too bad  it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW  Shareware   Available from Simtel and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgifcshwazip

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine  If you can't get any
of them to work you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer  If you
have hicolor hardware don't use GIF as the intermediate format try to
find a TARGAcapable viewer instead  VPIC is reputed to do the right
thing with hicolor displays

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel
and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsjpegzip or
jpegzip if you have a  and extended memory  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section B they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats

Handmade Software offers free JPEGGIF conversion tools GIFJPGJPGGIF
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format in
particular you can't get bit color output from a JPEG  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Since HSIformat
files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability  Version
 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  Get it from
Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsgifjpgzip
NOTE do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is
not readable on nonPC platforms

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package Image Alchemy  This will translate JPEG files both JFIF and HSI
formats to and from many other image formats  It can also display images
A demo version of Image Alchemy version  is available from Simtel and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsalchzip

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL The Internet's key archive site for PCrelated programs
is Simtel full name wsmrsimtelarmymil   Simtel
runs a nonUnix system with weird directory names where this document
refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at Simtel that really means
pdmsdosgraphics  If you are not physically on MILnet you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the Simtel archives
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  A popular USA
mirror site is oakoaklandedu  which keeps Simtel files
in eg pubmsdosgraphics  If you have no FTP capability you can
retrieve files from Simtel by email see informational postings in
comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  If you are outside the USA
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel mirror is

Microsoft Windows

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images
Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware
due to Windows' system overhead  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window

The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast  Version 
is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip
Requires Windows  and ormorecolors mode  This is a nofrills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway at least for previewing

JView is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format but it can't create new JPEG
files and it doesn't view GIFs  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it's
an excellent basic viewer  The current version  is available from
ftpcicaindianaedu  file pubpcwindesktopjviewzip
Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites
including wuarchivewustledu

WinJPEG shareware  displays JPEGGIFTargaTIFF and BMP image files
it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter
It has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and
slideshow  The current version is  available from Simtel and mirror
sites see NOTE above file msdoswindowswinjpzip  This is a slow
compatible version if you register you'll get the only version
which is roughly  faster

ColorView is another shareware entry   This was an early and promising
contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG  If you want to try it anyway the
current version is  available from ftpcicaindianaedu file
pubpcwindesktopcviewzip  I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS

DVPEG see DOS heading also works under Windows but only in fullscreen
mode not in a window

OS

The following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu 
Note check pubuploads for more recent versions  the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories
pubosxgraphicsjpegvzip

    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs  Strong bit display support  Shareware 

Macintosh

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation which is part of
the QuickTime system extension so you need to have QuickTime installed
To use QuickTime you need a  or better CPU and you need to be running
System  or later  If you're running System  you must also install
the bit QuickDraw extension this is builtin on System   You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx
As of  this file contains QuickTime  which is better than QT 
in several ways  With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file  However
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format PICTJPEG is
not the same as the Usenetstandard JFIF JPEG format  See section  for
details  If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format

The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format PICTJPEG format or GIF format  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats  The current version  is a big
improvement over prior versions  Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu
 file infomacappjpegviewhqx  Requires System  and
QuickTime  On bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers in fact it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over x pixels on a
typical MB Mac  Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers  You can zoom in on any desired portion though  Some people
like this behavior some don't  Overall JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out

GIFConverter a shareware  image viewerconverter supports JFIF and
PICTJPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats  The latest
version is   Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacartgifgifconverterhqx  Requires System  or later
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEGGIF viewer but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images  Also the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images without QuickTime so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime  But it's faster with QuickTime
Note If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version

JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is
available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconverthqx
This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v a JPEGGIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code  If you are using this
program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and
GIF format and can convert between these formats  You can get PictPixie
from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqtstuffpictpixiehqx
Requires QuickTime  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  Worse PictPixie is an
unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix  There is an old version of PictPixie called
PICTCompressor floating around the net  If you have this you should trash
it as it's even buggier  Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleanedup descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewerconverter
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but
it will run without System  or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on
older systems  It does need bit QuickDraw so really old machines can't
use it  You can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacapppicturedecompresshqx  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it

If your machine is too old to run bit QuickDraw a Mac Plus for instance
GIFConverter is your only choice for singleprogram JPEG viewing  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not
all can deal with the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Adobe Photoshop version
 or later can read and write JFIFformat JPEG files use the JPEG
plugin from the Acquire menu  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it

Amiga

Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amigaphysikunizhch   There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one  In the USA a good
choice is wuarchivewustledu look under mirrorsamigaphysikunizhch

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewerconverter as well as being a
general image manipulation tool  It's cheap shareware  and can read
several formats besides JPEG  The current version is   A demo version
is available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxedithamlabdlha  The demo version will crop images larger
than x but it is otherwise fully functional

Rend shareware  is an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM
and GIF images  The program can be used to create animations even
capturing frames onthefly from rendering packages like Lightwave  The
current version is  available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror
sites file amigaosgfxrendlha  Note although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS  programs the program will also run under
AmigaDOS   or 

Viewtek is a free JPEGILBMGIFANIM viewer  The current version is 
available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxshowViewTeklha

If you're willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend
and Viewtek  These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and
ImageFX an impressive bit image capture conversion editing painting
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products  Art Department Professional ADPro
from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas  ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another
wellregarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites in directory amigagfxconv file
AmigaJPEGVlha  These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPMGIFTarga formats

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quickanddirty JPEG programs many
based on an ancient betatest version of the free IJG JPEG software thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its diskofthemonth without
so much as notifying the authors  Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG
VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of  In my opinion
anything older than IJG version  March  is not worth the disk space
it's stored on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer

Atari ST

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc
from atariarchiveumichedu file atariGraphicsjpegbinzoo
These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPM GIF Targa formats

I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEGcapable viewer for Ataris
but surely there must be one by now  Pointers appreciated

Acorn Archimedes

ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS  version  can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by doubleclicking

Recent versions since  of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG along with about  other image formats  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards the current version is only available by
registering with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink   WJ Enschede
The Netherlands  Price  Dutch guilders about  or  pounds

There's also a commercial product called JPEG which provides JPEG readwrite
functionality and direct JPEG viewing as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs  Contact DT Software FREEPOST
Cambridge UK  Tel  


Portable software for almost any system

If none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in B  You'll also need a viewer program
If your display is  bits or less any GIF viewer will do fine if you have a
display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM bit image files

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings with more popping up every
day  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow  In that case
purchase a hardwareassisted product  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files


B  If you are looking for source code to work with

Free portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group which I lead  A package containing our source code
documentation and some small test files is available from several places
The official archive site for this source code is ftpuunet 
or   Look under directory graphicsjpeg the current release
is jpegsrcvtarZ  This is a compressed TAR file don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with tarZ format you may
prefer ZIP format which you can find at Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE
above file msdosgraphicsjpegsrczip  This file will also be available on
CompuServe in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum GO PICS library  as jpsrczip

  What's all this hoopla about color quantization

Most people don't have fullcolor  bit per pixel display hardware
Typical display hardware stores  or fewer bits per pixel so it can display
 or fewer distinct colors at a time  To display a fullcolor image the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors  This process is called color quantization  This is something
of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  We're stuck with
the standard usage though

Clearly color quantization is a lossy process  It turns out that for most
images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings

Since JPEG is a fullcolor format converting a color JPEG image for display
on bitorless hardware requires color quantization  This is true for
all color JPEGs even if you feed a orlesscolor GIF into JPEG what
comes out of the decompressor is not  colors but thousands of colors
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors  Each original color gets smeared
into a group of nearby colors  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image
source  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output

Incidentally because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences  I occasionally see
posted images described as color JPEG  This tells me that the poster
a hasn't read this FAQ and b probably converted the JPEG from a GIF
JPEGs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG

On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
 or fewer colors  A GIF does have a definite number of colors in its
palette and the format doesn't allow more than  palette entries
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don't have to
This is also the disadvantage of GIF you're stuck with the sender's
quantization  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image
Furthermore if the sender didn't use a highquality color quantization
algorithm you're out of luck

For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware  Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in
this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have  With a GIF you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent

It's also worth mentioning that many GIFviewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines  If you view a color GIF on a color EGA
display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations one to create the GIF one to display it but often it's
also due to sloppiness  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed  Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones

Finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthanbit display
hardware already bit hicolor PC displays true bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes etc  For these people GIF is already
obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively
Thus JPEG is an allaround better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machineindependent fashion


  How does JPEG work

The buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine
transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding  This article's long enough already so I'm not going to say more
than that here  For technical information see the compcompression FAQ
This is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files
pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart  If you need help in
using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article


  What about lossless JPEG

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the
final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  However this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG
algorithm and it offers much less compression  At present very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial

Saying Q  to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step  With the V free JPEG code you can also say
sample x to turn off subsampling  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image

At this minimumloss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed bitperpixel image  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees
bitforbit accuracy

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than  bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
 or more bits per pixel furthermore JPEG is public domain at least with a
Huffman back end while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents


  Why all the argument about file formats

Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms
it does not refer to a specific image file format  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format this leaves us with a problem  In the absence of
official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
do their own thing and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's

The closest thing we have to a defacto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at CCube Microsystems  They have defined
two JPEGbased file formats
   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a lowend format that transports
    pixels and not much else
   TIFFJPEG aka TIFF  an extension of the Aldus TIFF format  TIFF is
    a highend format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEGrelated products it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now the
TIFF  spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details  Even when TIFFJPEG is well
defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common
denominator TIFFJPEG files may never be as transportable

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh  QuickTime uses a JFIFcompatible format wrapped
inside the Macspecific PICT structure  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are
available to do it see Mac portion of section A  If you have an editor
that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand see section  for details

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs GIFJPGJPGGIF and
Image Alchemy  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format  By default though they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI  This format is NOT readable by any nonHSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings  Use the j switch to get JFIF output  This
applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit JFIF
format by default  You still should be careful not to post HSIformat
files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonPC platforms


  How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEGbased format  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file

  A JFIFstandard file will start with the characters hex FF D FF E
    followed by two variable bytes often hex   followed by 'JFIF'

  If you see FF D at the start but not the rest of it you may have a
    raw JPEG file  This is probably decodable asis by JFIF software 
    it's worth a try anyway

  HSI files start with 'hsi'  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they
    won't decompress properly with nonHSI programs

  A Macintosh PICT file if JPEGcompressed will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header scan for 'JFIF'  Strip off
    everything before the FF D and you should be able to read it

  Anything else it's a proprietary format or not JPEG at all  If you are
    lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream look for FF D
    try stripping off everything before that

In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	begin line
	MCX 

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	begin line
	M'I 

If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading nonJFIF files


  What about arithmetic coding

The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output
of compressed data either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed
The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file  On typical images arithmetic coding
produces a file  or  percent smaller than Huffman coding  All the
filesize numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding

Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi
Thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses
from these companies  The fair use doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best

At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles  In particular arithmetic coding should not
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future  Stay tuned for further details


  Does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression

It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could
decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE  In general recompressing an altered
image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an
identical JPEG file  Even this is not true at least not with the current
free JPEG software  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error  If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration
output  It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change
One of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it

In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original
quality setting would introduce no further loss  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation
If you're wondering why it's because the pixelblock boundaries move
If you cropped off only multiples of  pixels you might be safe but
that's a mighty limited capability

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps  Use a lossless format
PPM RLE TIFF etc while working on the image then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away  Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot
of compressiondecompression time this way 


  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG

As stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG  If you can obtain the original
fullcolor data the GIF was made from it's far better to make a JPEG from
that  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to
make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF
that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in
section  in particular cartoontype GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be larger than the GIF  So check the sizes too

Experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under  Kbytes  Also don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from fullcolor originals  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough
JPEG files would be ie shoot for  or rd the size of the GIF file
not th as suggested in earlier comparisons

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor
border around a GIF image  While useless this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files  It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing  If you are on an X Windows
system XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this

cjpeg's default Q setting of  is appropriate for fullcolor input but
for GIF inputs Q settings of  to  often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation  If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher
Q setting may not be necessary

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool
your eye into seeing more than the  colors that GIF can actually store
If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  The
trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like highspatialfrequency
color noise and JPEG can't compress noise very well  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image if you had it
To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image
than you'd get without smoothing

With the V free JPEG software or products based on it a simple smoothing
capability is built in  Try smooth  or so when converting GIFs
Values of  to  seem to work well for highquality GIFs  Heavyhanded
dithering may require larger smoothing factors  If you can see regular
finescale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong
smoothing is definitely called for  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image which you don't want  If you are an image processing
wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package  However cjpeg's builtin smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol

The upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality  smooth  is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs  But if you really care about the
image you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings

	Use the builtin PrintScreen and AltPrintScreen functionality
to paste the screen or window to the clipboard  Then paste the 
clipboard to your application  Cool

Again thanks for the info

over plain telephone lines In addition if there is a REAL Good
GUI lib with D objects and all types of menu classes that can
be use at both end of the transaction Server and Terminal End
I would like to hear about it
 
We recently posted an RFD announcing the OTG Open Telematic Group
that will concern itself with the developement of such application
and that it would incorporate NAPLPS JPEG MPEG Voice IVR FAX
Sprites Animationfli flc etc
At present only DOS and UNIX environment is being worked on and it
our hope that we can generate enough interest where all the major
platform can be accomodated via a plaform independent APITOOLKITSDK
We are of the mind that it is about time that such project and group
be form to deal with these issues
We want to setup a repository where these files may be access such as
Simte and start putting together a OTG FAQ
If you have some or any information that in your opinion would be 
of interest to the OTG community and you like to see included in our
first FAQ please send it email to the address below

                                 Version 

                              by Eddie McCreary

Introduction

The Image Machine is a Windows based image processing package for use with
the CDROMs distributed by the NSSDC containing data from Voyager and other
spacecraft  It it intended mainly for use with these disks and should not
be considered a general imaging application  Future versions will correct
this

Features include

               Read compressed images directly from disk  No preprocessing
                required

               Basic image processing functions such as low and high pass
                filtering zoom rotate flip and much much more

               Complete customizable filter kernels  Write your own
                filters if you don't like those provided with program

               Reseau mark removal  Get rid of unsightly reseau marks
                with the click of a button

               It's Freeware  Give it to your best friend give it to
                your motherinlaw give it to your dog I just don't care

Media

The Image Machine has been tested with the following CDROMs

               Voyagers to the Outer Planets Vol   

               Mission To Mars Viking Orbiter Images of Mars Vol    

               Mars Mosaicked Digital Image Model Vol   

               Mission To Jupiter Galileo Images of Venus Earth  Moon
                Vol   

               Magellan MIDR CDROMs tested with only select images

It should be compatible with most images stored in PDS and VICAR format
but unless the image belongs to one of the above sets it hasn't been
tested

Requirements

               SX processor or above MHz preferred

                MB RAM the more the better

               Microsoft Window 

Availability

The Image Machine can be found on amesarcnasagov under pubSPACESOFTWARE
as imachzip  I've also submitted it to compbinariesmswindows so
if you don't have ftp access wait a few days and it should appear at your
site

I finally got a  bit viewer for my POVRAY generated TGA files

It was written in C by Sean Malloy and he kindly sent me a copy  He
wrote it for the same purpose to view TGA files using his SpeedStar 

It ONLY works with the SpeedStar  and I cannot send copies since it is
not my program  I believe the author may release a version at a future
time when the program is more developed   He may or may not comment on
this as he pleases

Thanks to all who were helpful

I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working
code which I will also include  The intersection of  planes method
looks best but my implementation based on a short article in 
Graphics Gems I doesn't work  I may be misinterpreting of course

I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor
of dot and cross products but the former may actually be better  In either
case a matrix determinant needs to be computed implicitly in the solution
of linear equations

To get the planes I was taking the midpoint of the line from say
P to P and setting the normal as the normalized vector from P to P
These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems  HOwever the resulting
center point is only occasionally equidistant from all  of my test points
for different tests  My matrixvector math is very rusty but it looks like
I need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which
will require bringing in another routine I don't have but should be easy to
find

Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by  sets
of  points and intersecting the normals from there  This would also define
the circle center  However small numerical imprecisions would make the
lines not intersect  Supposedly  planes HAVE to intersect in a unique
point if they are not parallel

Having thought about this why don't you project the  lines onto the d
plane formed by the lines  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in
D where you're guaranteed a unique solution unless they're parallel which
won't happen in this case and then use parametric distance along the lines
from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest  This
bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in d

Hope I haven't put my foot in it again

  Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
  earlier post is plain old Quicktime  with the Compact Video codec
  I've seen digitized video some of Apple's early commercials to be
  precise running on a Centris  at about fps very nicely bit
  color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC
  processor should be able to approach fullscreen fullmotion animation
  though as you've implied the processor will be taxed more with highly
  dynamic material


    Sean I don't want to get into a 'miniwar' by what I am going to say
 but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
 claiming on the Centris you'll see why please noflames I reserve
 those for csma  

    I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had a
 booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
 using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot
 quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
 

That is in fact the current version it only came out in December

    They digitized a guy talking there in xxx something  It played back quite
 nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to x by
 xx  in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
 wasn't fps or about fps anymore  It dropped to like  fps  Then he
 increased it just a bit more and it dropped to  fps

    Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra don't know
 what model  to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
 could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

    Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a  Quadra Mac was having
 a little bit of trouble  And this wasn't even from the hardisk  This was
 from memory

My test movie was created at  resolution it wasn't being scaled up
Scaling was a very CPUintensive operation with the original QuickTime 
the current version has optimizations for ratios like    
but even so I'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as
with playing back an actual  movie I haven't done any numerical
measurements for scaled playback

Boy this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ

Given  points non coplanar how does one find the sphere that is
center and radius exactly fitting those points  I know how to do it
for a circle from  points but do not immediately see a 
straightforward way to do it in D  I have checked some
geometry books Graphics Gems and Farin but am still at a loss
Please have mercy on me and provide the solution  

It's not a bad question I don't have any refs that list this algorithm
either But thinking about it a bit it shouldn't be too hard

 Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
the circle that they lie on you say you have this algorithm already

 Find the center  of this circle The line passing through this center
perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
the sphere

 Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points This
gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
origin Their interection is the center of the sphere

 the radius is easy to compute it's just the distance from the center to
any of the original points

I'll leave the math to you but this is a workable algorithm 

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case
with no solution that worried me

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere 
that they are on the surface of
Similarly  colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the
surface of

These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design
meet these problems neatly

When determining which plane the  points are on if they are colinear
the algorithm should afil or return infinite R
When intersecting the two lines there are  possibilities
they are the same line  the  points were on a planar circle
they are different lines but parallel There is a sphere of in radius

This last case can be achieved with  colinier points and any th point
by taking the th point and pairs of the first  parallel lines will be produced

it can also be achieved by

If all  points are coplanar but are not on one circle 

It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the  points are coplanar
The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar
 points being colinear  coplanar

Testing if the th point is coplanar when the plane of the first  points
has been found is trivial


An alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
center of the sphere Three pairs will form three planes intersecting
at a point This might be easier to implement

 A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView
 Since he isn't in the position to post this himself he asked me to post
 it for him but to leave his name out So here it comes
 
 CView has quite a number of bugs  The one you mention is perhaps the most

A stupid question but what will CView run on and where can I get it I
am still in need of a GIF viewer for Linux Without XWindows
Thanks

Ho boy There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do
any other graphics in Linux without X windows  I love Linux because it is
so easy to learn  You want text  Okay   Use Linux You want text AND
graphics  Use Linux with X windows  Simple  Painless  REQUIRED to have
X Windows if you want graphics  This includes fancy word processors like
doc image viewers like xv etc

Most info regarding dangers of reading from Floppy disks omitted
unrevcoverable way  SO BE CAREFUL  It is incredibly poor programming for a
program to do this  On the other hand when choosing files in the Open Files
menu CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the
hilighter square  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once
when it gets the directory info  And really how much effort does it take to
sort a directory listing

In all fairness how many people do you know personally who read images
from Floppy drives  I haven't tried it with JPEGs but I do realize how
agonizingly slow it is with GIF files  

Nevertheless it is an important bug that needs to be squashed  I am
merely pointing out that it was probably overlooked  While it is serious
one must keep in mind that it will probably affect at most  of the
targeted users of CView

Peter  there's a radiosity package ahead The only problem is there 
are a few miles to sail  

Let's be serious I'm working on a radiosity package written in C
I would like to make it public domain  I'll announce it in cg the minute
I finished it 

That were the good news The bad news It'll take another  months at least 
to finish it 

In the meantime you may have a look at the file
  RadiositycodetarZ
located at
  computeccncsuedu

there are some other locations have a look at archie to get the nearest

Hope that'll help

First off Thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the
 I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for
further enhancements to the Motorola line rather than meted out to
another company Ah well I guess that's what I get when I assume the
computer industry will operate in a logical manner 

In article Aprrchlandibmcom Ricardo Hernandez
Muchado ricardorchlandvnetibmcom writes
   Sean I don't want to get into a 'miniwar' by what I am going to say
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris you'll see why please noflames I reserve
those for csma  

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had
a
booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the
spot
quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one


Version  of Quicktime is as has been stated the current version of
the software The older version is  and  is on the horizon in the
not too distant future

   They digitized a guy talking there in xxx something  It played
back quite
nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to
x by
xx  in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice
that it
wasn't fps or about fps anymore  It dropped to like  fps  Then
he
increased it just a bit more and it dropped to  fps 

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
does playing back resized movies Apparently the process of expanding
each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
bit depth is pretty processorintensive There are optimizers that work
pretty well for showing movies at double size but if you drop to x
size or increase to x size performance suffers dramatically

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra
don't know
what model  to do it and he was telling the guys there that the
Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

He lied  Quicktime is very CPU dependent He was probably confused by
the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode and will play in the
same amount of time on any machine However an LC will drop frames in
order to keep the sound and video synced up

The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar
performance though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture

   Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a  Quadra Mac was
having
a little bit of trouble  And this wasn't even from the hardisk  This
was
from memory

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some
hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the 
animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was   I
was using was  One of the new codecs in v allows video at nearly
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version  could handle
The Centris  I saw was a plainvanilla with the exception of the nice
speakers that were playing the sound and the software was Movie Player
the QT player Apple includes with the software

   Don't misunderstand me I just want to clarify this

No problem  it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the
things it does as well as it can

Subject Removing Distortion From Bitmapped Drawings
MessageID Aprsctccom
Organization SCTC
Date Mon  Apr   GMT

Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a
boat but it could be anything  On the drawing you have a set of
reference points whose true xy positions are known  

Now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using Yaron
Danon's excellent Digitize program  That is you use a program which
converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click
the mouse

Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come
out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways
from the known true values  This is understandable because the
scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are
successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and
contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process
scanner errors and what have you

The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global
adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or
rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory

So the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for
removing such distortion  In particular if I have three sets of
points 

Referencexy the known true values

DistortedReferencexy the same points with known errors

DistortedDataxy other points with unknown errors

what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to
DistortedData to remove the errors

I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted
reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d
surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove
the errors in the other data points

Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas or better yet
pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems

Thanks

Earl

Hello netters

Sorry I don't know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing
probably should be a CFV but since I don't have tha ability to create a 
news group myself I just want to start the discussion 

I enjoy reading cg very much but I often find it difficult to sort out what
I'm interested in Everything from screendrivers graphics cards graphics
programming and graphics programs are discused here What I'd like is a 
compgraphicsprogrammer news group
What do you other think

This sounds wonderful but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing
this or they don't have the power to do so  For example I would like
to see a compgraphics architecture like this

compgraphicsalgorithmsd
compgraphicsalgorithmsd
compgraphicsalgorithmsmisc
compgraphicshardware
compgraphicsmisc
compgraphicssoftwareapps

However that is almost overkill  Something more like this would probably
make EVERYONE a lot happier

compgraphicsprogrammer
compgraphicshardware
compgraphicsapps
compgraphicsmisc

It would be nice to see specialized groups devote to d d morphing
raytracing image processing interactive graphics toolkits languages
object systems etc but these could be posted to a relevant group or
have a mailing list organized

That way when someone reads news they don't have to see these subject
headings which are rather disparate

System specific stuff  should be under compsys or composprogrammer 

	Need help programming GL
	ModeX programming information
	Fast sprites on PC

Hardware technical stuff

	Speed of Weitek P
	Drivers for SpeedStar X

Applications oriented stuff

	VistaPro  help
	How good is dStudio
	Best image processing program for Amiga

Programming oriented stuff

	Fast polygon routine needed
	Good morphing alogirhtm wanted
	Best depth sort for triangles
	Which C library to get

I wish someone with the power would get a CFD and then a CFV going on
this stuffthis newsgroup needs it

 A stupid question but what will CView run on and where can I get it I
 am still in need of a GIF viewer for Linux Without XWindows
 Thanks
  
 
 Ho boy There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do
 any other graphics in Linux without X windows  I love Linux because it is
 so easy to learn  You want text  Okay   Use Linux You want text AND
 graphics  Use Linux with X windows  Simple  Painless  REQUIRED to have
 X Windows if you want graphics  This includes fancy word processors like
 doc image viewers like xv etc

Ummm I beg to differ A kind soul sent me a program called DPGVIEW that
will do exactly what I want view GIF images under Linux without XWindows
And it does support all the way up to x The biggest complaint I
have is it is painfully SLOW It takes about  minute to display an image
I am use to CSHOW under DOS which takes a split second Any idea why it
is so slow under Linux Anybody have anything better Plus anybody have
the docs to DPGView Thanks

I think you are too optimistic PostScript is a very big language and
so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of ANY arbitrary
ps code The only program I know to manipulate PostScript files is
IslandDraw
I for myself use xfig and include the PostScript files converted to

adding text and so on

DETAILED DESCRIPTION


    Artists designers scientists engineers and educators share the
    problem of moving information from one mind to another
    Traditionally they have used pictures words demonstrations
    music and dance to communicate imagery  However expressing
    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well
    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far
    exceed their technical skills

    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression
    tools has compounded this problem  In hypermedia multimedia and
    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the
    observer or participant  Wading through a multitude of
    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar
    representions a confounded user asks What does it all mean

    Since image construction transmission reception decipherment and
    ultimate understanding are complex tasks strongly influenced by
    physiology education and culture and since electronic media
    radically amplify each processing step then we as electronic
    communicators must determine the fundamental paradigms for
    composing imagery for understanding

    Therefore the purpose of this conference is to bring together a
    breadth of disciplines including but not limited to the
    physical biological and computational sciences technology art
    psychology philosophy and education in order to define and
    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the
    computer graphics context

Email me if you want me to dig up their phone  and you can probably get
some promotional lit

I understand there have been a couple of raves in LA billing themselves as
Virtual Reality parties What I hear they do is project GIF images around
on the walls as well as run animations through a Newtek Toaster

Seems like we need to adopt the term Really Virtual Reality or something except
for the nonimmersive stuff which is Virtually Really Virtual Reality

In article Aprsctccom boebertsctccom Earl Boebert writes
Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a
boat but it could be anything  On the drawing you have a set of
reference points whose true xy positions are known  

Now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using Yaron
Danon's excellent Digitize program  That is you use a program which
converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click
the mouse

Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come
out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways
from the known true values  This is understandable because the
scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are
successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and
contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process
scanner errors and what have you

The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global
adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or
rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory

So the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for
removing such distortion  In particular if I have three sets of
points 

Referencexy the known true values

DistortedReferencexy the same points with known errors

DistortedDataxy other points with unknown errors

what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to
DistortedData to remove the errors

I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted
reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d
surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove
the errors in the other data points

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion  or at least
a reasonable model of the class of distortion  Below is a very short
description of the process which we use if you have further questions
feel free to poke me via email


ASSUME locally smooth distortion

 Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your xy points  This
   defines the set of neighbors for each point  If your data are
   not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull
   Consider deleting these edges

 Now there are two goals

    a move the DistortedDataxy to the Referencexy
    b keep the Lengthe as measured from the current xy's
       as close as possible to the DigitizedLengthe as measured 
       using the digitized xy's

 For every point compute a displacement based on a and b  For
   example

    a For xy points for which you know the Referencexy you
       can move alphaReferencexy  Currentxy   This will
       slowly move the DistortedReferencexy towards the
       Referencexy 
    b For all other points examine the current length of each edge
       For each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge
       the correct length where correct is the DigitizedLength 
       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the
       point alphaSumOfEdgeDisplacements  This will keep the
       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh

 Iterate  until you are happy for example no point moves very much

alpha and alpha need to be determined by experimentation   Consider
how much you believe the Referencexy  ie do you absolutely insist
on the final points exactly matching the References or do you want to
balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length
of the edges

WARNING there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be
observed essentially you can't allow the convex hull to change and
you can't allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles  Both of
these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of
individual points or by periodically retriangulating the points using 
the current positions  but still calculating DigitizedLength from the
original positions  When we first did this the triangulation time was
prohibitive so we only did it once  If I were motivated to try and
change code that has been working in production mode for  years I
might go back and retriangulate on every iteration  If you have more
compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having
every point interact with every other pointbut first read up on
linear solutions to the nbody problem

There are lots of papers in the last  years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on
springs constraints  and energy calculations which are relevant  The
above method is described in more or less detail in

	About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to
be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult  I am wondering if
anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published 
solutions to it

	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two
roughly parallel cubic splines  For inputs the problem essentially
starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional ie only extant
between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space  To draw 
the object we 

 fit a cubic spline through the points  Each spline is effectively
	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the
        curve  Each spline has an equal number of segments  We assume
	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not
	exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable
	measure
 Take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment
	of the opposing spline  Use the pair of segments to form two
	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface
 Depth sort the triangles
 Take each triangle in sorted order project onto a D pixmap draw
	and color the triangle  Take the edge of the triangle that is
	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge
	colored with a special edge color

	It is the edge coloring in step  that is at the heart of the
problem  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface
The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in
the edge of the surface  The reasons for this are fairly complicated
They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting
from the projecting the splines  If anything about this problem
sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this
area

Thanks

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in favor of
doing this  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
this group from code to hardware to algorithms  I just think making 
different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts
a week per group  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
for discussing all aspects of graphics  Anyone else feel this way
Just curious

How do you write to the second bankpage of memory when in VGA
xx colour mode ie to perform page flipping animation
and buffering of the screen
     I have tried using the Map Mask Registers but this does not
perform the required task Although it does do something

Note It must be able to work on a standard VGA ie not
necessarily a SVGA card

Many thanx in advance

	Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape
is harder than it looks  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are 
very different than the NTSC format used by televisions  While
there is equipment that will do the conversion it is hard to
get your hands on and costs quite a bit

	If you have access to an Amiga computer that has an
NTSC output you can transfer certain types of graphic files by
modem and tape them from the NTSC output  Unfortunately this
would be framebyframe and would lead to unbelievably scratchy
animation unless you had a good Amiga animation program

	Otherwise see if your local public access cable
station has equipment that you can use

Keywords ellipse


Hi Everyone

Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week I guess
my question was not so clear Now I'd like to describe it in detail

The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which
rolls on the ellipse In other words the distance between the ellipse
and its offset is same everywhere

This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used
The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the
positions of the ball's center Is the offset of an ellipse still
an ellipse The answer is no Ironically DMIS  an American Indutrial
Standard says it is ellipse So almost all the software which was
implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong The software was also sold
internationaly Imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug
How many qualified parts with ellipse werewill be discarded And most
importantly how many defective parts with ellipse arewill be used

I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year
to specially solve this problem I spent two months on analysis of this
problem and six months on programming Now my solution nonlinear
is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire
or half offset It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from
a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not
analytical I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things
complicated Please give me a hint

I know you may argue this is not a CG problem You are right it is not
However so many people involved in the problem sphere from  poits
Why not an ellipse And why not its offset

Please post here and let the others share our interests 
I got several emails from our netters they said they need the
summary of the answers

Well how about those of us who have picture CDROMS and would like to use
CVIEW because it is fast and it works well but can't because the moron lacked
the foresight to create the temp file in the program's path not the current
didrectory


  Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or
TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable  This is pretty much a standard for DOS Windows and OS
applications

	Hi

	I have a problem I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve

	Background of the problem
	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain ie  the mesh is a 
	mapping of a d Bezier patch into d The area in this domain
	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered The trimming
	loop is a set of d Bezier curve segments
	For the sake of notation the mesh is made up of cells

	My problem is this 
	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller
	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments If a cell
	is wholly inside the areathen it is output as a whole 
	else it is trivially rejected 

	Does any body know how thiss can be done or is there any algo 
	somewhere for doing this

	Any help would be appreciated

	Thanks

There was a very useful article in one of the  issues of
Transactions On Graphics I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors Sorry not to be more specific I don't have the
reference here with me

The article actually was more general than this giving a way to decide
whether a given cubic Bezier curve contains cusps intersection points
or whatever wierdness The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH

 Can you please offer some recommendations

I think APDA has something called MacWireFrame which is a full

I think it weighs in at  but I've been wrong on an order
of magnitude before


 I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today The cost is  but there
 are no license royalties His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento CA phone
  He doesn't have email Very nice guy very knowledgeable about
 graphics Seems like he may have a decent package It's an Object Pascal Framework
 that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes 
 I'm going to check it out and see if it's got what I need for my CAD package

 I also found another package D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle
 The number is  also no email The package is strong at ray tracing
 I'm not too sure about its geometry creation tools I also need to look into this
 package some more I also spoke with the author Mark Owens another nice
 guy that seems to know his business The price is  no royalties

It's really not that hard to do  There are books out there which explain
everything and the basic D functions translation rotation shading and
hidden line removal are pretty easy  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht
he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel

 Yes I want to concentrate on other development issues  I've created graphics
 libraries before it's too time consuming life's too short

	Also Quickdraw has a lot of D functions built in and Think pascal
can access them and I would expect that THINK C could as well  If you can
find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent
choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the Mac so should be
fast

Just to clarify the D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray not the ROM of the mac  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSysD library and it actually did a lot  However it is quite
limited in the sense that it's a lowlevel D library your code still has
to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum  It has nothing
on GL for example where you can handle objects

 Thanks for the clarification Before posting my original request I had looked
 into the Mac's D capabilities and dismissed them as low grade

The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon not
necessarily rectangular as a window  My problem then is in
finding out all the new vertices of the resulting subpolygons
from the first one  Is this simply a matter of extending the
usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked
against another polygon  Is there a simpler way

I am trying to convert an mmotion IBM video file format YUV to RGB 
data

THE Y portion is a byte from 
THE V is a byte 
THe color is U and V
and the intensity is Y

DOes anyone have any ideas for algorhtyms or programs 

Can someone tell me where to get info on the U and V of a television signal 

IF you need more info reply at the email address
Basically what I am doing is converting a digital NTSC format to RGB VGA
for displaying captured video pictures

Thanks

G'day all

Can anybody point me at a utility which will readconvertcropwhatnot
display HDF image files  I've had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA 
and it must take an award for odd directory structure strange storage
approaches and minimalist documentation 

Part of the problem is that I want to look at large MB HDF files and
crop out a section Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility from
which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily I can convert the cropped
part into another format for viewinganimation

Otherwise can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation SW
for HDF r or beta and do the above croppingetc This is for
Suns with SunOS 

Any help GREATLY appreciated Ta muchly 

Cheers
	Markus

CALL FOR VOTES creation of compwindowssuit

A Request For Discussion was posted on  Mar  and both charter
and group name have been accepted

Charter


What is SUIT


SUIT provides a standard library of screen components buttons menus
sliders etc and allows interactive layout and specification of user
interfaces  The user interface to a SUIT program is editable even while
the application runs  Programs using SUIT are written in ANSIC  SUIT
runs on UNIXX Color Macintosh DOS and Windows  a single application
source file may be recompiled to run on all platforms

SUIT was designed to be easy to learn  we view it as the Pascal of UI
toolkits  Learning from a page written tutorial our undergraduates
have been able to use SUIT productively after  hours  This is possible
because we rely more heavily on interactive tools than previous toolkits
and because the entire system as been designed to be easy to learn

SUIT's biggest advantages are
	 it runs across a very wide variety of hardware platforms
	 it has a documented  hour learning curve for beginners
	 it's very lightweight relatively small amount of code

SUIT has now been distributed to thousands of sites and has reached
all continents but Antarctica It has also been used in graduate
courses at some universities including Stanford

The suitusers mailing list now has nearly  participants and has
message traffic of  per day Some users have unsubcribed already
citing the volume of mail as the main reason We feel that this
justifies a newsgroup

Details of the newsgroup


compwindowssuit will be an unmoderated forum that will handle all
aspects of SUIT including

	 questions about SUIT
	 bug reports
	 distribution of contributory code
	 announcement of new releases

Voting


Voting will begin when this CFV is posted and will end on May  
at  EST In order for the group to be created there must be a 
majority of yes votes to no votes and there must be  more yes votes
than no votes

To vote yes please send mail to
	suityesuvacscsvirginiaedu

To vote no please send mail to
	suitnouvacscsvirginiaedu

All votes will receive an acknowledgement If there is a problem
please DO NOT send mail to either of these addresses send them to
the one below

The subject field must be unambiguous for example I vote foragainst
compwindowssuit Conditional votes which may receive an acknowledgement
initially will be rejected No anonymous votes will be accepted
If you wish to change your vote mail a new vote only the most recent
vote by a user will be counted

If you have problems questions or comments please mail them to
	suitadminuvacscsvirginiaedu
where we will attempt to respond as quickly as possible

Over this period two additional CFVs will be posted along with
an acknowledgement of valid votes

Thanks

I must agree  There is a dizzying number of csamiga newsgroups
already  In addition there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories

Also it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with megacrossposting thus the groupsplit
would not in all likelihood bring about a more structured
environment

 Why so up tight  FOr that matter TIFF is out now so why not gripe
 about its problems  Also if its so important to you volunteer to
 help define or critique the spec

I've got the  spec obviously since I quoted it in my last posting 
My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly
infinitely easier to write than to read which I think hurts your
acceptance by anything that will need to read those images eg
paint programs

In a nutshell I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is
trimmed significantly and then it wouldn't be TIFF anymore  They
keep trying to cut it back but it's late now  Maybe they will fix it
and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility 
That would probably make me happy

Hi

The RTrace ray tracer supports D text as a primitive not collections of
spheres cylinders and so on
The D chars are made of lines and splines that are extruded

Please have a look at asterixinescnpt  in directory
pubRTrace
In pubRTracetmp there are some demo images with high quality text
All of them are called Textjpg JPEG encoded See them first and then
tell me what you think

 Also it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
 groups is already plagued with megacrossposting thus the groupsplit
 would not in all likelihood bring about a more structured
 environment

Hi
It might be nice to know what's possible on different hard ware platforms
But usually the hard ware is fixed  in my case either Unix or DOS PC 
So I'm not much interested in Amiga news 

In the case of Software I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this
newgroup to run on a Unix platform so I'm not interested in this information

I would suggest to split the group I don't see the problem of crossposting
Then you need to read just  newgroups with half the size 

BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
TRAFFIC A LOT

     If you have the GRASP animation system then yes it's quite easy
You simply use GLIB to extract the image each frame in a GL is
actually a complete PCX or CLP file then use one of MANY available
utilities to convert it  If you don't have the GRASP package I'm afraid
I can't help you  Sorry
     By the way before you ask GRASP GRaphics Animation System for

There are several public domain utilities available at your usual
archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a gl
file check in the 'graphics' directories under grasp  The problem 
is that the clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
the many pd format converters I have used Any hint welcome
Let me know if you have problems locating the utilities
Hope it helps

I'm not sure if you got the information you were looking for so I'll
post it anyway for the general public  To load an image on your root
window add this line to the end of your xsession file

 xloadimage onroot fullscreen giffilename 

This is assuming of course you have the xloadimage client and as
for the switches I think they pretty much explain what is going on
If you leave out the  the terminal locks till you kill it
You already knew that though

Hope this helps

Beware  There is only one such copyrighted image and the company

 No explicit c is necessary  If it the image is attributed to the
Geosphere Company then there is a likelihood permission is has been
given to reprint

 Unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals
However interesting images do make their way into ads and
computer demos That is when a pirate might get some flak
This image is considered so interesting that many people would
like to use it whenever some global map is needed so there
is lots of temptation

 One mail person said since the source data satellite imagery
is not copyrighted then the derived image can't be  Not true
A new distinctive creative expression of the data can be protected
This image is certainly fits such since NO ONE ELSE has taken the
tremendous effort to recreate it themselves  Precedent is a recent
telephone book court case  Ma Bell tried to copyright the data in
their books and prevent competitors from copying it there are
trick entries in the book  But the court only permitted copyright
of the expression of the data and not the data themselves You cant
xerox and sell the telephone book

 There will be more attention to digital copyrights in the future
and computer becomes a mass product and moguls such as Bill Gates
are currently hoarding the digital copyrights

 I'd prefer that Geosphere put this data in the public domain because
it is very interesting to me and others but that's the way things are

 The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon not

 finding out all the new vertices of the resulting subpolygons
 from the first one  Is this simply a matter of extending the

 against another polygon  Is there a simpler way

	It depends on what kind of the polygons

Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film
system based on the Mac Quadra that does nonlinear full digital editing

If you're considering such a system here are the pros and cons

For the educational environment this system is excellent  We use it to
produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local
network  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs the
image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the
video to the Net

We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for
use by the Lewis  Clark community  Since these programs are not meant for
commercial or broadcast use image quality is not critical

The Digital Film system for those of you who are uninitiated is an AB roll
digitizing system on one  JPEG compression card  It was promoted as
an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality  SuperMac the maker
of the card is trying to achieve this quality level but as yet has been
unable to deliver  Our system produces near VHS quality at  fields per
second x overscan  The card repeats every other field to get 
fields per second  This results in a kind of Super  film look that some
find distracting

If you can get past this problem you'll find the Adobe Premier editing 
software quite enjoyable with which to work  It produces thousands of
different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting

Because of its nonlinear nature editing is fast and easy  If you've ever
used or seen used an AVID or Montage system you'll recognize the methodology
and the user interface

The total system with Quadra  Megs of RAM  gig drive  Apple mon
itor Panasonic SVHS  edit deck audio gear cassette CD EQ mixer etc
Composite monitor Digital Film card will set you back about 

For you video cowboys and girls this system will not output at a quality
that will satisfy most of your clients  Even though you can perform more
effects than a toasterhead can imagine an Amiga based offline based system
will look better

We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work  Each for what each does best

Please note the Newsgroups

Recent discussion about XV's problems were held in some newsgroup
Here is some text users of XV might find interesting
I have added more to text to this collection article so read on even
you so my articles a while ago

I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can so fine
program XV is that it is worth of improving
I have also minor ideas for bit XV email me for them

Any misundertanding of mine is understandable

Note that 'xv' saves only bitrasterized images that means that
the saved jpegs are just like jpegtogiftojpeg quality
Also there's three kind of bit quantizers your final image quality
depends on them too
 
This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago
 
IMHO it is design error of 'xv' there should not be such confusing
errors in programs
There's two errors
  xv allows the saving of bitrasterized image as jpeg even the
   original is bit  saving bitrasterized image instead of
   original bit should be a special case
  xv allows saving the bitrasterized image made with any quantizer
    the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the
   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier
   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases
   in saving the image if at all

It is limit of XV but not limit of design
It is error in design
It is error that bitquantizedrasterized images are stored as jpegs
jpeg is not designed to that

As matter of fact I'm sure when XV were designed bit displays were
known It is not bad error to program a program for bit images only
at that time but when bit image formats are included to program the
whole design should be changed to support bit images
That were not done and now we have
 the program violate jpeg design and any bit image format
 the program has human interface errors

Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any bit format without
clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use

Some new items follows

I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with best
option than with default option we have
The reason surely is the quantizer used as best it is surprise
the same than used in ppmquant

If you remember I have tested some quantizers In that test I found
that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv
our default in that order In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly
 it actually gave image with bad artifacts

I don't know is ppmquant improved any but I expect no
So use of XV's best option is not very good idea

I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in
rlequant  I'm sure rlepeople gives permission
Another could be one used in ImageMagick I have not tested it so I
can say nothing about it

clip

clip

Some minor bugs in human interface are

Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer Often it happens
that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong
place It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about
five minutes and then it is gone away immediately
The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete

Also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard
and mouse for XV after the image is completed
Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when
I'm writing something with editor or such Those key pressings
then go to XV and image has gone or something weird

In the color editor when I turn a color meter and release it XV
updates the images It is impossible to change all RGB values first
and then get the updated image It is annoying wait image to be
updated when the setting are not ready yet
I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in favor of
doing this  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
this group from code to hardware to algorithms  I just think making 
different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts
a week per group  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
for discussing all aspects of graphics  Anyone else feel this way
Just curious

Actuallay I don't but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having
one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian
in his reply to my original posting
I would suggest a looser structure more like a compgraphicsprogrammer
compgraphicshwandsw
The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you
say we shouldn't spilt up not to get to few postings every day
I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or 
three I'm interested in

I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one
meeting I agree to some extension I see news as a forum to exchange ideas
help others or to be helped I think this is difficult to achive if there
are so many different things in one meeting

Good evening netters

   available through a large collection of X resources
 Cstom widget for OSFMotif developers
 Builtin interactive GUI for plot customization
 Easilyimplemented callbacks for customized application feedback
 XEG  being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget 
   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar 
   to X programmers
 XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIMX product
   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical
   layout of an application
 
C Exponent Graphics  key facts
 
 Written in C for C application programmersdevelopers  The library
   is  written in C and the programming interface conforms to C
   standards taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C
 Buildin GUI for interactive plot customization  Through mouse 
   interaction the user has complete interactive graph output control
   with over  graphics attributes for plot customization
 Large collection of highlevel application functions for twocall
   graph creation  A wide variety of D and D plot types are available
   with minimal programming effort
 User ability to interrupt and control the X event  By controlling
   the X event loop when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot
   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can 
   control the event loop
 
If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products please

I must agree  There is a dizzying number of csamiga newsgroups
already  In addition there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories

Also it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with megacrossposting thus the groupsplit
would not in all likelihood bring about a more structured
environment

 Let's be serious I'm working on a radiosity package written in C
 I would like to make it public domain  I'll announce it in cg the minute
 I finished it

 That were the good news The bad news It'll take another  months at least
 to finish it


 Are you using the traditional radiosity method progressive refinement or
  something else in your package

 If you need to project patches on the hemicube surfaces what technique are
  you using  Do you have hardware to facilitate the projection



 In the meantime you may have a look at the file
   RadiositycodetarZ
 located at
   computeccncsuedu


  What are the guest username and password for this ftp site



 there are some other locations have a look at archie to get the nearest

 Hope that'll help

I don't want texture mapped cause if I did I'd asked for them   Just
a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons  As for the processor it'd
be for a minimum of a  maybe  if I can't find a good one for s
Ideally I want a polyn function that can clip to a userdefined viewport
and write to an arbitrary location in memory  Of course the chances of
finding something like that are pretty remote so I guess I'd need the source
with it  Oh and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise it'd be too
slow  I've seen some polygon routines in C and they've all been waaay too
slow  Its for a D vector graphics program  I've been hunting high and low
for a polyn function in ASM and I can't find one anywhere that I can use
I've found one or two polyn functions but my ASM is pretty bad so I won't
even try to rewrite them

A fast polygon routine to do WHAT
To draw polygons of course  Its a VGA mode h x game 

Hi I've come across a fast triangle filldraw routine for mode h  By
calling this routine enough times you have a fast polygon drawing routine

I think I ftp'ed from wuarchivewustledupubMSDOSUPLOADSprogramming
I have a copy of it so I reupload it there  The triangletxt file has this

I am working on a program to display d wireframe models with the user
being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters  Also
the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so
that they can move around while the user is exploring the wireframe
world

To do this I am thinking of using the SRGP package described in the
Van Dam Foley and Feiner book but I was wondering if there was
another PD graphics package out there which was faster  I would like
to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides
satisfactory real time performance on a Sun IPX

Ideally I'm looking for a PD graphics package which will allow me to
open a new window under X and allow me to draw lines within the
window  Also it would also need to have some sort of event driven
interaction handling since the user is going to move around the
wireframe models using the keyboard

If you know or wrote such a package I would be grateful if you could
direct me to a ftp site which contains the package

Thank you

 What I am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
 we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
 Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck

It should have been made fairly clear that the most Crimson would
ever get was a   old style MHz CPU upgrade  Certainly this
was mentioned on compsyssgi on more than one occasion as being
likely  If our sales folks were saying otherwise they were either
confused or less than honestethical or somebody further up the
chain inside SGI was misleading them

 I'm also annoyed about being sold several Personal IRISes at a
 previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around
 for a while rather than being flushed

There were  versions     although admittedly the  came
out at the same time as the  over a period of   years  The
chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further  I'd say  years was
a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in this day and
age  Getting the  to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the
hardware and product design groups we would have been out of our
minds to push it further and I know that was made clear almost
from the day the  started shipping  We had one last kicker in
the form of the Elan graphics which made  graphics versions over
its lifespan which I also think is pretty good

 Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to
 keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that I found myself
 pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
 just before the end of the quarter but I'm just a little tired of
 getting boned in the process

Please by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support
or sales on your concerns  There should be no reason for sales folks
to misrepresent future upgrades to customers sure sometimes there
will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available
but that shouldn't last too long and doesn't seem to be what you
are referring to

Yes the sales folks do get bonus's at the end of some all quarters
but that is pretty common industry wide and sometimes that can result
in good deals for customers sometimes it probably pushes folks into
systems that aren't what they need I'm sure but nobody is forcing
you to buy at end of quarter after all

 Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies so we
 aren't entitled to a peek under the covers as the Big Kids NASA
 for instance are  This lab and I suspect that a lot of other labs

They don't get all that long a lead time either although certainly
they get presentations on possible new products and their opinions
may well influence the end product but that also is life in the
industry  We can't design systems that meet just their needs or we
won't sell too many systems after all which is not to say that we
don't have some niche products like Reality Engine

 and organizations doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers
 every year so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis
 The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
 entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  That
 means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I
 have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one
 previous poster's words 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other
 vendor  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years
 And every time I look at it I'm going to think about SGI and how I
 could have better spent my money actually your money since we're
 supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars

But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year
period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year
period  That's a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience
with workstationsmicrocomputers  Supported and parts available
yes but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest

 Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a
 corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts

I missed your first posting but as I say by all means share your
frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might
have an effect not immediate I'm sure but complaints aren't
going to be ignored and may affect future plans if we 
hear similar things from more than one personsite

All of the above is as usual my personal opinion not SGI's

 file check in the 'graphics' directories under grasp  The problem 
 is that the clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
 the many pd format converters I have used Any hint welcome

    The glplzh stuff under gfxshow on the Aminet sites includes a
    utility called pichl that is a filter for HamLab that can handle
    the most commonly used kinds of PIC and CLP files

    The biggest problem is that the CLP files don't usually contain a
    palette so you need to convert a PIC with the right palette
    first which creates a rampicpal file and then convert the
    CLP files

 That were the good news The bad news It'll take another  months at least
 to finish it


 Are you using the traditional radiosity method progressive refinement or
  something else in your package


My package is based on several articles about nonstandard radiosity and
some unpublished methods

The main articles are

  Cohen Chen Wallace Greenberg  
    A Progressive Refinement Approach to fast Radiosity Image Generation

  Silion Puech
    A General TwoPass Method Integrating Specular and Diffuse Reflection

 If you need to project patches on the hemicube surfaces what technique are
  you using  Do you have hardware to facilitate the projection


I do not use hemicubes I have no special hardware SUN SPARCstation



 In the meantime you may have a look at the file
   RadiositycodetarZ
 located at
   computeccncsuedu


  What are the guest username and password for this ftp site


Use anonymous as username and your email address as password



 there are some other locations have a look at archie to get the nearest

Does anyone know of software that will allow
you to convert CorelDraw CDR files
containing bitmaps to SCODAL as this is the
only format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises

Jeff Lyall

I used this combination for a while  A QCRZ recorder
I think  and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in
SCODAL scd format  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main
file menu  This may not be implemented in earlier versions
of course in which case you're on your own

Also I seem to think that the sw for the QCRZ at the time
did strange and very undesirable things if ANY part of the
pic was outside the screen area on Corel  I once spent an
afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow
strayed offscreen causing my whole slide to be blank

The QCRZ also couldn't handle gradfill over gradfill 
so if you use a graduated colour background if you then
gradfill an object on top of this the fill appears on the
final slide as a circle I think and TOTALLY IGNORES the
shape of the object being filled

Of course if the recorder isn't a QCR you can ignore all
this and feel suitably 

Cheers Toby

I am looking for some information of hidden line removal using Roberts
algorithm  Something with code or pseudo code would be especially
helpful

I am required to do this for a class due Monday we have very little
time to implement these changes it is a VERY FAST paced class  The
notes given in class leave a LOT to be desired so I would vastly
appreciate any help

Actually any algorithm would be nice Roberts or no  The main problem
is two objects intersecting in x and y dimensions need to know which
lines to clip off so that one object will appear in front of another

If you can give me an ftp address and filename or even the name of a
good book I'd REALLY appreciate it

Thanks
Brian Raynor

WHAT IS OTIS

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny    
and distribution  Digital immortality

The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around nearforever  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future  Perhaps they'll be put in different
formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapesbut they'll be
thereand someone will dig them up  
 
If that doesn't interest you OTIS also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your worksa virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors  Suddenly life is 
breathed into your workand by merit of it's stimulus it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons
 
Spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts  Keep your own
copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption
that's what they're here for



WHERE             

OTIS currently as of  has two FTP sites  
 
 	 projectsotis the UWI site
		
	sunsiteuncedu pubmultimediapicturesOTIS the SUNsite 
	you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well

Merely anonymous FTP to either site on Internet and change to the
appropriate directory  Don't forget to get busy and use the bin
command to make sure you're in binary

OTIS has also been spreading to some dialup BBS systems around North
Americathe following systems have a substancial supply of
OTIStuff
	Underground Cafe Omaha   lines
	CyberDen SanFran   Usenet Waffleiron


 
HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE
              
What happens isyou draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo get it scanned into an image file then either FTPput
it in the CONTRIBIncoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me
email addresses at eof in email  After the image is received
it will be put into the correct directory  Computer originated works
are also welcome

OTIS' directories house two types of image files GIF and JPG  
GIF and JPG files require oddly enough a GIF or JPG viewer to 
see  These viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large FTP sites around Internet  JPG viewers are a bit
tougher to find  If you can't find one but do have a GIF viewer  
you can obtain a JPGtoGIF conversion program which will change    
JPG files to a standard GIF format 

OTIS also accepts animation files      

When you submit image files please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people
to view  Also include some biographical information on yourself we'll
be having infofiles on each contributing artist and their works  You 
can also just upload a textfile of info about yourself instead of 
emailing

If you have pictures but no scanner there is hope  Merely send
copies to

The OTIS Project
co Ed Stastny
PO BX 
Omaha NE 

I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back  
Also include information on each image preferably a  line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where it's finally put  If you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named include those as well  
 
Conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please
contact me and we'll arrange things

If you want to submit your works by disk peachy  Merely send a 
disk to the above address Omaha and a SASE if you want your disk back
This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP
but do have access to a scanner  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM
compatible format  If possible please submit image files as GIF or
JPG  If you can'twe can convert from most formatswe'd just rather
not have to

At senders request we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they
can stand  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute you can send
a blank disk and an SASE or  for disk postage and packing to 
get a slaboOTIS

As of  we're at about  megabytes of files and growing  
Email me for current archive size and directory



DISTRIBUTION

The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to
another  In fact we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such  If you could please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images  
 
It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images
from OTIS to your local bbs  I just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is

It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as
possible  If you have the time please upload a few to your favorite
BBS systemor even just post this infofile there  It would be
keen of you



USE

If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory
you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or
full address credit  You will either find this in the rm file for    
the image or series of imagesor in the Artists directory under the 
Artists name  If permission isn't explicitly given then you'll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it  If no info is available email
me edcwisunomahaedu and I'll get in contact with the artist for 
you or give you their contact information
 
When you DO use permitted work it's always courteous to let the artist
know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files



NAMING IMAGES

Please keep the names of your files in dos format  That means keep
the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less  The way
I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or
four digit code for the series of images plus the series number
Thus Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like
 
	ldmekgif     OR    ldmekjpg    OR    ldmechgif   ETC

Keeping the names under  characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems  


 

CREATING IMAGE FILES

When creating image files be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture  This gives people a reference in
case they'd like to contact you  You may also want to include a title
address or other information you'd like people to know



HMMM

That's about it for now  More guidelines will be added as needed
Your input is expected

	     electronically  If you don't want your images distributed     
	     allover don't upload them  To leave an image on OTIS is

 a week per group  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum

Keywords HRF

 Our shop uses a package called CADCore  very good  to scan and
subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps The problem is that
once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package a header is added
to the HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter We
would like to be able to ship some of the alreadyaltered raster images for
further use on our workstations So here are my questions

  What is the Hitachi format  I need this format so I can recognize
precisely what to strip out I strongly suspect that it's a compressed
format  if so then t might not be possible for me to strip out the
offending header

  Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF It would be
really nice to find some sort of hrftopbm converter out there 

 I've already searched some of the more wellknown ftp sites which contain
graphics formats documentation with no luck So if you know or knwo
someone who knows  please email Thanks

possible  Eventually this software will have to be moved to Microsoft
Windows  It is my opinion that a good API with hooks to PEX underneath
would prove most portable

Does anyone out there have any experience with Figaro form TGS or

are the rules concerning abutting polygonsAre they the same as the 
joinstyle in the GC 

I've read the X pixelization rule but how does the X server determine the

Can someone point me to a definitive book that discusses these issues

cut across horizontally the screen in the top third and bottom third of the  
screen The bars are about inch wide Other than this the demo the  
animation part seems to be running fine

Second problem I can't find any graphics program that will open and display  
these files I have a couple of image conversion programs none mention scf  
files

The system I am using clone Diamond Speedstar  Sony monitor

Any suggestions

Thank You

I am setting up a videoaid for a computer room for the teacher to share his
display with the class

I have seen people using video projector TV sets and large monitor to do
presentations before I am told that there are three ways to connect video
projector composite YC  RGB

Can anyone explain to me the difference and their likely costs

Please reply to my INETNET Email account as well as posting in bulletin

I also like to know if there are TELNET or KERMIT for windows

Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL
Version  did it quite well apart from a
few hassles with radial fills Version  RevB
is better but if you try to export in SCODAL
with a bitmap image included in the drawing
it will say something like cannot export
SCODAL with bitmap at least it does on my
version
 If anyone out there knows a way around this
I am all ears
 Temporal images make a product called Filmpak
which converts Autocad plots to SCODAL postscript
to SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs 
and I was just wondering if there was anything out
there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad
cheaper

 I have to beg to differ on this point as the batch file I use
 to launch cview cd's to the dir where cview resides and then
 invokes it  every time I crash cview the byte temp file
 is found in the root dir of the drive cview is on

This is what I posted that cview uses the root directory of the drive
cview is on  However since It has so much trouble reading large files

   Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in favor of
   doing this  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
   this group from code to hardware to algorithms  I just think making 
   different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts
   a week per group  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
   for discussing all aspects of graphics  Anyone else feel this way
   Just curious

I disagree  You could learn the same amount by reading all the
split groups and it would make things easier for those of us
who are less omnivorous  There is no waste in creating news
groups  its just a bit of shuffling about  I have no problem
with only a few posts per week per group  I spend too much time
on this as it is

It also includes tons of code for many aspects of Mac programming
including offscreen graphics  It does Zbuffering  bit graphics has a

It is very well written MPW C Think C and HyperCard and the code is

worth it

  I also found a review in AprilMay ' MacTutor

   Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in favor of
   doing this  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
   this group from code to hardware to algorithms  I just think making 
   different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts
   a week per group  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
   for discussing all aspects of graphics  Anyone else feel this way
   Just curious

I disagree  You could learn the same amount by reading all the
split groups and it would make things easier for those of us
who are less omnivorous  There is no waste in creating news
groups  its just a bit of shuffling about  I have no problem
with only a few posts per week per group  I spend too much time
on this as it is


Yes but shouldn't size of newsgroup be an issue  Sorry if this
has been covered before but compgrahpicsanimation get how much 
traffic per day   articles  Maybe  on an extremely heavy day
I've been following this group for about four months now and I don't
recall ever seeing such a flood of posts that a split would be warranted

Just my  cents

RIX's files with the extension  sci and scf are just a RAW file with

The first  bytes is a kind of header with the name RIX among bytes unknown stuff The you have  bytes of palette info  for the colors RGB
and then you have the picture in raw format
If you dont know how to make a viewer of of this description you can get VPIC

Hello

Can anybody help me with the conversion of pic format files
to HPGL files The question is as follows

Is it possible to convert files that have been generated in the
pic preprocessor format into HPGL format suitable for sending
to a plotter The hardware involved is IBM RISC running AIX
 How should this be done and what software is involved
where is it available what does it cost what are the problems

 Does anyone out there have any experience with Figaro form TGS or
 HOOPS from Ithaca Software  I would appreciate any comments

Yes I do  A couple of years ago I did a comparison of the two
products  Some of this may have changed but here goes

As far as a PHIGS implementation Figaro is fine  But its PHIGS
Personally I hate PHIGS because I find it is too low level  I also
dislike structure editing which I find impossible but enough about
PHIGS

I have found HOOPS to be a system that is fullfeatured and easy to
use  They support all of their rendering methods in software when
there is no hardware support their documentation is good and they
are easily portable to other systems

I would be happy to elaborate further if you have more specific
questions

Printer model and specification

Canon CLC  Color Laser Copier
psipu unit postscript intelligent processing unit


Hello

We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copierprinter 
We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network  The 
copierprinter has both a parallel and SCSI interface  I have configured the
printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print 
postscript files to the printer  I can also print rgb files but these are in 
turn converted to postscript by an internal filter  The Canon CLC  is a 
publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts 
are less than acceptable  We create the postscript files with a variaty of 
programs such as showcase xv and tops  When we convert to postscript 
with tops and use the l option to specify the halftone screen density of  
rather than the default  the output is better but still much less that 
acceptable  Note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format
and translating the image into postscript

We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality 
pictures  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the 
SCSI port  To my knowledge this software is  and does not come with a 
warranty  The management here does not want to spend this much money without 
some assurance that the product will work


Here my questions

If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or 
parallel port  What is the quality of the printouts

Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts  What is the
limiting component the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on 
the printer
 
The Big question

Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer



Please email directly to me I don't not read news on a regular basis 
I will post a summary

Thanks in advance

 Why not use the PD C library for readingwriting TIFF files It took me a
 good  minutes to start using them in your own app

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF and it usually works
very well  That's not my point  I'm philosophically opposed to it
because of its complexity

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making
some very bizarre files other programs' inability to load TIFF
images though they'll save them of course and a general
inability to interchange images between different environments
despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF

As the saying goes It's not me I'm worried about it's all the
other  assholes out there  I've had big trouble with misuse and
abuse of TIFF over the years and I chalk it all up to the immense and
unnecessary complexity of the format

In the words of the TIFF  spec Appendix G page G capitalized
emphasis mine

The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed
to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity  It takes a
fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in
this specification PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB
and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be
able to import any TIFF image since there are so many
imagegenerating applications out there now


If a program or worse all applications can't read every TIFF
image that means there are some it won't some that I might have to
deal with  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format  I
don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not
that anyone does of course

Greetings
    I have an Epson HI  pen plotter forsale  It emulates an HP 
or   I'm not sure which  It has an option board on it that does
the emulation  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake I
also have  Pens for it as follows   packs of  Black Oil based 
packs of  RedGreen Blue and Black pens  packs of  Aqueous Black
 packs of  Aqueous RGBlueBlack   pack of  Aqueous Multi color
pens  and  assorted nonpackaged pens mostly colored

    The plotter is used  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for
HP  and HP  and both worked fine  It accepts either A or B
sized paper  x  or x

    I figure that the plotter is worth about  and the pens are worth at
least another  more  One thing is certain you won't need to
purchase any pens for quite a while  All of the packaged pens were
sealed so they are all still fresh  The rest were capped and seem to
function as well

    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in
just them

    I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color

    I'd like  or best offer

There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters

The points xyz on a spherical surface with radius R and center abc can be written as 

   xa  yb  zc  R

This equation can be rewritten into the following form  

   ax  by  cz  R  a  b c  x  y  z

Approximate the left hand part by   Fxyz  px  px  pz  p

For all datapoints ic  determine the  parameters pp which minimise the average error Fxyz  x  y  z

In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters

The best fitting sphere will have 
 center abc  p p p
 radius R  sqrtp  aa  bb  cc

So at last will this solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situations I think

Read Issue  of Wired Magazine  It has a long article on the hype of
DO  I've noticed that every article talks with the designers and how
great it is but never show any pictures of the output or at least
pictures that one can understand

 Are there significant differences between V and V 
 Thank you for helping


No  As I recall the only differences are in the dsset parameters  some
of the defaults have changed slightly  I'll look when I get home and let
you know but there isn't enough to actually warrant upgrading

Well how about those of us who have picture CDROMS and would like to use
CVIEW because it is fast and it works well but can't because the moron lacked
the foresight to create the temp file in the program's path not the current
didrectory


  Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or
 TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable  This is pretty much a standard for DOS Windows and OS
 applications

Unfortunately cview does not pay attention to the temp environment variable

Hi

My name is rahul and I am doing MS at USU Logan
My query is
	I have a HP workstation HP Series  with X running on it
I have a true color  bit color monitor connected to this machine
Normally I have the capability to display  colors from a max of
 million Since the monitor is True Color I can see 
million at a time 
Que do we have a facility in Xcfunction call that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of  colors
Que If not Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls

We are generating ray traced images and  colors are indeed a
painful limit besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification
Please if anyone can help i'd be obliged

Rahul

I have a small program to extract a x image from a vga  color screen
and store that image in a TIFF file  I need to insert the image into a
sales brochure which I then need printed in  color  On a mac I would
use Photoshop to separate the image into  EPS files and then pull it into
quark express then get it printed to film on a lintronix at a service bureau

However I don't have a mac but I do have windows  What would I need to 
do this type of operation in the windows  environment  Are there any
separation programs available on the net  Is there a good page layout program
that I should look into

  Hello I know that this has been discussed before  But at the time
I didn't need to teselate a sphere  So if any kind soul has the code
or the alg that was finally decided upon as the best as I recall it
was a nice iterative subdivision meathod I would be very 
appreciative

If this question is covered elsewhere I apologize but I need information
fast

My department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system
on our network of IBM RS workstations  This is not an area in which I
have any expertise so I wonder if anyone out there can offer advice  We
would like a system based either on VHS or mm video which will allow one 
write video frame by frame on tape for playback in real time  It's for
visualization of physics problems  Can anyone tell me what hardware is
available which would work for our system  Some support software is
obviously needed too but nothing particularly sophisticated since the
software we actually use for the visualization is all already written

Please email with replies as I don't read this group  Many thanks for your
help

 Hello netters
  
 I have a fairly weak question to ask everybody in netland  I've looked though
 the last FAQ for compgraphics but I didn't find my answer  Thus the post
  
 I'll keep it short
  
 QUESTION  How do I display any raster files gif files iff or tiff images
 that I have on my root window or background  I have a sun ipc openwindows
  Sun OS  if that helps any
  
 I've compiled POV for the sun and would like to display some of the work I have
 done as a backgroundtile  Thanks for any help or information that you
 provide  Have a good day

 PS
 Kudo's to the people who provided POV its great
 

Scott
	I'm not so sure if this is helpful but I usually use XV v  I use Sun IPCs and IPXs and it works fine  It can display in a good number of waysroot being one of them  It's also possible to have XV put up a background automatically at login  Hope this helps

First thanks to all who replied to my original question

I've implemented the ideas from the article above and I'm very satisfied
with the results I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine
In some cases generating offset curves loops can occur I now have a
fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop Although
I did not follow the article above strictly The check if the fourth control
point lies in the the loop area which is bounded by two parabolas and
one ellips is too complicated Instead I enlarged the looparea and
surrounded it by for straight lines The check is now simple and fast and
my approximation routine never ever outputs selfintersecting bezier curves
again

Funny thing the InterNet I have no idea what xv might be  except that it
might be something to do with Xwindows on PCs  If you know and have used
it and think that it is good email me ryanphmrldstogovau

DVX is a common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporation's DesqviewX
software

I have not used DVX yet but reading the blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me it
sounds pretty great
	 allows multiple DOS machines  the way that OS does but without
requiring  MB of RAM to get OS going
	 preemptive multitasking
	 network computing  a proper Xwindows clientserver application 
this means that DOS program can be used on other Xwindows computers on your
network and that Xwindows programs can be used on your DVX computer
	 although it is NOT a version of Unix it effectively has many of
Unix's features and mostly you will be able to compile unixtype programs
using the djgpp or gnu c compilers

They advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming
magazines They also have InterNet support online supportqdeckcom

Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator There are a few Unix versions

 Introduction
  This program can let you READ WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats It also let you do some special effectsROTATION DITHERING 
  on image Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts
  Include simple file management system
  Support 'slide show'
  There is NO LIMIT on image size
  Currently this program supports     bits display
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor you must have VESA driver
  If you want to modify video driver please read section 


 Hardware Requirement
  PC  or better MSDOS  or higher
  min amount of ram is M bytesMaybe less memory will also work
  I recommend min M bytes for better performance
  Hard disk for swappingvirtual memory

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP

  Supported Wares

   Up to M of extended memory expanded under VCPI
   Up to M of disk space used for swapping
   SuperVGA color mode up to x
   
   XMS  VDISK memory allocation strategies
   VCPI programs such as QEMM DESQview and MAX

  Unsupported

   DPMI
   Microsoft Windows

  Features  emulator bit unixish environment flat memory
  model SVGA graphics


 Installation
  Video drivers emu and goexe are borrowed from DJGPP
  If you use Western Digital VGA chips read readmewd
  This GOEXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version
   But some people report that this goexe is not compatible with
      other DJGPP programs in their system If you encounter this problem
      DON'T put goexe within search path

   Please read runmebat for how to run this program

  If you choose xxxxxgrn as video driver add 'nc ' to environment
    GO

  For example godriver xxxxxxxxxxxgrn nc 

  If you don't have x add 'emu xxxxxxemu' to environment GO

  For example godriver xxxxxxxxxxxgrd emu xxxxxxemu

   Notes  I only test trgrn etgrn and vesagrn
                 Other drivers are not tested
               I have modified etgrn to support     bits
                 display You don't need to use vesa driver
                 If etgrn doesn't work please try vesagrn
               For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display
                 please use vesagrnexcept et users

 Detail

   Initialization
      Set default display type to highest display type
      Find allowable screen resolutionfor grn video driver only

    When you run this program you will enter 'read' menu Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key except F If you move or copy
      files you will enter 'write' menu the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu but only allow you to change directory
       The header line in 'read' menu includes dxxfxxtxx
         d  display type f number of files t number of tagged files
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is
        The procedure is First check magic number If fail check
        standard extension Still fail report error
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'
        If delay time is  program will wait until you hit a key
          except ESCAPE
        If any error occurs program will make a beep
        ESCAPE to terminate
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type
      pressing ALTX in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting

    Once image file is successfully read you will enter 'screen' menu
      Within this menu F is turn on You can do special effect on image
      pressing RETURN show image
        in graphic mode press RETURN SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode
      pressing TAB change processing target This program allows you to do
        special effects on bit or bit image
      pressing LeftRight arrow change display type     bits
      pressing SPACE save current image to file
        BW Dither save as blackwhite image bit
        Grey Scale save as grey image bits
        Full Color save as color image bits
        True Color save as bit image

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file Some questions are formatdependent Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory please press SPACE after
        pressing SPACE you will enter 'write' menu You can change
        directory to what you want Then

        pressing SPACE this program will prompt you 'original' filename
        pressing RETURN this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      filename under bar


   This program supports     bits display

   This Program is MEMORY GREEDY If you don't have enough memory
     the performance is poor

   If you want to save  bits image 
       try GIF then TIFFLZW then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then 

     If you want to save  bits image lossless
       try TIFFLZW or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       No one is better for true bits image

   I recommend Jpeg for storing  bits images even  bits images

   Not all subroutines are fully tested

   This document is not well written If you have any PROBLEM SUGGESTION

For some reason I never saw the original post on this thread but if you are
looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC you really can't go past
the mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs This code is all pdomain as far as I know
and in the original articles the routines were all presented as dumb vga
routines and then optimised to modeX with some interesting discussion along
the way
If you are interested I could find out more details of the issues in question
I have them at home

Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator There are a few Unix versions

One for Mach NeXT and for Irix SGI There may be others such
as for Sun SparcStation but I don't know for sure

You can include postscript epsi files in xfig encapsulated postscript

to draw over the postscript file

There a eps to epsi converter epsepsi perl program

    I bought the diamond stealth  a few months ago  it seems to be a
great card especially with my multimedia presentations  It runs graphics
and animation as well as some near full motion video very well  The only
thing I can tell that it lacks is speed above  colors  Its qualit in
between  and  million collors un unreal but you definitly
compromise speed  It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes
with some great software but Im not so sure about the excelerator
part  I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster
than that  One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver
from ROM at startup I think because I have never had to load it for
links or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at
startup

   SPHINX   

	Sphinx is a userfriendly stateoftheart image processing
and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance 
computer platforms operating UNIX and the XWindow System

	It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists 
conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote
sensing techniques 

		   Intuitive Graphic Interface

	Sphinx features an interactive interface with popup menus and 
pointandclick dialog boxes which makes image processing and
analysis simple and fast
	This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image 
layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning
to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations

		    Image Format Compatibility

	Using smart readwrite functions Sphinx allows you to easily open
and save image files in a variety of formats using bit integer or real
data values  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats
as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space

		    Image Analysis  Processing

	For image and pixel analysis the Sphinx package includes an
assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and 
mathematical filtering operations such as Fourier transforms convolution 
product or principal component analyses
An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows
the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively
Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig
onometric and transcendental functions

		    Satellite Spectra  Orbit Analysis

	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity
for various meteorological satellites eg GOES METEOSAT NOAA Spot etc
The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and
surface conditions and instrument spectral bands
A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles warping orbit simulation
and D image projection

		    Easy External Program Interfacing

	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally
developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite
observations  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters
to external programs using special interface functions

		    Quick Quality Presentation

	Sphinx rapidly displays manipulates and enhances highresolution
multispectral images and color tables  Using six bit x image
planes and one graphics plane the package conveniently combines color images
graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports
Sphinx's D and D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying
and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images such as 
histograms and radial graphs  The package supplies color and gray scale
output for standard inkjet and laser printers
	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation external 
graphics importing mosaic fitting what else

		    Software Support  Development

	 Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique LOA
 of the Universite de Lille France
The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at
the French national laboratory Centre National de Recherche Scientifique CNRS
and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales CNES
At LOA Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing
research needs and advances in computer technology  The package which features
online help is supported by an Internet address

 sphinxloasilcitilillefr through which questions can be answered and
 version updates provided without delay

		    Performance Tested

 	CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data 
collected during the upcoming ADEOSPOLDER satellite mission  Today
the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA  Goddard Space Flight Center
and is widely used in many French laboratories including
the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement Ecole Normale Superieure 
Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale  Laboratoire 
de Meteorologie Dynamique


   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasilcitilillefr
    anonymous bin  cd SPHINX  get ALLSPHINXtarZ

   IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE HOWEVER THE
   VISUALISATION AND GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS ARE AVAILABLE THIS IS
   SUFFICIENT TO WORK WITH

   IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KEEPING SPHINX SEND US YOUR EMAIL
   AND YOU WILL RECEIVE NEWS ABOUT THE PACKAGE EVOLUTION

   THE SOFTWARE IS CHANGING WITH USER SUGGESTIONS WE WILL
   APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS

I don't know about thatI've used Photoshop  on both a dx and a Quadra
I'd say they are roughly equal  If anything the  was faster

Both systems were running in  bit color and had the same amount of RAM  megs

I went back and looked at the review again  They claim there were
significant differences in manipulating a  meg test file but with
smaller files the two platforms were the about the same  David

Hi there

I am very interested in Rayshade  I have managed to make a chessboard
for Rayshade Unfortunately I still have to do the knight horse Any ideas
I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces The board is marble
Unfortunately black won't work very well for the one side Anybody with ideas
for nice surfaces

I would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield
command Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this and I don't have
Craig Kolb's email address Anybody with ideas because this is essential
for my next venture into raytracing

Where should I post the finished chessboard

Is there anybody else using rayshade on nonUnix systems

How fast does Unix render

Thanks

Rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics but have no
artistic talent

 Hi netters

 	I am currently doing some investigations on Developable Surface
 Can anyone familiar with this topic give me some information or sources
 which can allow me to find some infomation of developable surface
 	Thanks for your help

 Abel
 hhkuxahkuhk

A developable surface is st you can lay it or roll it flat on the
plane it may require you to give it a cut though

Eg a cylinder a cone a plane of course or any surface or patch
having vanishing Gaussian intrinsic curvature ie with singular
Hessian the matrix of nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch
are developable In more technical words a developable surface is
locally isometric to a plane at all points


Think also of the sphere or the earth which in a nondevelopable
whatever ways you cut it you will not be able to lay flat any pieces
of it its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing

For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry
which treats surfaces D manifolds eg M do Carmo's book

The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move
around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision 

Since your viewpoint is always the same the routines can be hardcoded
for a particular vantage  In my case wall two's rising edge has a slope
of  I'm also using Mode X x

I've run into two problems I'm sure that other readers have tried this
before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions

 The routines for drawing walls    were trivial but when I ran a
packedplanar image through them I was dismayed by the jaggies  I'm
now considered some antialiasing routines speed is not really necessary
Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed
thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden

 Wall  presents a problem the algorithm I used tends to overly distort
the original  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and failed
Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared
shape

Currently I take

                         
                
                
                

and produce
            
                   
               
                
                           
                                   
                                       

Line  follows the slope  Line  is directly under line 
Line  moves up a line and left  pixels  Line  is under line 
This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels  But
it causes distortions  Has anyone come up with a better way
Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap
already skewed

Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective
I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using zbuffering
Locations are stored in xyz form

 For those of you who noticed the top lines of wall  and wall 
are parallel with its bottom lines  This is why there appears to
be an optical illusion ie it appears to be either the inside or outside
of a cube depending on your mood  There are no vanishing points
This simplifies the drawing code for objects which don't have to
change size as they move about in the room  I've decided that this
approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough
distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in
a real perspective drawing

Hopefully the context of the picture ie chairs on the floor torches
hanging on the walls will dispell any visual ambiguity

Thanks in advance for any help

  Hello I know that this has been discussed before  But at the time
I didn't need to teselate a sphere  So if any kind soul has the code
or the alg that was finally decided upon as the best as I recall it
was a nice iterative subdivision meathod I would be very 
appreciative

Here is one by Andrew Graphics Gems Glassner that I got from a

 	I have seen several raytraced scenes from MTV or was it 
 RayShade with stroked fonts appearing as objects in the image
 The fontschars had color depth and even textures associated with
 them  Now I was wondering is it possible to do the same in POV
 

Hi Noel

I've made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type  fonts
triangulates them bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic
d object which could be used with PoV fi

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which
triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape Delaunay seems to be limited
to convex hulls Constrained delaunay may be okay but I have no code
example of how to do it

Another way to do the bartman may be

 TGAPOV
 A selfmade variation of this using heightfields

  Create a bw picture BIG of the text you need fi using a PostScript
  previewer Then use this as a heightfield If it is white on black
  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts it's still open
  on the backside To close it mirror it and compound it with the original

Example

object 
   union 
      heightfield  gif abpgif 
      heightfield  gif abpgif scale   
   
   texture 
      Glass
   
   translate         center
   rotate                 rotate upwards
   scale                 scale bigger and thicker
   translate                final placement



abpgif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ABP black on white in

   Anyway still with Mhz you need sprites for a lot of tricks for

Speaking of Psygnosis they have licensed games to Philips Interative

The following was recently posted in a message in the CDI section of
the Multimedia Forum

Seventh Guest has been licensed by Virgin Games to Philips Interactive
Media International for worldwide CDI rights Were also licensed to
PIMI Litil Divil from Gremlin Graphics UK and Microcosm from
Psygnosis UK Those three titles will be adapted on CDI using the full
potential of the FMV cartridge meaning using the additional memory as
well as the motion video capabilities Those titles have been negociated
in Europe but will be available worldwide

Also Lemmings    have been licensed from Psygnosis as well as Striker
Soccer from Rage UK

I don't know when these titles will be available or when work on them even
started so don't expect your CDI retailer to have them yet

There was also some mention of future Nintendo CDI games in an issue of the

 The demo was VGA resolution  colors but I don't know the spatial

According to my ColoRIX manual SCF files are xx

 First problem When I try to run the demo the screen has two black bars that  
 cut across horizontally the screen in the top third and bottom third of the  
 screen The bars are about inch wide Other than this the demo the  
 animation part seems to be running fine
 
 Second problem I can't find any graphics program that will open and display  
 these files I have a couple of image conversion programs none mention scf

You may try VPIC I think it handles the  color RIX files OK

At the moment i'm trying to grab a portion of a Starbase screen and store it
in an area of memory The data needs to be in a bit format which
shouldn't be a problem as the app is running on a  bit screen though
i'm not too fussy about the exact format

I actually intend to write the data out as a TIFF but that bits not the
problem

Does anyone out there know how to grab a portion of the screen The
blockread call seems to grab the screen but not in  bit colour
whatever the screenwindow type i get  byte per pixel 

thanks in advance

Martin

I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature
This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line
looks better on low resolution devices

The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent  They
also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in PostScript
environments where it is absent

The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints
of a line using the following formula for each coordinate

	newcoord  round oldcoord    
	
Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in   From
reading I thought that what they might actually do is

	newcoord  trunc oldcoord      
	
This results in all the coordinates ending in either  or  
whichever is closer

By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript I find that
neither of these is what DPS really uses  Since I like how the DPS
result looks better than how my stuff looks I'd like to know if
anyone who knows how DPS does it is willingable to tell me

Thanks

The problem with crossposting is on the first poster I am aware that this
posting is a crossposting too but what else should one do You never know

To split up newsgroups brings even more crossposting

       The function of VS controller is to load TVimages into  PCAT
       VS controller allows one to load a fragment of the TVframe from
       a field of x pixels
       The clock rate is  MHz when loading an image with  pixel in
       the line and  MHz when loading a  pixels image This
       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal
       and vertical directions
       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 
       Video signal capture time  s

                     CONTROLLER VS

       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM
       PC AT or any other machine of that type The controller was
       created on the base of modern elements including user
       programmable gate arrays
       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different
       resolutions Its flexible architecture makes possible to change
       technical parameters Instead of TV signal one can process any
       other analog signal including signals from slowspeed scanning
       devices
       The controller has the following technical characteristics
        memory volume  from  K to  Mb 
        resolution when working with standard video signal  from x
       to x pixels

Does anyone know how the VGA video feature connector operates I
would like to know which of the pins are inputs which are outputs
and which are bidirectional if any  and how the direction is

I have found a pinout for the connector

And I assume that pins    are outputs and   
are inputs Is this correct

The reason is this  I have a Rombo Media Pro video
digitising card It chroma keys its output into the vga
monitor signal However although it is supposed to work
with an ET with Hicolour RAMDAC the colours on screen
behave as if the top  bits of colour information are missing
and red green blue signals are swapped around
Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficient
buffering on the feature connector outputs and is happy to
sell me a buffer device for  pounds
I would rather save about  pounds and build my own I assume
it would require for example a F buffer IC or two

Can anyone help Any information on the feature connector would
be highly appreciated

Please could you reply by email

Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL
 but if you try to export in SCODAL with a bitmap
it will say something like cannot export
If anyone out there knows a way around this
I am all ears

I think one not ideal solution is to use the
tracing utility can't remember the name sorry
included in the Corel Draw sw pack  It can convert
bitmaps to Corel art format  These can then be
imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap
Result  the file is completely in Corel format and
can be SCODAL'ed no problem

BUT the slight problem with this which makes the
solution less than idea is that the trace utility
spits out many more points than are necessary to
define the shapes being traced  Straight lines and
curves are both traced as many short segments

So the SCODAL taking much longer to
image

The obvious solution is timeconsuming  stripping
out the extra points by hand using Corel

OUCH
I've done it a few times 

I was just wondering if there was anything out there
that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad cheaper

As I say if you don't mind the problems go via the route
BITMAP  COREL VIA TRACE 
HAND TRIMMING USING COREL

I can't fiqure this out  I have properly compiled pov on a unix machine
running SunOS   The problem is that when I run the sample pov files and
use the EXACT same parameters when compiling different tga outputs  Some
of the tga's are okay and other's are unrecognizable by any software

	I was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a
bit graphics computerimage processing system  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or
something akin to that  Anyway he claimed it had bit color  a bit alpha channel  That's
 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  Specifically the bit color  That's 
trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  Is this an antialiasing thing  Or
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor

	Also to settle a bet with my roommate what are SGI's flagship products  I know of
Iris Indigo and Crimson but what are the other ones and which is their topoftheline
sadly I have access to none of them  Just a DEC   Sigh

Subject Advice sought Turning font outlines into renderable polygons
MessageID Aprjarviscsritorontoedu
Organization CSRI University of Toronto

Date  Apr   GMT

I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type  or
TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted
by a D scanline renderer 

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but
have never had the need to implement such a system Well I now have the
opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have
some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end

The main problem I face is how to use the evenodd or nonwinding rules to
turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle
complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple
polygons For example in the letter O there are two outlines

	 The outside outline which is clockwise TrueType font
	 The inside outline which is counterclockwise

One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply 
connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the
two outlines are closest This is equivalent to descibing a polygon with
holes The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior
polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges

I do not want to use this simplistic system since

	 It will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple
		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for
		some fancy fonts
	 It does not properly handle the evenodd or nonwinding rules

From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid
decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as
is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers These trapezoidal
polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the D scanline renderer

My question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into
polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer I am not fond of this solution
since it creates excess number of polygons

Another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create
bevelled andor offset curves for font outlines I have a dozen papers on these
subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement

Thanks for any pointers

Hi all
I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color
Graphical BBS that supports PC Mac Linux and Amiga callers 
Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard a summary of 
which hit this group about  weeks ago 
Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find
that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being
PP which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full
commercial software if they want to try out the BBS I know I wouldn't

Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC Mac Amiga I know there
is an old version of a Mac port on bellcorecom that doesn't work under System 
But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it

Is there a color version of MGR for Linux 
I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it

Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga 
I can't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing

Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS 

Thanks in advan

Hi 

If you want to have SoftScrolling on your VGA you have to change some

so I would suggest you take a look at The Programming of the 
EGAVGAAdapter by AddisonWesley You will find all useful descriptions 
for every available VGARegister

Could someone explain the difference between Tom Gaskins' two books

  o  PEXLIB Programming Manual
  o  PHIGS Programming Manual

Why would I want to buy one book vs the other book  I have an 
running SCO UNIX XR on my desktop a SUN IV in my lab and 
access to a variety of other systems Alliant FX Cray YMP on
the network  Mostly we would like to do D modelingvisualization
of rat rabbit monkey and human brain structure

Rather than decide which book you want to buy you need to decide which
programming interface you want to use then buy the appropriate book

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences
between PHIGS and PEXlib it will appear in Issue  which should be out
pretty soon  But here's a brief summary

PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many
devices  Most implementations support the X Window System and take
advantage of a D extension to X called PEX  PEXlib is a slightly
lower level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX
extension to X

Some advantages of using PEXlib
 Integrates with XlibXtMotifetc better than PHIGS
 Provides immediate mode capabilities
 Is free of policy
 PEX supports PHIGS but is currently being extended to support
  features not found in PHIGS like texture mapping antialiasing
  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features

Some advantages of using PHIGS
 Support for multiple devices not just X based ones
 Support for archiving metafiles hardcopy output
 PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier
 PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you
 PHIGS can help you with colormap selectioncreation

If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like
archiving I would go with PEXlib  Either way you will find that
both API's have a lot in common

A shareware graphics program called Pman has a filter that makes a picture
look like a hand drawing  This picture could probably be converted into
vector format much easier because it is all lines With Corel Trace etc

Hello
    I've recently had Povray draw about  sample files The problem is that
I accidently erased the command in my povraydef that made the image a targas
file So now the files are the dump format How do I fix these files with out
having to retrace them By fix I mean turn them into targas Thanks in
advance

OK with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime
the effects of scaling and so on I thought I'd do some more tests

First of all I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic The movie I had been using only had  frames in it it was a
version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor
I decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results
for better or for worse

I pulled out a copy of  A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV
a while back About fifteen minutes into the movie there's a sequence where
the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station Specifically I digitized
a portion of about  seconds' duration zooming in on the rotating space
station I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames To increase the differences between frames I digitized it at only
 frames per second to give a total of  frames

I captured the raw footage at a resolution of  pixels with the Spigot
card in my Centris  quartersize resolution from a PAL source I then
imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor
keeping the  fps frame rate I created two versions of the movie one scaled
to  resolution the other at  resolution I used the default
 quality setting in Premiere  and specified a key frame every ten
frames

I then ran the  movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used
for the results I'd been reporting earlier

Result a playback rate of over  frames per second

That's right I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie Just for fun I copied the  movie to my external hard
disk a Quantum LPS and ran it from there This time the playback rate
was only about  frames per second Obviously the MB internal hard disk
also a Quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback

I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors and tried playing back the  movie scaled to 
size This time the playback speed was over  fps Clearly the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime  in
action not  I'd try my tests with QuickTime  but I don't think it's
entirely compatible with my Centris and System 

Unscaled the playback rate for the  movie was over  fps

The other thing I tried was saving versions of the  movie with
preferred playback rates greater than  and seeing how well they played
from within MoviePlayer ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback
A preferred rate of    fps didn't work too well the playback was
very jerky Compare this with the raw speed test which achieved  fps with
ease I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
much overhead I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
switching

A preferred rate of    fps seemed to work fine I couldn't see
any evidence of stutter At    fps I think I could see slight
stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell

I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames to make the stutter more noticeable Of course this will also
improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance
even more

They are D object files for CAD D  a program written by Tom Hudson
for the Atari ST computers  Don't know much more about them except that
they are stored with the points first then the surfaces are next and are
made by listing  point numbers that make up the triangle surface Then
there's a header that describes coloring lighting etc  Don't know much

	I was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a
bit graphics computerimage processing system  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or
something akin to that  Anyway he claimed it had bit color  a bit alpha channel  That's
 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  Specifically the bit color  That's 
trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  Is this an antialiasing thing  Or
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor

Hmm  bit aye
Well it beats a bit design for thee sake of ellegance
 bit means  bits per primary colour
The  nr of colours is a bit misleading It makes more sense to see it
as  possible shades of pure red
This might actually make some sense since  shades of red  bit colours 
may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity
Then again a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way 
of doing colour graphics because it leaves ya such a tidy and fast program
code

Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years It does a much better
job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
programs Of course a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
accurate trace The problem that I've run into though is that when it
creates a detailed trace it produces WAY more points than are necessary
If I trace something manually I use many less es points The problem
with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down especially
printing

 Since there's no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector
 conversion program this tracing technique is about it  Simple stuff
 like bw logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff goes
 haywire

	The first and only thing I've ever tried to autotrace was a piece
of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator   I wanted to get the
outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound  I was simultaneously
suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did  I
suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing not only is the coastline
very irregular but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines
not only lattitude and longitude but loran grids as well  The most
common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and
tangent to a grid line it would take off following the gridline instead of
the coast  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive
algorithm that would let you step in and say no dummy you're going the
wrong way

	Steve Reisberg a friend of mine a few years back did his
doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage virii
A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized
micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles
This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with
its autotrace tool

	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder since he
was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a
good centerline was only the first step but a step on which all future
analysis depended  However in other respects it was an easier problem
since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the
virus particles were supposed to look like and the analysis could be
restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight
clean and well imaged you don't always have that freedom autotracing real
life images  In any case it gave me some insight into just how difficult
this problem is to solve in the general case

	 Steve is no longer with us  He and his wife disappeared while
on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated  Their last
known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area  While no
bodies were ever found they are presumed to have been the victim of some
sort of fall or accident in the woods

Read Issue  of Wired Magazine  It has a long article on the hype of
DO  I've noticed that every article talks with the designers and how
great it is but never show any pictures of the output or at least
pictures that one can understand

Gamepro magazine published pictures a few months ago and Computer Chronicles
a program that is syndicated to public tv stations around the nation spent
several minutes on it when it was shown at CES  It was very impressive what
it can do in real time

John Munsch

The April  edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on DO which
includes pictures of the unit a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors  bit bus a bit RISC processor
with math coprocessor Video Decomp module a control port an expansion
port where DO hangs its doublefast CD player Mb DRAM an optional
video port for editing video and on the outbound side MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain 

They promise Red Book CDquality audio full  fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here The article written by Philip De Lancie does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread  I come from the PC
TCPIP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen 

Hope this helps

Has anyone seen hallusions  You can buy a poster of them and it looks like a simple dot pattern
when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a d picture  I'm looking for
a program that generates these pictures  There's a company in Texas that makes them but I

Does anyone have any real experience with the Kubota KenaiDenali
series of graphics workstations  They pretty much blow the pants
off SGI machines and Sun machines in the same price point which
is about  bucks  Real nice stuff but I've only seen the
stuff on paper  I'm wondering is there anything NOT to like  The
specs are too massive to get into here but if a summary is desired
I could be coaxed into uploading the spec sheet

fast routines than just polygons  It would be nice to know exaclty what
system VGA is a start but what processor and a few of the specifics of the

I don't want texture mapped cause if I did I'd asked for them   Just
a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons  As for the processor it'd
be for a minimum of a  maybe  if I can't find a good one for s
Ideally I want a polyn function that can clip to a userdefined viewport

Ok It is for a game that is d and you have listed the characteristics 
that you are looking for I think you may have left out a few 
important parameters 
The polygons are all convex 
They have less than N sides you are drawing meshes walls doors etc

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave  self intersecting polygons 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line
Complex figure  type polygons can be a bit trickier

The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 
number like  or  allow othe optimisations to be made

Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons  

finding something like that are pretty remote so I guess I'd need the source
with it  Oh and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise it'd be too
slow  I've seen some polygon routines in C and they've all been waaay too
slow  Its for a D vector graphics program  I've been hunting high and low

It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms
If you limit yourself to  or four sided simple convex polygons
I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a 
asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be


for a polyn function in ASM and I can't find one anywhere that I can use
I've found one or two polyn functions but my ASM is pretty bad so I won't
even try to rewrite them

a good start  Chapter  is Viewing in D then read chapter

 Quantizing  bit images down to  bits

Find a copy of Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display by
Paul Heckbert SIGGRAPH ' Proceedings page   There are other
algorithms but this one works well and is fairly simple  Implementations
are included in most raster toolkits see item  below

A variant method is described in Graphics Gems p   Note that
the code from the Graphics Gems series is all available from an FTP site
as described above

Check out John Bradley's Diversity Algorithm which is incorporated into
the xv package and described in the back of the manual

The ImageMagick package see section  for where it is contains another
quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the
other algorithms but slower

There's also an implementation of

Wan Wong and Prusinkiewicz An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data

pp 

avialable as princetonedupubGraphicscolorquantshar  This code
in modified form appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well


 Converting color into grayscale

The NTSC formula is

    luminosity   red   green   blue


 Quantizing grayscale to blackwhite

The only reference you need for this stuff is

    Digital Halftoning Robert Ulichney MIT Press  ISBN 

But before you go off and start coding check out the image manipulation
software mentioned in item  below  All of the packages mentioned can do
some form of gray to bw conversion


 Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle

The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination
This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination  Instead
loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse
transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source
This method is quite general and can be used for any onetoone
D mapping not just rotation  You can add antialiasing by doing
subpixel sampling

However there is a much faster method with antialising included
which involves doing three shear operations  The method was originally
created for the IM Raster Toolkit see below an implementation is
also present in PBMPLUS  Reference A Fast Algorithm for Raster
Rotation by Alan Paeth awpaethwatcglwaterlooedu Graphics
Interface ' Vancouver  An article on the IM toolkit appears in
the same journal  An updated version of the rotation paper appears
in Graphics Gems see section  under the original title

 Format documents for TIFF IFF BIFF NFF OFF FITS etc

You almost certainly don't need these  Read the above item  on free
image manipulation software  Get one or more of these packages and
look through them  Chances are excellent that the image converter you
were going to write is already there  But if you still want one of the
format documents many such files are available by anonymous ftp from
zamenhofcsriceedu in directory pubgraphicsformats

These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct
This archive includes pixel formats and two and threedimensional object
formats  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as Mark
Hall foocsriceedu will apparently no longer be maintaining it

A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained
by Quincey Koziol koziolncsauiucedu  The latest version exists at
ftpncsauiucedu in miscfileformatsgraphicsformats  Apparently
neither of these is complete you might want to check both

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System It's a file format most
often used in astronomy  Despite the name it can contain not only images
but other things as well  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and
information posting on sciastrofits  read it if you want to know more



 Converting between vector formats

A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript or MacDraw
to CGM or whatever  It is important to understand that this is a very
different problem from the image format conversions in item   Converting
one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you
get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel  the basic objects
are the same for all image formats  This is not so for vector formats
The basic objects  circles ellipses dropshadowed patternfilled
roundcornered rectangles etc  vary from one format to another
Except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do
a onetoone conversion between vector formats

There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftppscedu  The
contributor states that it runs on Unix MSWindows and possibly the Mac
A better more specific blurb would be most welcome

On the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation
rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another
As far as I know no one has put together a general toolkit of such
converters but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been
posted to compsourcesmisc  Check the index on your nearest archive
site

A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmapped image  from PostScript to Sun raster format or HPGL to
X bitmap  For example some of the commercial PostScript clones for
PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer  Also
the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's XNeWs can
be used to render to a file if you're clever  But in general the
answer is no  However if someone were to put together a vector to
vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be
trivial

GNU ghostscript from the FSF  current version  includes
drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as
a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter  It implements
essentially all of PostScript level  and alot of Display PostScript
and level

 How do I draw a circle as a Bezier or Bspline curve

The short answer is You can't  Unless you use a rational spline you
can only approximate a circle  The approximation may look acceptable
but it is sensitive to scale  Magnify the scale and the error of
approximation magnifies  Deviations from circularity that were not
visible in the small can become glaring in the large  If you want to
do the job right consult the article

  A Menagerie of Rational BSpline Circles

  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications volume  number 
  September  pages 

For rough nonrational approximations consult the book

 How to order standards documents

The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards and also
ISO international standards  Their sales office is at 
mailing address is  Broadway NY NY   It helps if you have the
complete name and number

Some useful numbers to know

CGM Computer Graphics Metafile is ISO    GKS Graphical
Kernel System is ANSI X  PHIGS Programmer's Hierarchical
Interactive Graphics System is ANSI X  IGES is ASMEANSI
YM  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers
for example the GKS FORTRAN binding is X

Standardsinprogress are made available at key milestones to solicit
comments from the graphical public this includes you  ANSI can let

 How to FTP by email

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like send compsourcesunixfbm
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail

In addition there is at least one FTPbymail server  Send mail to
ftpmaildecwrldeccom saying help and it will tell you how to use
it  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse


 How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon

Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
infinity  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way
the point is within the polygon  If the ray crosses an even number of
edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior
hole formed from intersecting polygon edges  This idea is known in
the trade as the Jordan curve theorem see Eric Haines' article in
Glassner's ray tracing book above for more information including
treatment of special cases

Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all
the vertices on the polygon  If the sum is  pi the point is inside
if the sum is  the point is outside  However this method is about an
order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the
trigonometric functions is usually quite costly

Code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in
the Ray Tracing News Vol  No  available from princetonedu
pubGraphicsRTNewsRTNvnZ


 How to tessellate a sphere

One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles  The
base of the recursion is an octahedron and then each level divides
each triangle into four smaller ones  Jon Leech leechcsuncedu
has posted a nice routine called spherec that generates the coordinates

Height fields are a special case in raytracing  They have a number of uses
such as terrain rendering and some optimization is possible  Thus they

I am looking for a small utility that will convert a Microsoft Video AVI
file to an Autodesk Animator Pro FLC file Since AVIs also contain sound
it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a WAV or VOC
file Currently I'm accomplishing this by saving the AVI as multiple DIBs
using Video for Windows then converting each DIB to a GIF then loading the
GIFs into Animator For the sound I load the original AVI into WavEdit and
save it as a seperate WAV file This requires too many steps to be productive

Any help will be GREATLY appreciated

and turn them into thermal prints or negatives  I am looking for a place
as close to North Carolina as possible  The images will be created on
a Macintosh Quadra  running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored in
whatever format the vendor requires perhaps M cartridges

    The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a  dpi
scanner then modifiedcorrected by Adobe Photoshop  If anyone could help me
or even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful

    Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear
from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you
use andor any peripherals or software  It seemed the Quadra  would be
my best bet to modify photographic images  I am planning on buying a Quadra
 with Megs of RAM a Meg Hard Drive a  dpi scanner  Sony 
monitor and a Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM  I am new to
computers and any advice would be great

Does anyone truely understand the INVALID NORMAL ARRAY error ds gives
you while rendering  It seems to present itself while rendering
complicated images  I have circumvented this problem by rendering at
the command line however it would be nice to render inside the editor
Is this a memory problem

Could anyone tell me the format of GIF files  I would like to know how I 
could determine the size of the picture  Also are gif files in compressed

This is probally a simple question but I couldn't find it in the FAQ

A good reason which is why many companies use it for  bits  pixel
is so you can use double buffering for animating scenes  ie you have
  bit planes You write to the one in the background and then FLIP 
 the entire screen updates to the second imageplane The screen updates 
in one refresh and you don't see different objects appearing in the order 
that they're drawn as in the CADMacDraw effect Now your ready to update 
the image that used to be in the foreground

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave  self intersecting polygons 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line
Complex figure  type polygons can be a bit trickier

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concavemulti outline
algorithm but not tremendously faster  I spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about  faster  This is
all C on HP PARISC the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as
fast as possible as far as I could tell  For any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex  Definitely the
way to go

 a week per group  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum

 Just curious

Yes I also like knowing where to go to ask a question without getting
hell for putting it in the wrong newsgroup

I am also against splitting the group The traffic will decrease
on any given subject but the required net bandwidth will INCREASE
because of multiply crosspostings

I just went through this with another group I continuously read
It is now almost at the point where it is no longer worth reading

Strongly suggest NOT doing this

The problem is that XV can't I think convert images automatically and the
obvious alternative PNMPLUS PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER don't even get close to
XV's quality PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB even though the images

Hi all
I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color
Graphical BBS that supports PC Mac Linux and Amiga callers 
Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard a summary of 
which hit this group about  weeks ago 

I posted that document forgot part  etc but it was more than a summary
it was a complete technical description of the protocol It can be ftped
from simtel or from wuarchivewustledu in mirrorsmsdosnaplps

Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find
that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being
PP which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full
commercial software if they want to try out the BBS I know I wouldn't

Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC Mac Amiga I

Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the
code to the net Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms
NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
same as X but while X is intended for highbandwidth network connections
NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections

Is there a color version of MGR for Linux 

Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS 

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way If you
wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you
use SLIPPPP or would you invent some new way Most people would say that
SLIPPPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols so lets just
implement them I see it the same way with NAPLPS It is an existing well
thought out extensible protocol for online graphics so why not implement
it

If you need any advice on implementation just email me I am currently
getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well
enough to release it by May  If you or someone else does not get going
on a freely available NAPLPS decoder then I intend to do it after I get
a my conversion program out of beta and get a couple of other things done

I have a question about recursive backward raytracing

When an incident ray I strikes an object at point P first
the normal N is calculated Light rays are calculated L to Ln 
where n is the number of light sources  these being the light
rays that do not intersect with anything The reflected ray R and
the transmitted ray T is calculated from the formulae

Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 
along the rays R and T as rCol and tCol Each object has its own
colour oCol and each light source has liCol   i  n

The question is 
  How do you combine rCol tCol oCol and all the liCol's to get
  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray

All colours are defined as strucures records having r g b components
between  and 

If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints

A FTP site a book a company address 

OK it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it but I'm not THAT
optimistic

Thanks in advance for any help

I am looking for some information of hidden line removal using Roberts
algorithm  Something with code or pseudo code would be especially
helpful

I am required to do this for a class due Monday we have very little
time to implement these changes it is a VERY FAST paced class  The
notes given in class leave a LOT to be desired so I would vastly
appreciate any help

Actually any algorithm would be nice Roberts or no  The main problem
is two objects intersecting in x and y dimensions need to know which
lines to clip off so that one object will appear in front of another

If you can give me an ftp address and filename or even the name of a
good book I'd REALLY appreciate it

G'day Brian

I'll be blunt about this The ONLY reasonable explanation of Roberts
algorithm is in

Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics
Rogers
McGrawHill Book Co 

Go to the library and look at this

There is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition
of Newman and Sproull

The algorithm described in PECG runs in near linear time

	How can one dump to the printer the content of a VGA screen If it were
a text screen we can execute a shift printscr but with graphics we have
to do a pixed by pixel print It would be greatly appreciated if someone can
supply source code for this Alternately are there commercial or shareware
programs that are available to do this I must be able to shell out of my 
program to execute this print screen  Therefore it would be prefferable to have source code

Thank you in advance

Hi

I've noticed that if you only save a model with all your mapping planes
positioned carefully to a DS file that when you reload it after restarting
DS they are given a default position and orientation  But if you save
to a PRJ file their positionsorientation are preserved  Does anyone
know why this information is not stored in the DS file  Nothing is
explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the PRJ file 
I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information does anyone have 
the format for the PRJ file

Is the CEL file format available from somewhere

Does anyone know of software that will allow
you to convert CorelDraw CDR files
containing bitmaps to SCODAL as this is the
only format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises

Corel Draw will do it version  onwards If you have version  perhaps an
upgrade is in order

Another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take PostScript

Recent discussion about XV's problems were held in some newsgroup
Here is some text users of XV might find interesting

I have also minor ideas for bit XV email me for them

Deleted for space basically complaints that xv is an  bit program and that
making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates

In reverse order

 Try clicking in the autoapply box to switch it off Then make your mods Then
click on apply There is no problem as stated it has already been solved if you
look carefully

 Yes XV is an  bit program This is not a bug You can edit individual pallette
entries or do global colour changes crop scale etc Clearly the program must
save out the altered image else all your work would be thrown away So yes it
saves out  bit images  of course

XV can import  bit images and quantises them down to  bits This is a handy
facility not a bug

How would you suggest doing colour editing on a  bit file How would you group
'related' colours to edit them together Only global changes could be done
unless the software were very different and much more complicated

If you want to do colour editing on a  bit image you need much more powerfull
software  which is readily available commercially

And lastly JPEG is a compression algorithm It can be applied to any image of
arbitrary bit depth Again this is not a bug It is a way of saving disk space

ROME REBORN  THE VATICAN LIBRARY AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE
presents some  of the Vatican Library's most precious
manuscripts books and mapsmany of which played a key role in
the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of Greece and
Rome  The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican
Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
Renaissance  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson
Building of the Library of Congress from January   through
April    The online exhibit will be available by
anonymous FTP indefinitely

     The exhibit is divided into nine  sections  The Vatican
Library Archaeology Humanism Mathematics Music Medicine 
Biology Nature Described A Wider World I How the Orient Came
to Rome and A Wider World II How Rome Went to China  Each
section consists of its own subdirectory within the exhibit
directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
separate JPEG image files for each object  This online exhibit
includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit
but also the alternate objects brought from Rome to be used if
there were a problem with one of the primary objects and items
omitted later in the planning process

     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance
scholars in particular but also to art historians historians of
science or medicine early music scholars students of the
humanist movement students of printing and the printed word
theologians scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies and
to librarians and information professionals  Please get the
README file for details on what files this exhibit contains  If
you have questions about how to use FTP speak to your local
computer support person  If you have questions or comments about
the CONTENT of the exhibit please write to vaticankelllocgov

Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL
Version  did it quite well apart from a
few hassles with radial fills Version  RevB
is better but if you try to export in SCODAL
with a bitmap image included in the drawing
it will say something like cannot export
SCODAL with bitmap at least it does on my
version

Oh OK then sorry for misunderstanding

 If anyone out there knows a way around this
I am all ears
 Temporal images make a product called Filmpak
which converts Autocad plots to SCODAL postscript
to SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs 
and I was just wondering if there was anything out
there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad
cheaper

Maybee you should persuade your burea that for only  they can become much
more competitive taking input from Autocad PostScript andGif as well as
SCODL 

Seriously this sounds like something the bureau should have Or find another
bureau You should not be the one buting this software

	I was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a
reference to a bit graphics computerimage processing system  I seem to
remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that  Anyway he claimed
it had bit color  a bit alpha channel  That's  bits of infowhat
could that possibly be for  Specifically the bit color  That's 
trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  Is this an
antialiasing thing  Or is this just some magic number to make it work better
with a certain processor

Well  bit colour could be for improved resolution but  bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive I have seen a paper that quoted  bits per channel
of  bits for computational precision More than that would seem to be wasted

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range  RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding

Most likely however is that there are two separate  bit  bits per component
frame buffers This set up called double buffering allows a complex d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer containing the previous
frame is displayed This makes for smoother animation

sadly I have access to none of them  Just a DEC   Sigh

Well hey if you want to brag about numbers the  range can take a PXG Turbo
card with  bits per pixel Full double buffering Two  bit buffers a 
bit Z buffer and an extra  bit buffer for off screen image storage

Mind you the card costs more than your workstation

    Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear
from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you
use andor any peripherals or software  It seemed the Quadra  would be
my best bet to modify photographic images  I am planning on buying a Quadra
 with Megs of RAM a Meg Hard Drive a  dpi scanner  Sony 
monitor and a Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM  I am new to
computers and any advice would be great
 
well i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering
them  as for changing them back into negatives is that really possible
scanning and altering is no big deal i don't know what types of
features you have in your version of photoshop  but the one i use
which incidentally is on a quadra has gallery effects and all types
of other neato stuff
i'm just wondering why you would want to put your images back into
negatives because once you print the image outthat's your print
do you know what exactly your aim is in all of this  like are you
doing this just for fun for a business to gain more computer
knowledge for a project you're working on
otherwise i guess i don't know if i'd be helping or not by posting info
on scanning and stuff
ok  cool

Dear Netters


I am looking for C source code to test if a D point lies within a

concave polyhadra I have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist parity counting and angle sumation Both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not So I wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this

    Another 'rough' solition don't care special cases is raycasting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
M Tamminen et al  Raycasting and block model conversion
using a spatial index ComputerAidedDesigns   
But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra How this could be done in practice 
I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra How could I ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra  The paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case


   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal It says if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

I need triangulized data of some nice looking model with some
texture mapping It would be better if the parametric values
of each vertex for the surface before triangulized  are
avaliable along with the Euclidean points so that we
could use them for texture mapping

Thanks Kwansik

	Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with
	CGM ASN CDA DCA SGML or any one of a number of other
	very successful file format  People seem perfectly capable
	dealing with these others  Dealing with the format of TIFF
	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT LZW and
	FAX encoding of the image data  The majority of the libraries
	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather
	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters

	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather
	simpleminded formats such as GIF PCX and BMP but to suggest
	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous

	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine but don't even thing about
	using it in many instances  GIF is very nice for use in lowend
	photos applications and for screen grabs and such but it would
	never do for highvolume or highresolution systems  FAX is nice
	but it doesn't do color and GIF doesn't do BW all that well
	JPEG is nice for highresolution color but is slow for lowend

	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle
	all these situations and then some  Naturally it's more complex
	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging
	systems based on having to deal with  file formats anyday

	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes
	but please don't wrail against it's complexity  The complexity
	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and
	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially
	viable file formats


	If we're in philosophical arguments against complexity let's all
	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length
	encoding

asecchiacsuctacza Adrian Secchia writes
 When an incident ray I strikes an object at point P   The reflected
 ray R and the transmitted ray T is calculated from the formulae
 
 Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 
 along the rays R and T as rCol and tCol Each object has its own
 colour oCol and each light source has liCol   i  n
 
 The question is 
   How do you combine rCol tCol oCol and all the liCol's to get
   the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray

    First of all this is NOT a snide response if you're confused about
this issue you will stumble over a lot of other things as well  I suggest
that the weakness is your reference material  Get An Introduction to Ray
Tracing by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing
algorithm  You could also refer to the nd edition of Foley  Van Dam

    On to the question  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up
all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity  For
example if your intensity values range from  to  then keep adding up
and clamp the resultant values to  you might have to clamp the lower
bound to  if you have dark bulbs but that's another issue   So you
get some illumination equation like this

        I  Lambient  Ldiffuselightn  Lreflected  Ltransparent

    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light
intensity as is the light due to transparency  Now a slightly less
handwaving illumination equation is this

        I  KaLa  KdLdlightn  KrLr  KtLt

    That is each component of the illumination equation is governed by the
material constants Ka Kd Kr and Kt  So the maximum you can get from
transparency for a given object for example might be    for a
purplecolored glass object

    Hopefully this answers your question  I'll forward my illumination
equation sermon to you also

    Yes  There are many methods of rendering raytracing is one of them
You didn't say what you mean by rendering so I won't guess  Methods of
rendering include

        o  Pencil and graph paper doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the D projection

        o  Hidden line rendering

        o  Scanline rendering using
             Painter's algorithm
             BSP trees
             Z buffer
             Other

        o  Raytracing

        o  Radiosity

        o  Holographic projection to film

        o  Combination of any of the above

This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version
of a mac file so the Resource fork and Data fork get preserved
You need a program that converts this to a regular file If this is a
macbinary file you may have downloaded it in Text mode and is probably
corrupt if you did If you're using FTP to transfer it at any point make sure
you type binary first

If you can open the file with a text editor and find
This file must be converted with Bin
at the top it is a BinHex file and can be decoded with
BinHex  among other programs

better understand how SGML CALS ODA MIME OODBMS JPEG MPEG

EIATIA can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
TELEMATICMultimedia applications

We want to be able to support DOS UNIX MAC WINDOWS NT OS
platforms  It is our hope that individuals developers corporations
Universities R  D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor

This would be a NOTFORPROFIT group with bylaws and charter Already
many corporations have decided to support OTG Open TELEMATIC Group so
do not delay joining if you are a developer

An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon
be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject  If
you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
address below

This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPSJPEG
newsletter as well as a hardcopy version  We urge all who wants to
see CMCs HiRes based applications  the NAPLPSJPEG G R O W decide to
join and mutually benefit from this NOTFORPROFIT endeavor

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists
Similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using dataflow programming
IBM Visualization Data Explorer software and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources including video
recording equipment
 
Audience  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating stateoftheart
           computer graphics into their research computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization

	Hi
	Does anybody know any reliable utils to read english texts with scanner
	I want some analysis on quality of recognition because I want to read
	texts which I get by fax  you know  quality on faxes is rather bad 
	The scanner I have is BW and dpi But if there exist any good software
	that needs other specifications that will be OK
	
	Please send messages to my Email or on conference server I'll summarize
	them and consider your recomendations
	
	THANK YOU

I saw an imaging program some time ago on an Amiga that had
Cross Sobel and Roberts filters for edge detection 

Can anybody direct me to these algorithms

Don't overuse mail servers

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path avalidreturnemailaddress
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff

DEC's FTPMAIL

  Send a oneline message to ftpmaildecwrldeccom WITHOUT a Subject field
  and having a line containing the word 'help'
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want

  Note that the reply or answer command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL send an original mail message not a reply
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmailrequestuucpgwpadeccom
  address rather than to postmaster since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems

NFF

  Neutral file format  by Eric Haines Very simple there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from EHaines Also there's one written in VOGLE so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on
  Check in sites carrying VOGLE like gondwanaecrmuozau

OFF

  Object file format from DEC's Randy Rost rostkpccom
 The object archive server seems to be mothballed In a future version
 I'll remove the ref to it  nfotis 

  Available also through their mail server To obtain help about using this
  service send a message with a Subject line containing only the word
  help and a null message body to objectarchiveserverdecwrldeccom
  For FTP places to get it see in the relevant place There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI D machines called offpreview in
  godzillacglrmitozau  There are previewers for xview and sunview
  also on gondwana

TDDD

It's a library of D objects with translators tofrom OFF NFF
Rayshade Imagine or vort objects
Edited copy of the announcement follows from Raytracing News V

  New Library of D Objects Available via FTP by Steve Worley
  worleycupportalcom

  I have assembled a set of over  D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD These objects range from human figures to airplanes
  from semitrucks to lampposts  These objects are all freely
  distributable and most have READMEs that describe them

  In order to convert these objects to a humanreadable format a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB officially
  on hubcapclemsonedu that will convert ala PBM tofrom various
  object formats  Imagine TTDDD extension of TDDD OFF NFF
  Rayshade  or vort Source included for AmigaUnix as executables
  for the Amiga Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript

PD

  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center The PD uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store threedimensional models A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the PD release so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software

  The mousedriven user interfaces for Motif Open Look and Silicon
  Graphics GL and the DrawPD subroutine library for generating PD
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp

  The PD software currently supports nine renderers  They are

 Solids description formats


a EEC's ESPRIT project  CADI CAD Interfaces has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data curves surfaces and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA Computer Aided
  Analysis an CAM Computer Aided Manufacturing

b IGES v  now tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models  Brep and CSG The current standard number is ANSI YM
  For documentation you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards  ext 
  and the cost is 
  This standard is not available in electronic format

c PDESSTEP  This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information but also for things like FEM etc
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptservercmenistgov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body NOT the Subject area of the message

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab  are also working
  on STEP tools they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser
  both available in source form and for free for research purposes
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESSbased database system

 Image analysis software  Image processing and display


PC and Macbased tools multiplatform software


IMDISP

  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites Can do simple display
  enhancing smoothing and so on Works with the FITS and VICARPDS
  data formats of NASA Can read TIFF images if you know their dimensions
  PC and Macs

LabVIEW 

  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  program with graphical elements representing the programming elements
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram program  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering numerical analysis statistics etc  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument VI a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument

  National Instruments markets plugin digital signal processing DSP
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow realtime
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology The
  tools range from lowlevel debugging software to highlevel block
  diagram development software  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NBDSP board and LabVIEW
  Use of the NBDSP Analysis Library FFTs power spectra filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop MPW C
  that execute on the NBDSP board There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of readytouse VIs optimized for the NBDSP

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler an assembler and a linker for lowlevel
  programming of the DSP hardware  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NBDSP board This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code

Ultimage Concept VI

  Concept VI  by GraftekFrance is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments VIs that give LabVIEW  described above users highend
  tools for designing integrating and monitoring imaging control systems
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography
  surveillance machine vision production testing biomedical imaging
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement histogram equalization spatial and
  frequency filtering isolation of features thresholding mathematical
  morphology analysis density measurement object counting sizing and
  characterization

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of  by  a pixel
  depth of   or  bits and one image plane  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT TIFF SATIE and AIPD  Other formats can
  be imported

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations spatial
  linear and nonlinear filters frequency filtering arithmetic and logic
  operations and geometric transformations among others  Morphological
  transformations include erosion dilation opening closing hole
  removal object separation and extraction of skeletons among others
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection measurement and
  morphological distribution  Measures include area perimeter center of
  gravity moment of inertia orientation length of relevant chords and
  shape factors and equivalence  Measures are saved in ASCII format  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules

  A D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale The twentyeight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for masking and averaging
  sections of images noise removal making comparisons etc  There are
   spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity  These include highpass filters for contrast and outlines
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the real  imaginary  components or the phase magnitude
  data  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts

  The transformations include thresholding eroding dilating and even
  hole filling

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include area
  perimeter center of mass object counts and angle between points

  GTFS Inc  Bennett Valley Road C Santa Rosa CA 
  

IPLab Spectrum

  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  GraftekFranceUs Ultimage Concept VI  Using scripting tools the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention The tool
  supports FFTs  arithmetic operations for pixel alteration and a
  movie command for cycling through windows

ColorStudio and ImageStudio

  ColorStudio is an imageediting and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the  MB range  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the auto selection tool
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color close
  hues color range and mask

Image Analyst

  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of fieldproven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance count objects determine
  density shape size position or movement perform object feature
  extraction and conduct textural analysis automatically  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera or
  a diskstored image

  Within minutes without the need for programming the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semiautomatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size shape and
  position  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices

  There are  types of files the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing measurements and analysis that the user
  defines  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest ROI
  represented by movable sizable boxes atop the image  Inside a ROI the
  program can find the distance between two edges the area of a shape
  the thickness of a wall etc  Image Analyst finds the center edge and
  other positions automatically The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object It also
  supports histograms and a color lookup table CLUT tool

  Michael Landy cowrote and sell a generalpurpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil
  exploration etc  It is called HIPS and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well
  as a huge usercontributed library

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research
  system  development  and  teaching It  handles  sequences  of  images
  movies  in precisely the same manner as single frames

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations filtering convolution Fourier and other transform
  processing edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation digital
  image compression and transmission  methods noise generation and image
  statistics computation Over  such  image transformation programs
  have been developed  As a result almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently Additionally HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day

  HIPS features images that are  selfdocumenting   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  filters''  It comes complete with source  code  online manual
  pages and online documentation

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system  It is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation
  of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax Sun Apollo  Masscomp  NCR Tower Iris IBM AT etc
  For image display and input drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage Ikonas image processors and the Sun Sun Sun  and
  Suni consoles  We also  supply  usercontributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages Sun gfx Sun
  console Matrox VIP ITI IP Lexidata  Macintosh II X
  windowing system and Iris  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max
  Video HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because  of HIPS is machine independent

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an
  interactive  research tool and for more production oriented tasks It
  is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format either reel toreel or
  Sun  cartridge and comes with source code libraries a library of
  convolu tion masks and online documentation and manual pages

MIRA

 Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal These are altogether different beasts  nfotis 

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on  DOS computers using SVGA cards in
   color modes up to x MIRA contains a very handsomefunctional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated MIRA readswrites TIFF and FITS
  formats native formats of a number of CCD cameras and uncompressed binary
  images in byte short integer and byte real pixel format in  or 
  dimensions The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels or the same as that of the input image MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format Over  functions are handcoded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations  Windows for d image and d imagedata
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse  There are also smooth real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed images all operated by the mouse A wide selection of
  grayscale pseudocolor and random palettes is provided and other 
  palettes can be generated


Supported functions include such niceties as the following

o  image  image     interpolation
o  image  constant    
o  unary operations abs value polynomial of pixel value chs x log
   byteswap clip values at upperlower limits shortreal or realshort
o  combine images by mean median mode or sum of pixel values with or
   without autoscaling to mean median or mode of an image section
o  convolutionsfilters Laplacian Sobel edge operator directional gradient
   line Gaussian elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters unsharp

 First check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above

bit scanning

  Get a good bit scanner like Epson's Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News Volume   
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings etc from doll
  house supplies
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area

Books with textures

  Find some housesbooksmagazines that carry photographic material
  Educorp  sells CDROMS with various imagery  also
  a wide variety of stock art is available
  Stock art from bigname stock art houses such as Comstock
  UNIPHOTO and Metro Image Base is available

  In Italy there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work Their address is
	Edition Belvedere Co Ltd
	 Rome Italy
	Piazzale Flaminio 
	Tel   Fax   

Texture Libraries

a Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles a set of x bit
   textures Initial shipments in bit IFF for Amigas soon in bit
   TIFF format Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces SRP is   volume
   each volume   images   disks Demo disks for  are available

b ESSENCE is a library of  sixtyfive new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse Inc These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine  Imagine  and even Turbo Silver
   Written by Steve Worley

 Introduction to rendering algorithms


a RayTracing


  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics No Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains For RayTracing I would
  suggest
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing Andrew Glassner ed Academic Press
      ISBN 
  Note that I have not read the book but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book An errata list was posted in compgraphics by Eric Haines
  ericheyecom

There's a more concise reference also

  Roman Kuchkuda  UNC  Chapel Hill An Introduction to Ray Tracing in
  Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD ed RAEEarnshaw
  NATO AS Vol F pp  Printed by SpringerVerlag 

It contains code for a small but fundamentally complete raytracer

b Zbuffer depthbuffer


A good reference is

        Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics David F Rogers
        McGrawHill New York  pages  and 

c Others

 Where can I find the geometric data for the


a Teapot 


Displays on Display column of IEEE CGA Jan ' has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot

IEEE CGA Sep ' in Jim Blinn's column Jim Blinn's Corner describes
an another way to model the teapot Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution around xx triangles meshing per patch
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution

b Space Shuttle 


Tolis Lerios tolisnovastanfordedu has built a list of Space Shuttle

 Image annotation software


a Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good  It reads in
  rasterfiles but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile

b Idraw part of Stanford's InterViews distribution can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviewsstanfordedu

c Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X bitmap xbm
  and X pixmap xpm formats  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on csuclaedu
  Version  of tgif at patchlevel  plus patch and patch

d Use the editimage facility of KHOROS see below
  This is just one utility in the overall system you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdrawtype graphics using this package

e You might be able to get by with PBMPlus  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image

f 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows It's a PostScriptbased
  graphical editorand it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eosoesthawaiiedu  Requires Sun C  and
  two other locally developed packages the LXT library an Xlibbased
  toolkit and a small C class library All files pubicetarZ

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing

g Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pulldown menu  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats  ImageMagick is available as

WIT

  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVSExploreretc
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system IMHO
  Major elements are

   a visual programming language which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
   a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point filter io transform
  morphological segmentation and measurement operations
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast merge
  synchronization conditional and sequencing control strategies

  WIT delivers an objectoriented distributed visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CADlike workspace by adding their
  own operators C functions objects data structures and servers
  specialized hardware WIT runs on Sun HPxx SGI and supports
  Datacube MV hardware allowing you to run your graphs in realtime

IDLSIPS

  A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS This was
  developed at the University of Colorado Boulder by some people working
  for Alex Goetz  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it  It's a few thousand dollars American I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of besides what TerraMar has
  SIPS was written for AVIRIS imagery  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask  I
  have another piece of software PCW that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification you can compute an image using selected components  I've
  used it on  megabyte AVIRIS images without problems but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card  It will work without it but large
  images take quite a while  times as long to process  That's a
  freebie if you want it

  My  favorite is IDL Interactive Data Language from Research Systems
  Inc  IDL is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier Its
  programming language is very strong and easy  very Pascallike It
  handles the numbercrunching very well also Personally I like doing
  the numbercrunching with IDL on the VAX or Mathematica Igor or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle and the speed and ease of use
  compared to IRAF was incredible By the way it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing This means image enhancement
  cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image
  processing routines Then for example taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse then doing a curve
  fit to that line which I might do like in KaleidaGraph 

 For IDL call Research Systems  for PVWAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado  Boulder  From what I can
 understand you can get packaged programs from Research Systems though

GVLware Distribution
        Bob   An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz   A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol  Motif color editor


The Army High Performance Computing Research Center AHPCRC has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent D and D
data sets  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab GVL we are using
these tools along side standard packages such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit to render D volumes and create digital movies
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called GVLware

GVLware currently consisting of Bob Raz and Icol is now available
via ftp  The most interesting program is probably Bob an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen enabling movies larger than memory to be played  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz  Source and
prebuilt binaries for IRIX  are included

To acquire GVLware anonymous ftp to
        machine  ftparcumnedu

Some Bob features
        Motif interface SGI GL rendering
        Renders  cubed data set in  to  seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering in perspective
            only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris
        Data must be a Brick of Bytes on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation subvolumes subsampling stereo

Some Raz features
        Motif interface SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition then streams to screen
            requires an empty disk partition to be set aside
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB HSV and YUV color spaces multiple file formats

 GIS Geographical Information Systems software


GRASS

  Geographic Resource Analysis Support System of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab CERL It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration  You then compile the source code for your machine using
  scripts provided with GRASS  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget GRASS is not very
  userfriendly compared to Macintosh software A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines fft Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp in
  Boulder CO is a primary user of GRASS   This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multispectral  bands  volumetric
  rendering full color on Suns and Stardents It was a really effective
  interface  Vexcel Corp currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps You can call them
  at   or email care of gregvexcelcom 

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run AUX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data GRASS  is publicdomain and can run on a highend PC
  under UNIX It is rasterbased has some imageprocessing capability
  and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment I have used GRASS V on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use It is best of course for data that are well represented
  in raster gridcell form

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration OGI  maintains an ftp server
  mooncecerarmymil 

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grassftpadminmooncecerarmymil

  This location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software as
  well as bug fixes contributed sources documentation and other files
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  tar archiving of files  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial  Because the manual is still in betatest stage
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him commentscorrections The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document so all correspondence about it should be

Microstation Imager

  Intergraph based in Huntsville Alabama sells a wide range of GIS
  softwarehardware Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GISremote sensing flavor

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations flip mirror rotate generalized affine
  Rectification Affine nd rd th and th order models as well as a
  projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion  Principal component analysis
  Classification Kmeans and isodata  Fourier Xforms Forward filtering
  and reverse  Filters High pass low pass edge enhancing median
  generic  Complex HistogramContrast control  Layer Controller manages
  up to  images at a time  user can extract single bands from a  band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application it can handle
  VERY LARGE images and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun
  though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment

PCI

  A company called PCI Inc out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada makes
  an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard
  formats LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget  The software is available in versions for MSDOS Unix
  workstations among them HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly
  other platforms by now  I use the VMS version

  The PCI software consists of several classesgroupspackages of
  utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI
  database disk file  The Tape IO package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape
  formats INTO or write those formats out FROM the PCI database file
  this is the only package I use or know much about  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCIsupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer eg an Epsontype
  dotmatrix graphics printer  You might be more spe cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and
  Fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg
  multiply channel  by  add channel  and store as channel  and
  God only knows what all else  there's a LOT  I don't have and don't
  use these so can't say much about them you only buy the packages your
  particular applicationinterest calls for

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from
  a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default
  directory  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBMPC BASIC but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the PCI
  data structures database file parameter file

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the
  level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well  For instance the Tape IO package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multiband what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different
  interleave orders This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphicarts industry's CTT format would probably I haven't tried
  handle Targa and so on Above all however you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over  It's worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to
  contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of
  other information I observe that a remotesensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude
  longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this
  can go into the PCI database

  I believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  thirdparty display systems the name GouldDeanza seems to come to
  mind  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCTQ Qbus
  bit DirectColor display subsystem  PCI software COULD be overkill
  in your case it seems designed for the very high end
  applicationsusers ie those for whom a MacPC largely doesn't suffice
  although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada a country which
  does a LOT of its landresource management via remote sensing I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas

SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager

  Back in  JPL developed something called SPAM Spectral Analysis
  Manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery byte data   pixels
  across by   lines by   bands a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer which uses much larger images

  Spam does none of these things rectification classification PC and
  IHS transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays
  Actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  stretching  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR an executive based on TAE and may also require a frame
  buffer  I can refer you to people if you're interested  PCW requires X
  for display

I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
apparent precision in Zbuffering that I've encountered in  different
PEX implementations  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any
resources I can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex FAQ Gaskins's
PEXlibProgrammingManual vendors' documentation

I'm posting this article by itself on compgraphics and virtually the
same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on
compwindowsxpex  The problem is hard to describe without pictures
hence this article is longish  If you can run PEXlib x programs and
are interested I encourage you to build and run the test program in
compwindowsxpex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach
to dealing with it  It depends on the utility code from the above
Gaskins book instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given

The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching
artifacts resulting from the use of Zbuffering with polylines that are
coplanar with filled areas  The interpolated Z values along a line will
differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated Z values
across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
vertices of the area  Because of this it's a tossup whether the
Zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed
Visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the
line is supposed to be solid

Using the PEXlib API my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
different PEX view mapping transforms in two view table entries one
for the areas and one for the lines  The PEX structures or immediate
mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  The
result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines so as to
attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines

This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie
smaller VRC Z coordinates compared to their positions in the view
table entry used for areas  This means that when a point is transformed
to NPC its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias

I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the Zbuffer
typically from  to  if not  ie  or  bit Zbuffers
Therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC
between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
the stitching

But in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 
to  of the range  Empirically it's worst when the NPC Z
component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more
or less edgeon to the viewer  It's as if only  or  bits of the
Zbuffer have any dependable meaning  This amount is so great that one
problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through
areas which they are supposed to lie behind

I've observed the problem on both HewlettPackard and Digital
workstation PEX servers to approximately the same degree  The test
program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib x implementation
this version is known to compile and run on an HPUX system with PEX


Open questions
     Why does this happen
          Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly
          Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines
            as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which
            could be corrected for
          Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their
            interpolators
          Something else
     What to do about it
          Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
            in Zbuffered HLHSR
          Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching
            artifacts
          Am I just out of luck

Any help would be immensely appreciated

Now I have a couple raytracing questions
Just so you know I'm using PovRay  both MSdos and Unix and I'm generating Targa files of varying size

 ok so I can view these wonderful pictures on my screen  What's the best way  to get them on to paper  Would it be possible to take it to Kinko's and have   them make an actual picture on paper from it

 I was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced 
frames  Is this a bad idea  Any tricks to it




 How would I get a sequence of targa files made into an animation 
that I could put on a videotape  Is there a cheap way

Hello
I have some problem in converting tga filegenerated by POVray to
rle file When I convert I do not get any warning message But
if I use xloadimagegetx something is wrong

edited

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm but I do not spend
time to install them Even I do not want to generate rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle if possiblergb to rle works but
it will mess up my directory with so many files and it needs  more
steps to finally convert to rle file say cat  rawtorle  rleflip 
Does any body out there have same experienceproblems 


Well for starters why use rle files  You might have a specific program that
needs them OK but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format thus a meg
bit targa file becomes a k or less bit jpeg

The latest versions of XV   and xloadimage  both handle jpeg files
And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the cdjpeg suit  Even at 
quality you can't see the difference the jpeg is way smaller than anything
else even an bit gif

Later'ish

Okay I got enough replies about the Kubota KenaiDenali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities  I haven't actually used one
or seen one so take the specs with a grain of salt  I'd like to see
an independent review of one against say an SGI Indigo Extreme or
something

Basically the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that
run OSF  DEC's  and will likely run Windows NT in the future  They are
binary compatible with Digital's OSF Alpha AXP implementation  Denali
is their graphics subsystem which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding transformation engines

The two main Kenai machines are the  Imaging and D Graphics Workstation
and the  Imaging and D Graphics Workstation

Both have TurboChannel MBsec SCSI Ethernet and FDDI

APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

Both have libraries for Xlib Motif MIT PEXlib DECPEXlib DECPHIGS and GL

Okay now the real stuff  The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
known as Denali  The Denali comes in three models the E P and V  They
use a DECchip  superscalar RISC processor at MHz  Their
capabilities are as follows

As you can see these are pretty powerful workstations and the best part
is the pricing  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information
Their number is   I'm sure they'll send you an information you
may want  Oh some prices

Lowend

Kenai  E Series w  TEM and  FBM   dollars US

Highend

Kenai  V Series w  TEM and  FBM   dollars US

If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or
something I would appreciate it

Hope this helps someone out there

I've discovered a bug in the librariesparserparserc loadcolour function where it was generating a segmentation fault  It appears the colourList is geting corrupted somehow  I had it return random colours instead and everything worked great except for a few colour problems so I know its the only thing wrong

The colour table somehow gets a couple of nulls placed in it so when the name of the colours are compared it crashes  I haven't found the problem yet maybe someone else can

Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image
Processing I am looking for any material related to the field and am
also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
field In particular source code for general use packages

I already have several texts on the subject but would appreciate more
input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself I'm not
mathematically literate ie I don't have a degree in mathematics so
any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not
mathematically intensive

The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is

Practical Digital Image Processing
by Rhys Lewis
ISBN 
Published by Ellis Horwood c

Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
Image Processing techniques So far I have 'xv' and 'khoros' for Unix
'Dcview ' for the IBM PC and various related smatterings of C code
to help describe topics like contrasting dithering image enhancement
via convolution etc

If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
pertinent to this area or better still if they could tell me where I am
most likely to find it on the AARNET Internet If I can I would prefer
source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing
codealgorithms that I can readily altermanipulate for the purposes of
demonstration it would be most helpful

All the above information will contribute to my postgraduate studies
and will be liberally used in my paper and seminar on the subject

   OK with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime
   the effects of scaling and so on I thought I'd do some more tests

   First of all I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
   realistic The movie I had been using only had  frames in it it was a
   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor
   I decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results
   for better or for worse

   I pulled out a copy of  A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV
   a while back About fifteen minutes into the movie there's a sequence where
   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station Specifically I digitized
   a portion of about  seconds' duration zooming in on the rotating space
   station I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
   frames To increase the differences between frames I digitized it at only
    frames per second to give a total of  frames

   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of  pixels with the Spigot
   card in my Centris  quartersize resolution from a PAL source I then
   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor
   keeping the  fps frame rate I created two versions of the movie one scaled
   to  resolution the other at  resolution I used the default
    quality setting in Premiere  and specified a key frame every ten
   frames

   I then ran the  movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used
   for the results I'd been reporting earlier

   Result a playback rate of over  frames per second

   That's right I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
   test movie Just for fun I copied the  movie to my external hard
   disk a Quantum LPS and ran it from there This time the playback rate
   was only about  frames per second Obviously the MB internal hard disk
   also a Quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback

   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
   scaling factors and tried playing back the  movie scaled to 
   size This time the playback speed was over  fps Clearly the poster who
   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime  in
   action not  I'd try my tests with QuickTime  but I don't think it's
   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 

   Unscaled the playback rate for the  movie was over  fps

   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the  movie with
   preferred playback rates greater than  and seeing how well they played
   from within MoviePlayer ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback
   A preferred rate of    fps didn't work too well the playback was
   very jerky Compare this with the raw speed test which achieved  fps with
   ease I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
   much overhead I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
   switching

   A preferred rate of    fps seemed to work fine I couldn't see
   any evidence of stutter At    fps I think I could see slight
   stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell

   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
   key frames to make the stutter more noticeable Of course this will also
   improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance
   even more

I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that
can significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take
into account

 playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a
movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually  or 
bit but other depths are of course possible

 type of scaling QT is optimized for double size scaling other scaling
factors hit peformance much harder

 playback window position MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices
to advantagous pixel boundaries by default I'm not sure about Premiere

Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance  Image size
is of course another biggie  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also
make a real difference

Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm but I do not spend
time to install them Even I do not want to generate rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle if possiblergb to rle works but
it will mess up my directory with so many files and it needs  more
steps to finally convert to rle file say cat  rawtorle  rleflip 
Does any body out there have same experienceproblems 


Well for starters why use rle files  

Exactly

I didn't want to mess with tga or rle  So I wrote the following script 
All you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities 

This script is a pov to jpg converter  Just run it like this

  povjpg   fredpov 

You will need to modify the path's in the script to reflect where you put
povray and its include files  If you have a problem with disk space you
can use named pipes instead of temporary files

I hope you find it useful

RHI've noticed that if you only save a model with all your mapping planes
RHpositioned carefully to a DS file that when you reload it after restarting
RHDS they are given a default position and orientation  But if you save
RHto a PRJ file their positionsorientation are preserved  Does anyone
RHknow why this information is not stored in the DS file  Nothing is

    This is because the PRJ Project format saves all of your settings
    right down to the last render file's name

RHI'd like to be able to read the texture rule information does anyone have
RHthe format for the PRJ file

    Sorry Don't have anything on that or the CEL format

Could somebody please email me some info on either what gif or iff
file formats are or where I can get such info

Well GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by
Compuserve back in  or so  It was to create a format that could be
read and displayed by any system  GIF is limited to  bit color but has
a built in compression scheme LZW

IFF is not really a graphics format but rather a standard way to package
images sounds animations text or whatever into one file  IFF was
created by Electronic Arts I do believe I could be wrong for the Amiga
It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga
The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM InterLeaved
BitMap but many others exist  This format supports  bit color images

Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at
zamenhofcsriceedu in the directory pubgraphicsformats

it's really cool  It was created with government funds and sattelites

hi netters

	I'm doing a project which is about image analysis  Firstly I
have to find out any restrictions or limitations on the colour display
on various kind of workstations they are DECstation HP Amiga Apollo

	Secondly I read from some graphic texts that image is displayed
in  bitesplease point out to me if I got it wrong  But the images
which I will deal with are displayed in  bites by the software they
are using currently  So will there be any problems to display them
under Xwindows in the future Because we are thinking to implement the
GUI by Xwindows for our project


	Is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or
query above  Or give me some advice or suggestion where I can find
them out 

	Please send me an email if there are any  Thanks in advance

TO rychfestivaledacuk R Hawkes

RHI've noticed that if you only save a model with all your mapping planes
RHpositioned carefully to a DS file that when you reload it after restarting
RHDS they are given a default position and orientation  But if you save
RHto a PRJ file their positionsorientation are preserved  Does anyone
RHknow why this information is not stored in the DS file  Nothing is

    This is because the PRJ Project format saves all of your settings
    right down to the last render file's name

RHI'd like to be able to read the texture rule information does anyone have
RHthe format for the PRJ file

    Sorry Don't have anything on that or the CEL format

Well I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the PRJ file as much
as I needed to  extracted the mapping icon information  which is
when it dawned on me that D Studio is useless for my needs I need
a mapping icon per applied texture  I want to use a special purpose
graphics computer for rendering the DS models and it requires a texture
ruleplane to be specified in Space ie positionorientation of the
mapping rule  Since only one mapping icon is used in DS to apply
textures to ALL objectsfaces it renders no pun intended DS totally
unsuitable for my needs

Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a
PC  I must be able to specify texture rules one per texture and this
must be saved in a file which I can read  I haven't found any info on Alias
in the copy of the faq that I have

   LightWaveD MailList   

 WHAT IS LightWave 

LightWaveD is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the Toaster from NewTek Inc that operates on an
Amiga platform  The LightWave software LightWaveLightWaveD and
LightWave Modeler allows and artist to create three dimensional
photorealistic images for a variety of purposes

 WHY ARE WE DOING THIS 

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package  We hope to share information tips procedures and to bond as
a group

 WHAT ARE THE RULES 

Since LightWaveModeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster  However we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the D software related tools and products

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list

 OK HOW DO I JOIN 

To become a member of the LightWaveD mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address

        lightwaverequestbobsboxrentcom

In the body of the message enter

subscribe lightwavel yournameyoursitedomain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining  Expect a welcome message within  days after you
send your request  Then expect the mail to start flowing in

 HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST 

Contributing to the list is simple  Just mail your articles to the
following address

        lightwavebobsboxrentcom

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list  However those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you  So if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid your original article will be returned to you  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list  In fact just the
opposite is true It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address

NOTE I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon

 HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST 

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up

        lightwaverequestbobsboxrentcom

In the body of the message enter

unsubscribe LightWavel yournameyoursitedomain

I will remove your name from the list of members  PLEASE if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while send a request to be removed from the
list  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you


 WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES 

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site bobsbox  However I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates

If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI
hard drive to me for archival purposes grin

I have setup a mailbased file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the LightWaveD mailing list For information on this service please
send a mail message to

        fileserverbobsboxrentcom

The first command to the server must be HELP or USER name passwd

Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile
Use USER name passwd to connect to the service
Use     to get a short listing of all available commands



 NOW WHAT DO I DO 

Well sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information  If you have
something to offer please feel free to contribute that information to
the list  Every little bit helps  Questions are welcomed  It makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them grin

If you have any questions or comments regarding the list please contact
me at the address

        lightwaveadminbobsboxrentcom

Cheers

Does anyone know if a digitized version of the GeoSphere image is

it's really cool  It was created with government funds and sattelites
as a research project so I would assume it's in the public domain

Thanks for any info

 I have a copy of 'The EarthFrom Space' on my wall that I purchased
from Space Shots Inc LA CA     As printed on the
poster the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project
The image IS copyrighted so I doubt that you'll find it legally in
the public domain  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
GeoSphere Project an environmental education thing and the cost is
nominal so crack a  and buy one  Also I don't think it's always
safe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project any
products will be provided for free  Many government agencies NASA NOAA
and some private groups National Geographic provided assistance to the
GeoSphere Project  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
educating the public rather than pure research

This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version
of a mac file so the Resource fork and Data fork get preserved
You need a program that converts this to a regular file If this is a
macbinary file you may have downloaded it in Text mode and is probably
corrupt if you did If you're using FTP to transfer it at any point make sure
you type binary first

If you can open the file with a text editor and find
This file must be converted with Bin
at the top it is a BinHex file and can be decoded with
BinHex  among other programs

I opened the file with a text editor and it looks like

Vnetwork storyboardpictPICTBIME

I have already tried BinHex which does not seem to work 
Any other ideas

Can I view JPEG files without special hardware
  
    Lucy Wilson Access Services Librarian
    College of Engineering University of Cincinnati

Yup

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support
only specific video cards Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for
the VGA x  colour mode but they leave out the other cards such as
the Hercules monochrome card which by the way can give very good picture
quality if your dithering works right

I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to
GIF's before viewing them But some require VESA driver for the video cards
You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA
card and maybe a  processor Most people these days program for 
computers and neglect the rest of the  processors   I have a
 clone a NEC V processor and a Hercules card I have had to write
some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other
colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card I use FloydSteinberg
dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette
the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would
when viewed on other monochrome systems CompuShow  has FS dithering but
it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering my way
gives a brighter more detailed image

Anyway enough of my rambling in the wrong direction The final point is as
far as I know you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the
VGA and perhaps a  or better

Have a day

We have MSPublisher for manipulating text but it is not suitable for doing
much with graphics so she needs a more specialised tool Right now she's
looking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw There seem to be more books in the

basis of popularity Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which 
package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative
available If this is a FAQ please withhold the flames and just send the

it's really cool  It was created with government funds and sattelites
as a research project so I would assume it's in the public domain

used as a texture map in a planet orbiting simulation That program

I'm working on a system which uses a given set of D key frame
positions xyz to control an imaginary camera movement  I'm
using KochanekBartels splines as described in the SIGGRAPH '
proceedings to create a variable number of inbetweens between
the key frames  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form
xyzdxdydz where the last three argumentsa are the x y and
z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
positioned at xyz

The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the
positions of the inbetween view points to be generated  I've
tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
chord between the two adjacent view points which in general are
not key frames but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
viewing direction vector at the key frame positions although
the spatial movement seems to work fine and I'm quite certain
 I think   that I've not simply made an implementation
error

Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors
I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at

  David Gorgen writes

 I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
 apparent precision in Zbuffering that I've encountered in  different
 PEX implementations  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any
 resources I can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex FAQ Gaskins's
 PEXlibProgrammingManual vendors' documentation

 

 The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching
 artifacts resulting from the use of Zbuffering with polylines that are
 coplanar with filled areas  The interpolated Z values along a line will
 differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated Z values
 across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
 vertices of the area  Because of this it's a tossup whether the
 Zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed
 Visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the
 line is supposed to be solid

 Using the PEXlib API my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
 different PEX view mapping transforms in two view table entries one
 for the areas and one for the lines  The PEX structures or immediate
 mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
 effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  The
 result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines so as to
 attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines

 This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
 in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie
 smaller VRC Z coordinates compared to their positions in the view
 table entry used for areas  This means that when a point is transformed
 to NPC its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
 if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias

 I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
 to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the Zbuffer
 typically from  to  if not  ie  or  bit Zbuffers
 Therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC
 between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
 the stitching

 But in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 
 to  of the range  Empirically it's worst when the NPC Z
 component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more
 or less edgeon to the viewer  It's as if only  or  bits of the
 Zbuffer have any dependable meaning  This amount is so great that one
 problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through
 areas which they are supposed to lie behind

 I've observed the problem on both HewlettPackard and Digital
 workstation PEX servers to approximately the same degree  The test
 program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib x implementation
 this version is known to compile and run on an HPUX system with PEX
 

 Open questions
      Why does this happen
           Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly
           Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines
             as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which
             could be corrected for
           Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their
             interpolators
           Something else
      What to do about it
           Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
             in Zbuffered HLHSR
           Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching
             artifacts
           Am I just out of luck


We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations  I was also
shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by
about  bits assuming  bit z buffer  This seems huge but is only
 of the dynamic range  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad  What
is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due
mainly to roundoff I believe  So the polygon is not planar in z but is
more like a Ruffles potato chip  Ditto with lines  When you startend at
different xy values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the
stitch effect  You have the same problem if you try to draw  polygon
right on top of another but with different vertices  You will likely see
a smeared effect where they overlap
  Example
  Try Polygon     
      Polygon     

Your implementation is correct  In fact we do a similar trick when
rendering primitives that have lines and polygons  such as NURBS surfaces
with isoparametric lines  Without the trick the lines appear stitched as
you say  When the application draws linespolygons independently the
system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the
application must do it  This is what you have discovered and are doing

I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound What i want to do is
the following

From a fast source eg a CDROM several sound sources are read each having
it's own defined position and other attributes eg direction etc  Given the
listeners position and direction the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source  I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation  Additionally some
reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation kinda like some radiosity algorithm  

Have someone done this andor written articles on implementing such a system 

Please post or mail any answers or comments

scanning and altering is no big deal i don't know what types of

i'm just wondering why you would want to put your images back into
negatives because once you print the image outthat's your print
do you know what exactly your aim is in all of this  like are you
doing this just for fun for a business to gain more computer

I am just trying to find a vendor who can convert my computer stored

According to the literature it will do quadruple buffering so that you
can have double buffered stereo output

                      Genoa Presents High Performance 
                        Video Graphics Accelerator

        SAN JOSE Calif USA  Genoa Systems Corporation announces 
WINDOWSVGA   a True Color bit graphics accelerator card that 
delivers up to  million colors at speeds faster than the 
competition  Plus it offers a full range of resolutions high 
refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features  
The card is available in both bit ISA bus and bit VESA Local 
bus versions models  AND VL
        With MB DRAM on board the WINDOWSVGA  card offers 
maximum resolution up to  x  and supports a refresh rate 
of Hz at  x  and resolution up to  x  
noninterlaced Both models provide performance many times greater 
than standard SVGA boards yet conform to all current video 
standards
        WINDOWSVGA  features Genoa's FlickerFreetm technology 
which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more 
comfortable  the cards also come with Safescantm a utility 
developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen 
and thereby provide percent screen use for overscanning monitors
        WINDOWSVGA model VL takes full advantage of the speed 
offered by the new VESA Local bus technology  Most VL bus cards 
will only handle data transfers up to MHz but the VL will 
transfer data at the full speed of the CPU up to MHz  Genoa is 
also offering this card in the TurboBahn combination packaged 
with their TURBOEXPRESS VL motherboard
        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD GUI accelerator 
WINDOWSVGA  offers the user an exceptional priceperformance 
value  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to turbocharge 
the chip thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with 
power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced 
chip cards  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and 
reliability for such programs as Windows AutoCAD AutoShade D 
Studio OS OrCAD and more  Driver updates and product bulletins 
are available on Genoa's BBS at  
        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of 
graphics adapters motherboards audio and multimedia cards for 
IBMcompatible personal computers  All products come with a two 
year limited warranty on parts and labor  Genoa products are 
currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors

Recently we have found TIFF manipulation packages which do not recognize
TIFF files output by xv  This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION
tag which apparently is required or at least believed to be required for
valid TIFF  I have checked both xv x and xv x and neither of these
do indeed copy these tags

Has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags
I have been told that I could find some code in tifftoolstiffcpc but
that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv  I
hope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it but would prefer
to find code already known to work in xv

I am looking for a shareware graphics package called NeoPaint v  I 
saw it in a shareware catalog and was hoping that I could FTP it from 
the net but have been unable to locate it  I have tried Archie and I 
have gone through the entire compgraphics newsgroup looking for some 
reference to it and have found none  I have  also looked through the 
FAQ and also no reference  The program is called NeoPaint v and if 
anyone has heard of it or knows where I can get it I would appreciate 
it

Suggestions for other PC based shareware paint programs would also be 
appreciated Email me your responses

Much thanks

Keywords D widget manipulation feedback user interface design system

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
D interactive applications what types of D widgets you would
like to have in your applications  

A D widget is usually located in the same scene as other D objects of the 
application  It may let you

 manipulate application data the camera
  D objects in the scene and so on or
 view the status of the application or D objects
  via the widget's shape color position orientation and so on or
 do whatever I missed but you think is possible

For example a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball shown as a
partially transparent sphere superimposed on the object to be rotated
A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to  objects  The length
of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
ruler indicating the distance  A widget can provide both manipulation and
feedback  For example the ruler can be used to change the distance between
the objects along its own axis


Please email me or post your opinions on D interaction  The information
I gathered will help me design a D UI construction tool
Your help is very much appreciated

 Does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling but not both
 simultaneously

lionessmaplecircaufledu
 Stereo support              yes                     yes
 Other                      both machines will double buffer or do
                             stereo output per window  Both have an
                             auxiliary video output that is RSA
                             NTSC and PAL

pmartzdsdescom Paul Martz
 Same question again does this mean they can either do double
 buffering or stereo but not both simultaneously

    For both these questions it's an inclusive or  Alpha plus stencil is
supported they're separate as is doublebuffered stereo

          laer Design Research Center in cooperation with  IEEE  and  SIG
          GRAPH   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con
          tinents   A  good  crosssection  of  the  PHIGS  community  was
          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS
          users workstation vendors thirdparty PHIGS implementors stan
          dards  committee  members  and  researchers  from  industry  and
          academia  The opening speaker Dr Richard Puk challenged PHIGS
          users  to  take  charge of your PHIGS by participating in PHIGS
          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS
          implementors    The   closing  speaker  Dr  Andries  Van  Dam
          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  beyond
          PHIGS

I am considering creating a demo for the IBM PC for my band
I would like to combine interesting graphics and a sample of 
my music in the program  I have seen things like this
done for other platforms and even a few for the PC but since
I'm completly new to this I have no idea wher to start
I'm pretty sure that I am not skilled enough to put this 
together but I was hoping that you collectivly could
A Let me know what issues I need to worry about things I
   Should take into consideration when developing the 
   concept
B Perhaps someone knows of a programmerartist who would be interested
   in this type of a project

I know these are rather broad questions but any information
would be most helpful  Thanks

Does anyone know where I could get some source code for a GIF viewer on a PC
It doesn't have to be fancy it would be best if it were written in C to 
display gif pictures on a VGA screen  I was hoping to get it for free
from an FTP site but I haven't been able to find it yet

Usually you apply

R                     Y
G          U
B                     V


after unlevelshifting U and V subtracting  from them

This matrix multiplication may give results out of RGB space so you
have to clamp the resulting bytes to 
The conversion should be done with arbitrary big integers not floats 

This applies to YUV data whereas NTSC may have YIQ where a  degree
rotation to UV is buid in

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave  self intersecting polygons 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line
Complex figure  type polygons can be a bit trickier

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concavemulti outline
algorithm but not tremendously faster  I spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about  faster  This is
all C on HP PARISC the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as
fast as possible as far as I could tell  For any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex  Definitely the
way to go


Ok thanks for help everyone I still haven't found quite what I'm looking for
but I've got finals coming up soon so I have to put all this on hold

We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place
in TelAviv university We have two databases that we are currently working
on but we would like to work on more databases possibly more complicated 
and ones that will give prettier images

Before I describe what kind of data we need let me mention that we are 
going to present a paper titled PhotoRealistic Imaging of Digital Terrains
which describes the research and the results in the EUROGRAPHICS' 
conference in Barcelona this september We are going to show a videotape 
with some of our results so any good data that we will receive will be 
presented in the tape with a mention of the donator

We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs 
and terrain elevation maps DTM 
Each database consists of a D array of height values any data format can
be used for each value and a corresponding D array of color values can
be graylevel color value or full bit RGB values Other format can
also be used We work on X and x resolution databases

If anybody has access to this kind of data or knows where we can get such
data files please respond in this news group or  better  email us
directly 

amitmathtauacil    Amit Shaked or
dannyindigobguacil Daniel Cohen

Of course the names of the people who will help us get the data will be
cited in our paper and in further publications

More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics
workstations so here is some more info on the KenaiDenali vs the
ES Freedom


Here is the text of a Denali vs ES Freedom done by DH Brown Associates



Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics
subsystem in several aspects of its highlevel design  Both products use
a parallel array of  processors for geometric computations  Both
have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of
pixel processors  As a result Denali and Freedome overlap significantly
in performance and functionality  Both design teams also appear to have 
similar philosophies with respect to modularity scalability and market
penetration

There remain however several important differences between the KPC and
ES products  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a highend
developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and
flexibility  In its favor Freedom has configurations from two to
sixteen floating point units a border range that starts and ends at
a higher price and performance levels than Denali  All Freedom
systems include a large fixed number of pixel processors that
support a broader variety of color blending functions  The Freedom
design treats its entire image memory as generalpurpose memory allowing
developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of specialpurpose
applications  Finally ES provided Freedom with very flexible otput and
video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications  Note
that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not
require an external video encoder  ES programmable output features
however will remain much more flexible

The KPC design team in contrast made Denali more of an enduser's system
Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than lowend
Freedom configurations and come in at more realistic mainstream price
points  Denali does not need as many  modules as Freedome because
it uses a deeper scanconversion pipeline to support each one resulting
in better costperformance characteristics  Although both products provide
strong support for D imaging and volume rendering KPC recognized that
not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities  Denali's
configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase
geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately and to upgrade
them separately as needed

Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at
workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive
VGXT and RealityEngine systems  the only other products to provide
this capability  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation
of textures in hardware but provides only software support for the higher
qualtiy trilinear interpolated mipmapping method  On balance however Denali
provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than ES for most applications
Aside from being much more affordable KPC solutions deliver more parallelism
for texture processing and more offscreen memory for general graphics
data storage  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation
modules ES foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels
to obtain better texturing performance  Kubota avoids this problem by linking
texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules providing a lowercost more scalable
solution

Hope this helps

 Yes XV is an  bit program This is not a bug

Never claimed it is a bug


XV can import  bit images and quantises them down to  bits This is a handy
facility not a bug

Never claimed it is a bug


How would you suggest doing colour editing on a  bit file How
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated
If you want to do colour editing on a  bit image you need much
more powerfull software  which is readily available commercially

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to
many newsgroups

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the bit image
This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing images

Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations


And lastly JPEG is a compression algorithm It can be applied to any
image of arbitrary bit depth Again this is not a bug

Never claimed it is a bug
I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than
a compression algorithm because I know what the JPEG is
You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
places so far

You also missed what is were wrong with XV However I did wrote it

cartoon images into custom clip art but you can't expect to just point to

a lot of work You need to trace a drawing piece by piece and then put it

Can anyone provide me with a colour space transform that would
emulate the effects of redgreen colour blindness I have had
a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results
Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help
 
Certainly Reference follows 

Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
redgreen colour blind One protanopia is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the L cones those that respond best to long
wavelengths This gives much reduced redgreen and redviolet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision

The other deuteranopia is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the LM cone difference signals in the retina
It also gives reduced redgreen discrimination but redviolet is unaffected 
Unlike protanopia reds are not dimmer than  normal

On a uniform chromaticity diagram  the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books  there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point For protanopia the point is at u'v' very close to the far red
corner For deuteranopia the point is at u' v'

Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup random errors and so on The values quoted are typical

So if all colours on a line are seen as the same which colour is actually seen

This problem has now been solved Tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse For protanopes this joins up nm and nm on
the spectral locus the edge of the horseshoe for deuteranopes the line is
very similar  joining nm and nm

So to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia

 Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
 Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
 Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
 This is the new chromaticity 

The best reference for this is Meyer GW  Greenberg DP  'Colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays' IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications  

You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram

I would like to write a program probably a PPM filter to allow
previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour
blind users Not being colour blind myself this is a bit difficult

Yes this is certainly possible You will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on and
the chromaticity of the white point This information can be measured or
obtained from the manufacturer I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago

The procedure for each pixel  is as follows Some lookup tables might be a
help here

A convert RGB to CIE XYZ This is a simple  matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data
B retaining the Y component for later convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'
using u'  XXYZ v'  YXYZ
C find the equation of the line as in step  above
D find the intersection as in step 
E convert back from u'v' to XYZ using the Y value from step A
F Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor if not move it
along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey ie half way between black and
white until it is displayable

Please email replies  I will summarise and repost if there is
sufficient interest

Done also posted for the rest of us

Does anyone know of any c or c libraries for preparing
and displaying quickly pages of mixed text mathematical equations
and graphics circlesellipsesetc on the vdu The maths wouldnt
need to be up to TeX quality but it would be useful to be scaleable
The main thing would be to be able to generate the display quickly
from a minimum set of formatting code
Thanks

 If people would read this book  percent of the questions in this

	Not really I think it is less than 

Or alternatively  of the questions cover  of the topics in this group 
making them frequently asked

So the other  cover  of the topics making them rarely asked and thus in
sore need of answering

 moved on a bit

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the bit image
This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing images

Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations

Think about what you are saying here The  bit image is quantised down to 
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways You then want to apply these
modifications back to the  bit file so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour Ok you could do this by copying the  bit file to a
 bit file and using the extra  bits to hold the index entry 
Having done this you need to do something to them  what exactly

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
 It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry However I suspect this would look
rather odd

So in summary what I said in my previous posting still holds

How would you suggest doing colour editing on a  bit file How
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated

If you want to do colour editing on a  bit image you need much
more powerfull software  which is readily available commercially

In other words to edit a  bit file you need software built for the job
Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves

As to the other bits  you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV If
that was not what you meant then

You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
places so far

Yes I probably did I found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was Sorry
if I misunderstood

You also missed what is were wrong with XV However I did wrote it

Yes again What is was wrong with xv

	Hello
	can anybody help me to find a program that converts a format named
	raw also known as img to the gif format or jpeg one
	It's desirable to be for a unix machine than for a PC

	
	Raw format of a NN image is a file that contain a tail of

G'Day All

I'm looking for a program to convert BMP images to GIF TGA or even PPM

I'd prefer a unix program but Dos is fine also

I've seen Alchemy for DOS and some windows image viewers which can save
an image in other formats but what I'm after is a converter not a viewer

Any help would be apprieciated

Can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information not
books I'm too poor regarding programming the standard graphics modes
xx and xx are easy enough but I'm not so sure about the
rest  Something about planes or something and writing to ports and the
like but I don't know the numbers or anything  for the  color modes I
think  If I'm wrong let me know  Also xx is just one bytepixel
that's easy enough but are there any other ways to write to the screen
perhaps bytes at a time or something like that

Of course I'd appreciate any information about any mode  which reminds
me of another question  do the SuperVGA modes work the same generally
as the normal  and  color modes or is not only the mode numbers
for various cards different but the methods for writing to the screen
different as well

Thanks for any help you can give me  I'm developing a screen class for
C and find myself searching for information  Oh I do have Ralf Brown's
Interrupt List which has given me tons of invaluable information already
It just doesn't go into the screen programming details except for the
readwrite pixel BIOS calls

Thanks again

	be sent to another arbitrarily chosen participant
	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see 
	fit  For purely digital artists this may consist
	of filtering the image through their favorite paint
	program  For analog artists this may well be
	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their
	own part with pen pencil or whiteout then scan
	ning in the image again to be transferred on to

	are due by midnight on Sunday May th

	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin
	on May st  All artists will do what they think 
	it takes to finish up the image they've been given
	using whatever technique they see as worthy

Dear Prospective Employer

I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software
design and development in which I can utilize my experience in hardware 
C  C programming graphical user interface GUI operating systems and
computer networking

I received my Bachelors of Engineering BE degree in Electronics
Engineering in  and a MS degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec  
from Iowa State University Currently I am enrolled in a MS in Computer
Engineering at Iowa State University

During my Masters program as a research assistant since Jan  I have
published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics
These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability
to learn new concepts quickly

I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and
have extensive experience programming in C C Fortran and Assembly Level 
I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix Ultrix and MSDOS
I am familiar with MotifX programming and currently as a research assistant
am involved in graphical user interface GUI design using the multiplatform 
GUI toolkit XVT My experiences also include areas such as operating systems
and computer networks through course work and projects I was involved in the
study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating
system I have also been involved in many TCPIP programming projects in
computer networking

While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication
I have also learned a lot about time management In my MS program I
have maintained a  grade average worked  hours per week and
have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities

My software experiences along with my hardware background Electronics
Engineering would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer
I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed I would like to
have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals 
I am eager to hear from you soon


Sincerely

       I read a mesg somewhere on GENIE about Intel coming out with a 
graphics standard called PCI which would supplant VESA standards  Is
this a rumor or is there some substance to it If any of y'all have
heard of this standard please email me on how I might obtain more info

Hi there
        I'm using POvRay on my IBM compatible at home but I would like to 
run some things at work on our VAX computer I believe there is a version 
of the source code for POVray that is VAX specific but I'm not sure where 
to find it I've looked at the several sites where the IBMPC version of it 
can be found Can anyone help me

Thanks in advance

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the bit image
This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing images

Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations

Think about what you are saying here The  bit image is quantised down to 
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways You then want to apply these
modifications back to the  bit file so you have to find which
colours mapped to this one palette colour

I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed
We discussed about errors in XV  which shows images only as bit
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it

So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV  that is there
must be a colormap anyway The problems you present are exist anyway
and I didn't tried to solve them at all because I would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to bit image
as I presented There's no need make tricks from bitquantized image
back to  bit image


How would you suggest doing colour editing on a  bit file How
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated

Ok you're writing about situation that user want edit images as bit
and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way
jumps off the discussion a bit

My solution doesn't work because there's no colormap withing real bit
image  you see user see bit image going back to bit is silly


About changing individual colors in bitquantizedrasterized image
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image
XV allows this feature but I don't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images

Moreover XV is not a paint program you can only make those global
changes In full bit XV changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job
If person have bit screen there's need for tricks to get the
original bit image modified Because user don't see full bit
image there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if
image is rasterized To select indiavidual color there could be x
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area 
selecting individual color is possible from that

Ok I don't have thought very much bit painting programs never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such Not to mention
bit painting program in bit screen


Yes again What is was wrong with xv

It saved bitquantizedrasterized images as bit jpegs jpeg is not
designed for that
Also human expect that bit will be saved as bit image say
person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is
expected that the image still is the same So XV were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work  design error

I have heard XV were designed first for bit imagesfiles but
it were not good idea to take full bit images without making
major change to the original design

So even all screen images are bit the processed images and saved
images could have been bit very easily instead of bit

Before anybody will make a note yes I may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however
even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn't solve the problem
Americans the lift is just an example 


Well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to
read it

You can use PBM's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw r g b files to pgm format Then you can use pgmtoppm to convert the pgm files to a composite ppm file
and feed this to cjpeg for compression Slow and circuitous but it will
work

In article AAenetgwpadeccom you write
Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with
CGM ASN CDA DCA SGML or any one of a number of other
very successful file format  People seem perfectly capable
dealing with these others

Well yeah but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode
rectangular bitmaps  And the others are hardly trouble free  I hear that
it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate

The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the  useful
options there are  stupid options  The most egregious example is that
rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently
in all TIFF files byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on
all machines no matter what their natural byte order have to be prepared
to do byte swapping  There are four slightly different FAX formats 
again any one of them would have been adequate  RGB images can be stored
by pixel or by component complexity without function etc etc  I also
note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably
compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats suggesting that
none of the FAX formats are really useful

What's worse a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well
eg LZW limits code words to  bits while  or  bits would have
provided substantially better compression  And the LZW method compresses
bytes rather than pixels

But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register
proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them
This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably
read all incoming TIFF files  Some standard

PEXLIB and PHIGS as it comes from MIT with PEX and as is explained in the
PHIGS Programming Manual are just different API's for the PEX protocol
which is an extension to the X protocol

So it depends on You what you go to use

Advantage of Phigs is the protability to other platforms IBM GraPhigs 
SunPhigs and the standardized structuring of the D objects

Advantage of PEXlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for
immediate mode graphics because PEX is not an exactly mapping of Phigs

vamilliron  Yes Intel's PCI is another Local Bus standard which
can be used for graphics although I believe Local Buses can be used
for other things too  As far as I know though PCI Local Bus 
would compete with VESA Local Bus not the VESA graphics standard but

Get the generic version for Unix and VMS and build it IMHO a
VMS com file to build it is supplied
As the distribution comes as tarZ you should either have uncompress
and tar on VMS or a UNIX flavoured machine handy
Usually you won't find this on IBMPC specific archives but on the better
ones

I was wondering if anyone has ever seenheard of a utility that converts
any type of image format giftiffpcxbmpjpegetc to an ascii
representation  I have seen some very sophiticated art in ascii format but
never was I able to find the author or any program that may have converted
the data from a picture format

Any help or leads would be great Thanks in advance

dropping support for the Personal Iris DEC customers are pissed at DEC for
dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes and Apple customers
seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and
cheaper than the one they just bought  When I used to be a Sun customer

Please help

I have an IBMcompatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen  While I
was working with it this morning the screen started to flicker a little
which I thought was odd since I do use a surgeprotector for my computer and
all peripherals  It only did this for a second and then stopped

I left the room for several minutes and when I returned the screen was
completely dim not blank but very very dim  The contrast slider still
worked so that I could adjust it to where I could faintly make out what
was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely no effect

I was pluggedin at the time ie not using the battery but I still
tried switching the battery changing the powersaver features etc etc
all to no avail

Has anyone else experienced anything like this  If this just means that I
need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the
death of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
happened  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the
net about this because I already know what they'll say Yep you gotta have
this replaced and it's gonna cost you 

I've only had the computer for about  months  Is that a reasonable life
cycle for a LCD display  Oh I guess I ought to give specifics here the
brand is Compudyne Is this a reputable company it's a SX   MHz
I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down
before coming in to work today

If anyone can help me PLEASE give me any advice you might have  I'm not
opposed to having it replaced but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely
necessary  If you wouldn't mind please email me at mikemikukyedu
but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days

BTW if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere feel
free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and
name of the FAQ if you don't mind

Thanks in advance for any help

No MIS folks have infinite budgets of death and they also get parts
of their budget allocated upgrades maintenance and new purchases
and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually leases and so
is the software

Basically the engineers who have tight budgets ie the coders and
designers of a company bitch and moan when they drop  on a 
Sparc  only to see a faster machine appear a year later  MIS types
upgrade once every  years and their costs are amortized and
depreciated over a longer period and the budget office justifies
the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting
payroll etc

Now if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some
reason like payroll and accounts you'd sure as hell see every
engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the bit image
This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing images

Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations

Think about what you are saying here The  bit image is quantised down to 
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways You then want to apply these
modifications back to the  bit file so you have to find which
colours mapped to this one palette colour

I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed
We discussed about errors in XV  which shows images only as bit
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it

Look be consistent First you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an  bit program as some sort of error 
So I post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that 
So you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was I have misunderstood
etc
Now you are saying

We discussed about errors in XV  which shows images only as bit

If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
discussion a lot easier



So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV  that is there
must be a colormap anyway The problems you present are exist anyway
and I didn't tried to solve them at all because I would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place

Eh Sorry I don't understand what you are saying here I am aware that English is
not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this
paragraph defeats me

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to bit image
as I presented There's no need make tricks from bitquantized image
back to  bit image

Yes as I originally said global changes are easily possible

But this statement contradicts what you said earlier 

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the bit image



How would you suggest doing colour editing on a  bit file How
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated

Ok you're writing about situation that user want edit images as bit
and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way
jumps off the discussion a bit

No I don't think so actually 

You were talking about loading a  bit image into xv by quantising
manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these
changes to the  bit file when you exit xv Xv lets you edit individual
colours Where is this sudden jumping off the topic

My solution doesn't work because there's no colormap withing real bit
image 

Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a  bit file

 you see user see bit image going back to bit is silly

I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean

About changing individual colors in bitquantizedrasterized image
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image


What are you saying


XV allows this feature but I don't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images

Ah now we see thew problem First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 
bit previews of  bit images Then I point out problems with this Now you are
saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem


Moreover XV is not a paint program you can only make those global
changes 

Not sure what you are saying here Certainly one can make local changes

In full bit XV changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job
If person have bit screen there's need for tricks to get the
original bit image modified Because user don't see full bit
image there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if
image is rasterized To select indiavidual color there could be x
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area 
selecting individual color is possible from that

Yes that is one possible approach I would find a program that took such an
approach clumsy however

Ok I don't have thought very much bit painting programs never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such Not to mention
bit painting program in bit screen

Well here we agree  you have not thought it through very much You don't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next OK we all have off days  perhaps you should step back and think this one
through

Yes again What is was wrong with xv

It saved bitquantizedrasterized images as bit jpegs jpeg is not
designed for that

As I said in the last post JPEG is a compression algorithm It is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression I fail to see what
the problem is You have not proposed any workable alternatives

Also human expect that bit will be saved as bit image 

Speak for yourself You are the only person I have met or spoken to who
having quantised a  bit image down to  bits expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the  bit image palette

Perhaps that is why you yused the singular

say
person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is
expected that the image still is the same 

Look next time you import a  bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel  it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the  bit
image XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original  bit
file You are the only person who claims this is confusing

So XV were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work  design error

Is a design error the same as a bug 

Read my lips XV is a program for viewing and modifying  bit images It lets
you import other images It shows I would say a good deal of thought about the
human interface And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
was designed for It makes no false claims

I have heard XV were designed first for bit imagesfiles but
it were not good idea to take full bit images without making
major change to the original design

If you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them So 
far you have not done so

So even all screen images are bit the processed images and saved
images could have been bit very easily instead of bit

Argh After all this a comment like that Very easily' OK go ahead and code it
if it is so easy

Or alternatively look up the terms import' and 'nonreversible transformation'

Before anybody will make a note yes I may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however
even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn't solve the problem
Americans the lift is just an example 

I think this is a bit of an exageration

What you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in
the states   and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up Everyone else
had no problem Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer

Well my text may be a bit hard reading 

you bet

hopefully you suggeeded to
read it

Mostly Leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly
thinking as you yourself admit which is the same in any language Go think
some more

   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program
   an INTERACTIVE FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL
   Besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc
   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs
   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image

   The following is the relevant sections from the man page 
   

PreRelease of May                                        BITL

NAME
   bit  Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations

DESCRIPTION
  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on
  Silicon Graphics GL As a full color program bit handles images of both
  bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner

  As an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their
  original type bits or color index in any order and in any of the
  many builtin styles of display You can walk up and down the list using
  mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you The
  SlideShow  With the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed
  in full without being limited by the window or screen size

  As an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and
  processing tasks accurately and efficiently It keeps information loss
  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing
  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type
  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion andor quantization of
  input images You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into
  another  In addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple
  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with
  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take
  advantage of the higher printer resolutions eg PostScript

  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing
  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence
  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be
  accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image
  will be read back and displayed immediately Convolution using exter
  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically
  giving great flexibility in processing an image

FEATURES

  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a
  continuous progress report and once the processing is complete 
  the processed image will be displayed

  Current features include

  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of antialiasing
    and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color

  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x andor ydirections with
    the option of subpixel sampling

  o Renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an
    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving
    the text and raster separately such as into a PostScript file to
    take advantage of a higher printer resolution Besides normal text
    strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as
    in TeX eg alphasmallbeta produces Greek alphabet alpha
    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta

  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image

  o Performs arbitrary to pixel transformation  The transformation
    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary
    forms Further the transformation can be applied to RGB channels
    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of
    it Many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished
    rather easily by to transformation in combination with the avai
    lability of graphical histograms of the image

  o Places simple geometric figures SGFs eg arrows circles trian
    gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at
    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some
    user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering
    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately eg
    PostScript file All SGFs can be scaled in x and ydirections
    independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a
    circle

  o Performs edge detection In combination with image histograms and 
    to transformation very accurate result can be obtained

  o Performs histogram equalization

  o Performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of
    arbitrary order

  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image

  o Cuts and pastes across images

  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount

  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause
    interval between images SlideShow

  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels
    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities
    or as an intensity vs distance plot

  o Performs image type conversions

  o Converts image formats

  o Smoothes an image Special convolution

  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image
    back and display it

  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values

  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the
    resulting power spectra

  o Spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this prerelease

 SUPPORTED FORMATS
      o  IRIS RGB native to SGI IRIS
      o  JPEGJFIF format
      o  CompuServ GIF
      o  PNMPortable Any Map including PPM PGM and PBM
      o  XBM X Window Bitmap
      o  TIFF
      o  PostScriptWrite only

Hardware requirements

   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode including indigoes

Where to get it

   anonymous ftp to montesvecuhedu   pubbitbitxxxtarZ
   where xxx is the version number Current version is 

   Read srcReadme for installation instructions after unpacking

Acknowledgement

   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 
   FORMS library developed by Mark Overmars is used for GUI
   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release


  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate
  images The builtin editing features will satisfy most of
  your editing needs In addition the external filter and dynamical
  kernel will utilize any program you already have So try it
  and you will like it
  
  As always any commentsbug reports are welcome

would be plenty for me

Sorry I'm not a rayshade user  but hey it looks like this group could
use some traffic  My guess is that metallic isn't a color in the RGB
sense  Rather it's a matter of how the surface reflects light  I'm not
sure what property metallic materials have that makes them recognizable
as such but I'm pretty sure any color material can look metallic

Thanks in advance

Howdy  I think you would be interested in InfiniD  for the Mac  There
is no DOS or Windows version  It's quite an amazing program

Some of the features

  Bevel Text
  Timeline based animation sequencer
  Realtime bounding box preview
  Object linking
  Phong Shading
  Ray Tracing
  Bounding Box shading
  Wireframe shading
  Ghourad shading
  Flat shading
  Antialiasing none low medium high
  Environment maps
  Quicktime support wrap a QT movie around an object
  Procedural surfaces
  Composed surfaces for layering surfaces
  Alpha channel support
  Import EPS DXF and Swivel D files
  Export DXF and Swivel D files
  Spline based animation
  Animation assistant for creating smooth movements and other stuff
  Object morphing surfaces and bevels morph too

 And lots more that I can't remember right now

Anyway it's not as expensive as some of the other animationrendering
packages  I think you can get it for around  from MacWarehouse
They also have educational discounts

Well hope that helps a bit

See ya

And no SIGGRAPH  has not skipped town  we're preparing the best
SIGGRAPH conference yet

Speaking of SIGGRAPH I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration
for SIGGRAPH and reupping of membership in the ACM last night and was I ever
grossed out  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery

For example

	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from  last year to  this year for the same
	thing a  increase  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the
	annual conference could reduce this to  by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite
	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional  or so for the
	proceedings and the art show catalog essentially

	TOPLAS went up  in cost way outstripping the current inflation rate

	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same but whereas before SIGCHI
	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings
	these are now an extra cost option  Bundling that back into the basic
	rate equivalent services have gone up  in cost

	SIGOIS membership cost has up  but they've also split out the
	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to
	be included with membership  Adding that cost back in means this SIG
	also has doubled its membership fee

What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services and tried to make it
sound like they were offering NEW services  But with the exception of a couple
like SIGGRAPH all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they don't look so big  But their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying  more than last year for a 
increase in services measured by cost not by value and curiously a 
inflation rate on the publications I got last year

Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am

As far as I know it's okay  You'd have to read the licence agreement that
comes with the package to be sure

I heard a friend who just return from NAB from Las Vegas confirm
that RealSoft will be releasing a Windows version of REALD 
this summer  He was told that the rendering speed on the DX isn't
as fast as A  However he was also told that they are switching
from Microsoft C to Watcom to gain more speed  For people who is
looking for a powerful D animation software for PC  The wait
shouldn't be too long  Real D  is absolutely the most powerful and
flexible D package out there that sells for less than 

ps I heard a Indigo version is also under development

Does anyone know if the source is available to create FLI
or FLC animations I would ideally like DLL's for Windows
but would settle for C source  I've heard they might be 
available on Amiga forums somewhere  The libraries
currently distributed by Autodesk AAWIN AAPLAY do NOT
have FLI creation capability only playback

Any pointers would be appreciated thanks

local bus video card

The only hitch is that I need one that will allow me to do the fastest
anims or flics from ram I have megs of ram in meg simms

I am using DStudio from Autodesk and Imagine from Impulse
They both write out in the FLC format

So does anyone know what would be the best card for showing fast anims
from ram ie like the orchid Diamond Stealth Viper ATIetc

any help would be appreciated  I am trying to circumvent the single

I just sent a mail to Turgut Kalfaoglu sp the maintainer of the list

  A great many computer programmers read Dr Dobb's Journal  In a recent
issue there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read  It
said

  There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer
industry  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 's

  Where has the hacker ethic gone  Not the cracker ethic which is something
entirely different and bad but the hacker ethic which tells us to value the
free distribution of information and yield to the handson imperative  Why is
it that people and corporations like Bill Gates IBM and Intel are able to
have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry  Why is it that if a person
like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks
crannies and idiosyncrasies of a computer system they are not given any
useful information by those who know just a badmouthing or are completely
ignored  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to
make truly innovative products  I ask those of you who call yourselves
hackers why is this  And further how can you let it go on  It is a fact
that the computer industry has changed the world and shall continue to do so
for a long time to come  It has allowed the propagation of information in a
volume unheard of even twenty years ago and has made this world even smaller
than it was before  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the
corporations are allowed to have their way perpetuating more drivel like the
 Windows and the IBM product line on the computerusing public  

  That is not to say I am against business per se people who profit off of
innovative intelligent creative designs do not bother me  In fact I applaud
it that is the American way  But those who manage to sell kludgy uncreative
systems to the public and profit off of them are the ones who are the
problem  And unfortunately because they have enough money to make up for
blunt stupidity they can keep doing it for a very long time

  I put it to you thus  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone  If it still exists
where  And if it DOES exist why are those who call themselves hackers
allowing this to perpetuate itself  Why are they not creating new innovative
interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the
computer industry

  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence

I think  months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable  If
you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong but that's a moot

My Toshiba T LCD CGA  died in  months  Replaced under the

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 's in a short space of time They were all around  years old
Some screens went completely as above others were just dodgy

This happened to about  or  out of maybe  They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's no link to the

of AAWIN or AAPLAY by Autodesk but for the creation of these delta

the Large memory model of DOS with Turbo C Ideally I would
like a DLL or Medium model object library but would settle
for anything really  I've seen other Windows apps with
FLIFLC creation did they hack the FLILIB code into submission

Ah now we see thew problem First you want to extend xv to allow
editing of  bit previews of  bit images Then I point out problems
with this Now you are saying there is no problem because you
personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause
the problem
 see previous article on this debate for the rests 

I can see XV agree with my view in cases you don't  even I say
my personal opinion as above it doesn't mean that it is not most
obvious thing
Please if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument
please do read them  you have not saw them at all you just
refered to text from which I wrote 'something'  and you make
hard decisions from that without reading what exactly I have written

It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
and don't understand include previously written material with the new
sentences to give them meaning You seem to be one such

You also start replying to my articles even you don't understand what
is going on you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
wrong with XV  even I posted them within the article you did reply
to Believe me it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know
that you have not read my article carefully in the first place

XV and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the
places you didn't I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I
wrote We can blame my writing skills in English for that or

Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV gives

Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain
surfaces for exactly the purpose you require importing into D
modelling packages Be warned the data content is high and brings
many packages to their knees We use it primarily for MicroStation
but it exports DXF as well as other formats so you should be OK

Within a few months I'll be looking for a job in d computer graphics
software  I'm in need of info on companies that do it  There's nothing
in any of the FAQ's for this group and nothing at siggraphorg at least
I couldn't find anything  The last Computer Graphics Career Handbook was
dated  had info on  companies but nothing specific on any of them

Can people please direct me towards more current and detailed sources of
information  I'll post a summary of sources if there's interest

Also could you please email me our news server is on the fritz

I also would like code or algorithms to do this

In fact I am interested in sources for code andor algorithms that
convert D graphical objects into other D graphical objects that
will render into the same image ie Bezier curves to B splines

Does anyone out there have any JPEG decompression code in pretty much any

some good code I will appreciate it a lot  Thanks

The problem is that the process is inherently complicated  The IJG's code is
pretty good if you ask me and I have watched it go through many many cycles of
revision

Try getting a good book on the subject that will explain the algorithms

I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF JFIF file
format I was looking thru it but I didn't get the idea how
to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
whole image

How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF

How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
picture

I wrote a small tool lsgif for GIF that returns the
filesize picture size and color resolution by analizing
the header chunks The output looks like this

    blagif                                  x   C

I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a
similar tool for JFIF with an output like this

     blajpg                                  x      C

Please respond by email because I don't read this news
group very often I'll post a summary if it is useful

Thanx in advance

Announcing xmgr ACEgr Motif version v

Xmgr is a fullfeatured XYplotting tool for UNIX workstations 
using X or OpenWindows There is an XView version called xvgr for
Suns Collectively these  tools are known as ACEgr Compiling 
xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version  and XR  xmgr will 
not compile under XRMotif x  XRMotif  should work 
fine but I've not been able to test this

For a summary of xmgr's capabilities get the file BLURB from
either site mentioned below

Available via anonymous ftp to either

ftpccalmrogieduCCALMRpubacegrxmgrtarZ

or

exportlcsmiteducontribacegrxmgrtarZ

Please remember to set the transfer type to binary

I am not able to Email xmgr but there are services provided 
by various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail You might try 
sending mail to ftpmaildecwrldeccom as follows

Subject hit return Bodyofletter help return quit

I've not tried this but it should give you instructions on how 
to use this service

 has been compiled and tested on

 IBM RS  AIX  XRMotif 
 DECstation  Ultrix a XRMotif 
 SGI Indigo  Irix  XRMotif 
 Sun SPARC   SunOS  XRMotif 
 HP       HPUX  XRMotif 

Compiling with gcc should be no problem but use settings 
appropriate for KR C

Of interest

In light of recent announcements COSE I'm suspending further 
development of the XView version For those without Motif on 
SUNs I'll provide a compiled binary eventually

I've begun rewriting ACEgr in C the initial target is
MSWindows

Improvementsfixes from  are

  The explicit placement of items in popups has been replaced
	with manager widgets The previous method led to problems
	on some servers all widgets in a popup would get scrunched
	into the upper left corner

  Many set operations can now be done in the FileStatus popup

  The PostScript driver should do a better job of producing
	EPSF'able output

A few things remain to do I could use some ideashelp on these

 Replace the Hershey fonts used for onscreen text with the
	xvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson
	The problem here is how to include support for this in the
	user interface

 Add support for Adobe Font Metrics I could use some PD or freely
	distributable routines for this

 Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver Presently
	the only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF into
	FrameMaker Need PS routines for pattern fills

 Add support for HDFNetCDF I'm interested in your opinion on
	how one would write a generic reader for these file formats

Q  What is Gopher

A  The Internet Gopher clientserver provides a distributed
     information delivery system around which a worldcampuswide
     information system CWIS can readily be constructed   While
     providing a delivery vehicle for local information  Gopher
     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers
     throughout the world 


Q  Where can I get Gopher software

A  via anonymous ftp to boomboxmicroumnedu  Look in the directory
     pubgopher


Q  What do I need to access Gopher

A  You will need a gopher client program that runs on your local PC
     or workstation

     There are clients for the following systems  The directory
     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
     ftp site boomboxmicroumnedu  in the directory
     pubgopher

      MVSXA                  pubgophermvs

     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others the
     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list  

      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client The Gopher Book

         lennonitnmedumichedudosgopher

      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX
         jobacsohiostateeduXGOPHERCLIENTSHARE


      Note these Macintosh clients require MacTCP

     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
     itself  Put the following on a gopher server

       Type
       Hostboomboxmicroumnedu
       Port
       Path
       NameGopher Software Distribution

 
     Or point your gopher client at boomboxmicroumnedu port  and
     look in the gopher directory


     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available
     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine
     consultantmicroumnedu  See Q for more
     information about this  It is recommended that you run the client
     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites  A
     client uses the custom features of the local machine mouse
     scroll bars etc  A local client is also faster


Q  Where are there publicly available logins ie places to telnet to
     in order to get a taste of gopher for Gopher

A  Here is a short list use the site closest to you to minimize
     network lag

     Telnet Public Logins

     Hostname                  IP              Login   Area

     ecnetec		                gopher  Ecuador
     gannccgojp                  gopher  Japan


     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of
     logging into the public login sites  A client uses the
     custom features of the local machine mouse scroll bars etc
     and gives faster response  Furthermore many of the basic features
     of clients  saving a file to your hard drive printing a file
     to a local printer viewing images retrieving files from ftp
     sites etc are not available by the telnet logins




Q  Who Develops Gopher Software

A  Gopher was originally developed in April  by the University
     of Minnesota Microcomputer Workstation Networks Center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions  

     It has since grown into a fullfledged World Wide Information
     System used by a large number of sites in the world

     Many people have contributed to the project too numerous to
     count 

     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via email at gopherboomboxmicroumnedu or via paper mail
   
      Internet Gopher Developers
       Union St SE 
      Minneapolis MN   USA

     Or via FAX at
 
        


Q What is the relationship between Gopher and WAIS WWW ftp

A Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems
     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to 
     
        Search local WAIS indices
        Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients
        Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients
        Be queried by WWW World Wide Web clients either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying


Q Are papers or articles describing Gopher available

A Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in

Q What is veronica

A veronica  Very Easy RodentOriented Netwide Index to 
     Computerized Archives

     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopherserver menu titles
     in the entire gopher web  As archie is to ftp archives veronica 
     is to gopherspace  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher
     items each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source
     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client it is easy
     to use and gives access to all types of data supported by the
     gopher protocol

     To try veronica select it from the Other Gophers menu on 
     Minnesota's gopher server or point your gopher at

 Is that a reasonable life

I think  months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable  If
you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong but that's a moot
point perhaps

Maybe I've had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since  which is
still used daily and the screen on that is fine The only problem it
has and ever has had is the arm of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it
round a bit But other than that it's been perfect So what's that
about um  months

Perhaphs what Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are now is the result of the

What a computer hacker is and does will change as long as the definition
of the word computer continues to change


Or perhaps you write a freely available GPLed unix for commonly
available computer platforms ii machines and become a catalyst
for a major netwide project which produces a better unixlike os than
many commercial counterparts see composlinux for details  Or maybe
you found a Legue for Programming Freedom to fight restrictive litigation
and software patenting practices thereby protecting the creative freedom
so vital to continuing progress in our field  Or maybe you start up
a gnu project and produce by far and away the best cc compiler
for unix there is not to mention other valuable utilities

Some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their
ideals  As for Bill Gates after pawning of grossly inferior software
onto the PC market for ten years if he ever was a hacker he deserves
to have his name eradicated from the Annals of Computer Hackery

As for me I like running linuxXcountless other packages without
paying a dime  On the other hand I have no problem purchasing motif
or other good software as long as Microsoft hasn't fouled it with their
inept input

My  cents worth flames will be patiently ignored

   I put it to you thus  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone  If it still exists
 where  And if it DOES exist why are those who call themselves hackers
 allowing this to perpetuate itself  Why are they not creating new innovative
 interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the
 computer industry

Since this was posted on compai I assume there is an AI angle to this  Hacking is
what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else eg
thesis research  write up getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly
etc  Noone gets much glory for hacking and noone gets any money out of it
Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time  resources that
not many people can or want to afford  particularly during a recession

In addition over the last  years I think there has been a deemphasis on producing
running programs in AI research and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
problemsolving  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs
At a conference a year or two ago Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should
'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas 
and I have to say I'm inclined to agree

I don't claim to be a superhacker but I don't think that invalidates my remarks
And I'm sure this isn't the whole story

companies in the midwest that make scans and the numbers of companies that
make the sanners ie Cyberware Does anyone have an idea of how much a
single scan costs and the best format to save it in I am not sure on what
software platform I will be using it in probably either Softimage or
Wavefront So I think a spline based format would be best Please forward the
numbers to me personally as I am having problems accessing USENET lately

Where did the hacker ethic go

We hackers of the 's and ' are now comfortably employed
and supporting families  The next generation takes
the radical lead now  Don't look for radicalism among us
old ones we're gone

Perhaps all of us hackers have become ICK PROFESSIONALS  I have noticed
my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals
It is rather distasteful  It occurs when a series of things happen

    one's ego outgrows one's talentknowledge
    one's financial situation takes precedence
    A change in priorities esp family possibly leading to 
    the hacker's attitude makes the shift from fun to work
    one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for the hobby

or the biggest killer IMO

    one's dreams are sadly shattered on the hard rocks of society's
      version of reality  Without the dream the motivation dies without
      the motivation the effort seems useless

Another set of problems stems from our children  While most of us remember
when there were several completely different computer systems our children
are growing up with just a few choices MSDOSMacAmiga and do not enjoy
the diversity we did  I remember the great computer fallout of the early
eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems
that were now dead  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely
divergent paradigms  That period forced hackers to continually learn new
systems in the attempt to keep up  Not to mention that if a program was
needed we were forced in most situations to write it ourselves as a
commercial offering was just not available  Now our children are being
taught the user mentality  As the number of us oldtimers dwindle we are
not being replaced by the next generation

Actually IFF is a format standard  It is not a picture file format sound
file format but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard  The
IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM or just ILBM
The only D IFF specification I know of is TDDD which is used by Imagine and
it's predecessor Turbo Silver   It is possible that some of the other Amiga
packages use another IFF spec but I don't know of any  Lightwave will load
TDDD FORM's I believe

  What is JPEG

JPEG pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard  JPEG is designed for compressing either
fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes
It does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line
drawings

JPEG does not handle blackandwhite bitperpixel images nor does it
handle motion picture compression  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees named JBIG and MPEG
respectively

JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of lightanddark  Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans  If you plan to machineanalyze your images the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are
invisible to the eye

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality  You can make extremely small
files if you don't mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image
archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  Conversely if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression


  Why use JPEG

There are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store
bitperpixel color data instead of bitperpixel data

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images  Being able to compress a
 Mbyte fullcolor file down to  Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time  If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the
size ratio is more like four to one  More details below

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  Even
with a JPEGcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format GIF for instance  Thus using
JPEG is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information  bitspixel
 million colors instead of  or less  or fewer colors  If you have
only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you  Within a couple of years though bit GIF will look as obsolete as
blackandwhite MacPaint format does today  Furthermore for reasons detailed
in section  JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard


  When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF

JPEG is not going to displace GIF entirely for some types of images
GIF is superior in image quality file size or both  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to

As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing fullcolor or
grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and
similar material  JPEG is superior even if you don't have bit display
hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do  See section  for details

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors
such as cartoons and line drawings  In particular large areas of pixels
that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form
In particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they
should be avoided in JPEG files

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels
adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  Again this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files borders overlaid text etc  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high
If you have a GIF with a lot of smallsize overlaid text don't JPEG it

Computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it
The same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such

Plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to JPEG
You need at least about  gray levels before JPEG is useful for grayscale
images  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for grayscale images
of up to  levels while JPEG is not

If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG  You will lose a little image quality if you do
Section  which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only
applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  If you start from
a GIF you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information JPEG
can only make things worse  However the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section  for hints  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not
convert well


  How well does JPEG compress images

Pretty darn well  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy a x fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  The first three
files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section B

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

shipppm	  Original file in PPM format no compression  bits
			 or  bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead
shipppmZ	   PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot you'll note
			 Other textoriented compressors give similar results
shipgif	   Converted to GIF with ppmquant fs   ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info GIF saves  bitspixel not   See sec 

shipjpg	   cjpeg Q     highest useful quality setting
			 This is indistinguishable from the bit original
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q     default setting
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original even with both onscreen at once
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q 
			 This has slight defects if you know what to look
			 for you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q 
			 JPEG's characteristic blockiness becomes apparent
			 at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some
			 Still I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this
shipjpgo	     cjpeg Q  optimize  optimize cuts table overhead
			 Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes  Note that this file is TINY
			 the compression ratio from the original is  

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality the Q  file is every bit as good as the
GIF better if you have a fullcolor display  This seems to be a typical
ratio for realworld scenes


  What are good quality settings for JPEG

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings  Quality  does NOT mean keep  of the
information as some have claimed  The quality scale is purely arbitrary
it's not a percentage of anything

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another but here are some rules of thumb

The default quality setting Q  is very often the best choice  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image  Try Q  first if you see defects then go up  Except for
experimental purposes never go above Q  saying Q  will produce a
file two or three times as large as Q  but of hardly any better quality

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to
go down to Q  without objectionable degradation  On the other hand you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG
The default Q  is about right for compressing bit images but Q  to
 is usually better for converting GIFs see section  for more info

If you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are
prepared to tolerate large defects a Q setting in the range of  to  is
about right  Q  or so may be amusing as op art

Note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section B and to many programs based on it  Other
JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different
quality scale  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale just
highmediumlowstyle choices


  Where can I get JPEG software

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP
If you don't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources
If you don't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the
same article  That article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can
get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with
send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  The Anonymous FTP
List FAQ may also be helpful  it's usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in
the newsanswers archive

NOTE this list changes constantly  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the newsanswers archive


A  If you are looking for canned software viewers etc

The first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one
kind of system  If you don't see what you want for your machine check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet but some commercial programs are listed too

X Windows

XV shareware  is an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other
image formats  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations  It's available for FTP from exportlcsmitedu 
file contribxvtarZ  Version  is a major upgrade with support
for bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge stick with version  also available from export  Note that
version  is not a good choice if you have a bit display you'll get
only bit color nor for converting bit images to JPEG  But  works
fine for converting GIF and other bit images to JPEG  CAUTION there is a
glitch in version  be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox
when saving a JPEG file or the file will be blurry

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package
also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribImageMagicktarZ
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  The
ImageMagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped
displays it does better though slower color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software

Both of the above are large complex packages  If you just want a simple
image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release   xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu
file contribxloadimagetarZ  xli is a variant version of xloadimage
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original
The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v
decoder while xloadimage  is using a hackedover v  The next
xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from
exportlcsmitedu file contribxlitarZ  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with bit displays


MSDOS

This covers plain DOS for Windows or OS programs see the next headings

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files
The current version  is available by FTP from suneeuwaterlooca
 file pubjpegviewersdvpegzip  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either  or  machines  The user interface is
not flashy but it's functional

Another freeware JPEGGIFTGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview  The
current version  is available from Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE
below file msdosgraphicshvzip  Hiview requires a  or better CPU
and a VCPIcompatible memory manager QEMM and MAX work Windows and
OS do not  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen  For larger images it scales the image down to fit
on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do
You may or may not prefer this approach but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably  Note installation is a
bit tricky read the directions carefully

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS   This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives  Its user interface is
also much spiffierlooking although personally I find it harder to use 
more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware  For images larger than
screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both
are faster than Hiview  The current version is  available from
Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsdcviewzip
Requires a VESA graphics driver if you don't have one look in vesadrvzip
or vesatsrzip from the same directory  Many recent PCs have a builtin
VESA driver so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing

A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around
the net for a while but I don't know any stable archive location for it
The current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel archives at that time

The wellknown GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW supports JPEG in its latest
revision a  However CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good
it's slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is
poor except on hicolor displays  Too bad  it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW  Shareware   Available from Simtel and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgifcshwazip

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine  If you can't get any
of them to work you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer  If you
have hicolor hardware don't use GIF as the intermediate format try to
find a TARGAcapable viewer instead  VPIC is reputed to do the right
thing with hicolor displays

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel
and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsjpegzip or
jpegzip if you have a  and extended memory  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section B they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats

Handmade Software offers free JPEGGIF conversion tools GIFJPGJPGGIF
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format in
particular you can't get bit color output from a JPEG  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Since HSIformat
files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability  Version
 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  Get it from
Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsgifjpgzip
NOTE do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is
not readable on nonPC platforms

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package Image Alchemy  This will translate JPEG files both JFIF and HSI
formats to and from many other image formats  It can also display images
A demo version of Image Alchemy version  is available from Simtel and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsalchzip

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL The Internet's key archive site for PCrelated programs
is Simtel full name wsmrsimtelarmymil   Simtel
runs a nonUnix system with weird directory names where this document
refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at Simtel that really means
pdmsdosgraphics  If you are not physically on MILnet you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the Simtel archives
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  A popular USA
mirror site is oakoaklandedu  which keeps Simtel files
in eg pubmsdosgraphics  If you have no FTP capability you can
retrieve files from Simtel by email see informational postings in
comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  If you are outside the USA
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel mirror is

Microsoft Windows

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images
Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware
due to Windows' system overhead  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window

The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast  Version 
is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip
Requires Windows  and ormorecolors mode  This is a nofrills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway at least for previewing

JView is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format but it can't create new JPEG
files and it doesn't view GIFs  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it's
an excellent basic viewer  The current version  is available from
ftpcicaindianaedu  file pubpcwindesktopjviewzip
Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites
including wuarchivewustledu

WinJPEG shareware  displays JPEGGIFTargaTIFF and BMP image files
it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter
It has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and
slideshow  The current version is  available from Simtel and mirror
sites see NOTE above file msdoswindowswinjpzip  This is a slow
compatible version if you register you'll get the only version
which is roughly  faster

ColorView is another shareware entry   This was an early and promising
contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG  If you want to try it anyway the
current version is  available from ftpcicaindianaedu file
pubpcwindesktopcviewzip  I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS

DVPEG see DOS heading also works under Windows but only in fullscreen
mode not in a window

OS

The following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu 
Note check pubuploads for more recent versions  the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories
pubosxgraphicsjpegvzip

    as the above programs  Strong bit display support  Shareware 

Macintosh

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation which is part of
the QuickTime system extension so you need to have QuickTime installed
To use QuickTime you need a  or better CPU and you need to be running
System  or later  If you're running System  you must also install
the bit QuickDraw extension this is builtin on System   You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx
As of  this file contains QuickTime  which is better than QT 
in several ways  With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file  However
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format PICTJPEG is
not the same as the Usenetstandard JFIF JPEG format  See section  for
details  If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format

The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format PICTJPEG format or GIF format  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats  The current version  is a big
improvement over prior versions  Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu
 file infomacappjpegviewhqx  Requires System  and
QuickTime  On bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers in fact it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over x pixels on a
typical MB Mac  Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers  You can zoom in on any desired portion though  Some people
like this behavior some don't  Overall JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out

GIFConverter a shareware  image viewerconverter supports JFIF and
PICTJPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats  The latest
version is   Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacartgifgifconverterhqx  Requires System  or later
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEGGIF viewer but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images  Also the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images without QuickTime so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime  But it's faster with QuickTime
Note If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version

JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is
available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconverthqx
This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v a JPEGGIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code  If you are using this
program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and
GIF format and can convert between these formats  You can get PictPixie
from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqtstuffpictpixiehqx
Requires QuickTime  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  Worse PictPixie is an
unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix  There is an old version of PictPixie called
PICTCompressor floating around the net  If you have this you should trash
it as it's even buggier  Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleanedup descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewerconverter
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but
it will run without System  or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on
older systems  It does need bit QuickDraw so really old machines can't
use it  You can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacapppicturedecompresshqx  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it

If your machine is too old to run bit QuickDraw a Mac Plus for instance
GIFConverter is your only choice for singleprogram JPEG viewing  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not
all can deal with the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Adobe Photoshop version
 or later can read and write JFIFformat JPEG files use the JPEG
plugin from the Acquire menu  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it

Amiga

Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amigaphysikunizhch   There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one  In the USA a good
choice is wuarchivewustledu look under mirrorsamigaphysikunizhch

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewerconverter as well as being a
general image manipulation tool  It's cheap shareware  and can read
several formats besides JPEG  The current version is   A demo version
is available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxedithamlabdlha  The demo version will crop images larger
than x but it is otherwise fully functional

Rend shareware  is an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM
and GIF images  The program can be used to create animations even
capturing frames onthefly from rendering packages like Lightwave  The
current version is  available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror
sites file amigaosgfxrendlha  Note although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS  programs the program will also run under
AmigaDOS   or 

Viewtek is a free JPEGILBMGIFANIM viewer  The current version is 
available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxshowViewTeklha

If you're willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend
and Viewtek  These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and
ImageFX an impressive bit image capture conversion editing painting
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products  Art Department Professional ADPro
from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas  ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another
wellregarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites in directory amigagfxconv file
AmigaJPEGVlha  These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPMGIFTarga formats

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quickanddirty JPEG programs many
based on an ancient betatest version of the free IJG JPEG software thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its diskofthemonth without
so much as notifying the authors  Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG
VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of  In my opinion
anything older than IJG version  March  is not worth the disk space
it's stored on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer

Atari ST

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc
from atariarchiveumichedu file atariGraphicsjpegbinzoo
These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPM GIF Targa formats

For monochrome ST monitors try MGIF which manages to achieve fourlevel
grayscale effect by flickering  Version  reads JPEG files  Available
from atariarchiveumichedu file atariGraphicsmgifbzoo

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEGcapable viewers for
Ataris but surely there must be some by now  Pointers appreciated

Acorn Archimedes

ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS  version  can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by doubleclicking

Recent versions since  of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG along with about  other image formats  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards the current version is only available by
registering with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink   WJ Enschede
The Netherlands  Price  Dutch guilders about  or  pounds

There's also a commercial product called JPEG which provides JPEG readwrite
functionality and direct JPEG viewing as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs  Contact DT Software FREEPOST
Cambridge UK  Tel  


Portable software for almost any system

If none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in B  You'll also need a viewer program
If your display is  bits or less any GIF viewer will do fine if you have a
display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM bit image files

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings with more popping up every
day  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow  In that case
purchase a hardwareassisted product  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files


B  If you are looking for source code to work with

Free portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group which I lead  A package containing our source code
documentation and some small test files is available from several places
The official archive site for this source code is ftpuunet 
or   Look under directory graphicsjpeg the current release
is jpegsrcvtarZ  This is a compressed TAR file don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with tarZ format you may
prefer ZIP format which you can find at Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE
above file msdosgraphicsjpegsrczip  This file will also be available on
CompuServe in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum GO PICS library  as jpsrczip
If you have no FTP access you can retrieve the source from your nearest
compsourcesmisc archive version  appeared as issues  of volume 
If you don't know how to retrieve compsourcesmisc postings see the FAQ
article How to find sources referred to at the top of section 

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image
files in GIF PBMPLUS PPMPGM Utah RLE and Truevision Targa file formats
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs such as image viewers  The package is highly portable we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays

  What's all this hoopla about color quantization

Most people don't have fullcolor  bit per pixel display hardware
Typical display hardware stores  or fewer bits per pixel so it can display
 or fewer distinct colors at a time  To display a fullcolor image the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors  This process is called color quantization  This is something
of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  We're stuck with
the standard usage though

Clearly color quantization is a lossy process  It turns out that for most
images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings

Since JPEG is a fullcolor format converting a color JPEG image for display
on bitorless hardware requires color quantization  This is true for
all color JPEGs even if you feed a orlesscolor GIF into JPEG what
comes out of the decompressor is not  colors but thousands of colors
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors  Each original color gets smeared
into a group of nearby colors  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image
source  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output

Incidentally because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences  I occasionally see
posted images described as color JPEG  This tells me that the poster
a hasn't read this FAQ and b probably converted the JPEG from a GIF
JPEGs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG

On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
 or fewer colors  A GIF does have a definite number of colors in its
palette and the format doesn't allow more than  palette entries
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don't have to
This is also the disadvantage of GIF you're stuck with the sender's
quantization  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image
Furthermore if the sender didn't use a highquality color quantization
algorithm you're out of luck

For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware  Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in
this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have  With a GIF you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent

It's also worth mentioning that many GIFviewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines  If you view a color GIF on a color EGA
display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations one to create the GIF one to display it but often it's
also due to sloppiness  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed  Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones

Finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthanbit display
hardware already bit hicolor PC displays true bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes etc  For these people GIF is already
obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively
Thus JPEG is an allaround better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machineindependent fashion


  How does JPEG work

The buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine
transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding  This article's long enough already so I'm not going to say more
than that here  For technical information see the compcompression FAQ
This is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files
pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart  If you need help in

  What about lossless JPEG

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the
final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  However this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG
algorithm and it offers much less compression  At present very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial

Saying Q  to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step  With the V free JPEG code you can also say
sample x to turn off subsampling  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image

At this minimumloss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed bitperpixel image  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees
bitforbit accuracy

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than  bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
 or more bits per pixel furthermore JPEG is public domain at least with a
Huffman back end while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents


  Why all the argument about file formats

Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms
it does not refer to a specific image file format  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format this leaves us with a problem  In the absence of
official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
do their own thing and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's

The closest thing we have to a defacto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at CCube Microsystems  They have defined
two JPEGbased file formats
   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a lowend format that transports
    pixels and not much else
   TIFFJPEG aka TIFF  an extension of the Aldus TIFF format  TIFF is
    a highend format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEGrelated products it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now the
TIFF  spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details  Even when TIFFJPEG is well
defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common
denominator TIFFJPEG files may never be as transportable

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh  QuickTime uses a JFIFcompatible format wrapped
inside the Macspecific PICT structure  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are
available to do it see Mac portion of section A  If you have an editor
that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand see section  for details

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs GIFJPGJPGGIF and
Image Alchemy  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format  By default though they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI  This format is NOT readable by any nonHSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings  Use the j switch to get JFIF output  This
applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit JFIF
format by default  You still should be careful not to post HSIformat
files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonPC platforms


  How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEGbased format  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file

  A JFIFstandard file will start with the characters hex FF D FF E
    followed by two variable bytes often hex   followed by 'JFIF'

  If you see FF D at the start but not the rest of it you may have a
    raw JPEG file  This is probably decodable asis by JFIF software 
    it's worth a try anyway

  HSI files start with 'hsi'  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they
    won't decompress properly with nonHSI programs

  A Macintosh PICT file if JPEGcompressed will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header scan for 'JFIF'  Strip off
    everything before the FF D and you should be able to read it

  Anything else it's a proprietary format or not JPEG at all  If you are
    lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream look for FF D
    try stripping off everything before that

In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	begin line
	MCX 

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	begin line
	M'I 

If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading nonJFIF files


  What about arithmetic coding

The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output
of compressed data either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed
The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file  On typical images arithmetic coding
produces a file  or  percent smaller than Huffman coding  All the
filesize numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding

Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi
Thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses
from these companies  The fair use doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best

At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles  In particular arithmetic coding should not
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future  Stay tuned for further details


  Does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression

It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could
decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE  In general recompressing an altered
image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an
identical JPEG file  Even this is not true at least not with the current
free JPEG software  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error  If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration
output  It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change
One of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it

In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original
quality setting would introduce no further loss  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation
If you're wondering why it's because the pixelblock boundaries move
If you cropped off only multiples of  pixels you might be safe but
that's a mighty limited capability

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps  Use a lossless format
PPM RLE TIFF etc while working on the image then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away  Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot
of compressiondecompression time this way 


  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG

As stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG  If you can obtain the original
fullcolor data the GIF was made from it's far better to make a JPEG from
that  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to
make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF
that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in
section  in particular cartoontype GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be larger than the GIF  So check the sizes too

Experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under  Kbytes  Also don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from fullcolor originals  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough
JPEG files would be ie shoot for  or rd the size of the GIF file
not th as suggested in earlier comparisons

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor
border around a GIF image  While useless this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files  It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing  If you are on an X Windows
system XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this

cjpeg's default Q setting of  is appropriate for fullcolor input but
for GIF inputs Q settings of  to  often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation  If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher
Q setting may not be necessary

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool
your eye into seeing more than the  colors that GIF can actually store
If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  The
trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like highspatialfrequency
color noise and JPEG can't compress noise very well  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image if you had it
To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image
than you'd get without smoothing

With the V free JPEG software or products based on it a simple smoothing
capability is built in  Try smooth  or so when converting GIFs
Values of  to  seem to work well for highquality GIFs  Heavyhanded
dithering may require larger smoothing factors  If you can see regular
finescale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong
smoothing is definitely called for  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image which you don't want  If you are an image processing
wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package  However cjpeg's builtin smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol

The upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality  smooth  is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs  But if you really care about the
image you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings

On a more cheerful note perhaps hackerismhacking isn't completely dead

As someone else said take the GNU offerings for example  free redistributable and 
often better than the commercial stuff  Take also the number of papers published
every year in all the fields of computer science  the vast majority of these papers
detail original work of real often exceptional merit  and the authors are sharing
this knowledge

I think the main reason is that in the good old hacker days of the younger
Gates' and Jobs' of the world the computer was not as widespread a
phenomenom as it is now  With the increased popularity of the PC
come a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical
minded and narrowerfocused programmers

Why be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or
programs for accountants  Basically the yuppies caught up and
disciplined the hackers and molded them in their own image

	Intro to ACCESSbus RE the ACCESSbus Software Creator's 
	Contest Announcement

WHAT IS ACCESSbus

ACCESSbus is a new open industry standard for computer 
peripheral connectivity  ACCESSbus is a serial protocol that 
uses simple lowcost IC technology to link multiple devices to 
a single PC port  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or 
keypads locators Mice Trackballs Joysticks printers VR 
gloves digitizers sensors actuators or data transmitters and 
others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC  Applications 
such as CADCAM Data Acquisition Simulation Virtual Reality 
MultiplePlayerSingle PC Games Education and many many more 
can now take advantage of ACCESSbus the technology that puts 
Plug and Play on every PC

The ACCESSbus offers advantages to endusers and developers of 
systems and peripherals  Multiple devices connect to the host 
computer with only one port  Common communication methods for a 
number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 
development  As an open standard ACCESSbus enables cross
platform use of the same device

ACCESSbus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION


ACCESSbus technology is an open specification enabling anyone 
to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 
fee or royalty
ACCESSbus has a bus topology architecture  That is a single 
host can accommodate up to  peripheral devices  ACCESSbus 
data rate is  Kbitssec

ACCESSbus Physical Layer

ACCESSbus is a serial bus architecture based on IC hardware 
protocol with one data line and one clock line
Standard lowcost IC microcontrollers handle bitlevel 
handshaking including automatic arbitration and clock 
synchronization  

ACCESSbus Software Protocols

The ACCESSbus communication protocol is composed of three 
levels IC Protocol Base Protocol and Application Protocol

IC PROTOCOL This simple and efficient protocol defines 
arbitration among contending masters without losing data  IC 
provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 
different clock rates  Bus transactions include addressing 
framing of bits into bytes and byte acknowledgment by the 
receiver  

BASE PROTOCOL Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 
a host computer and multiple peripherals  The host becomes the 
ACCESSbus manager  The Base Protocol defines the format of an 
ACCESSbus message envelope which is an IC bus transaction with 
additional semantics including checksum
Unique features of the Base Protocol are autoaddressing and hot 
plugging  Autoaddressing assigns devices with unique bus 
addresses without the need for setting jumpers or switches  Hot 
plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 
system is running without rebooting

APPLICATION PROTOCOL This is the highest level of the ACCESSbus 
protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 
types of devices  Each type requires a different Application 
Protocol  Three broad device types have been identified 
keyboards locators and text devices

ACCESSbus support on the PC

All three levels of the ACCESSbus protocol are supported on the 
PC  An addon card implements the physical layer and uses the 
base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESSbus devices  
An ACCESSbus Manager  TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows  
 controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with 
the ACCESSbus device drivers  Drivers are available for 
multiple ACCESSbus keyboards locators and printers for DOS and 
Windows   Also available are C language source code examples 
of the interface from applications to the device drivers

Number  of volume  of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 
will receive it in a week or so As you will see the journal is structured
in the following way the editorial first page profiles second page
 biography of an editor in this issue Terry Winograd the edited
part of papers pp  mission and research reports A plan for
knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford pp 
and news and announcements pp  This structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant diverse and interesting bringing your own views
into the discourse
   A great emphasis is given to the socalled editorial page This page
expresses an opinion belief of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics extending into other
concerning disciplines eg cybernetics advanced AI cognitive sciences
mind informationally concerned neural sciences advanced technology 
eg photonics etc I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this
page for Number  I certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors who like to express
their strong directed beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question
   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published
The aim of the profile is twofold to show hisher professional 
achievements interests scientific and philosophical orientation on
one side to narrate hisher life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side This kind of story should
be instructive adequately factically faced contributing to the 
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live
   The edited part edited papers is still critical I would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed eg January April July and October In situation
right now I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues collaborators students etc Some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated
A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities
   Reports of different occasions symposia conferences meetings etc
and particularly on new books papers and interesting events are welcome
You can send these news immediately also by your secretary by email
On the other hand you can send books and other publications annual
reports journals calls for papers etc for reviewing and publishing
in Informatica We in the editorial staff will manage the rest
   Email is functioning satisfactorily so please use it in every respect
You can submit editorial notes profiles reports news and even complete
papers written in standard LaTex format especially formulas We received
several final corrected texts in Number  from different sites US
Russia etc In this way you can compose reports from already typed
texts using your own choice and editing and submit them to the contact
person matjazgamsijssi who is always being on your disposal So
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job

At the end please do not forget we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect The aim of Informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up still unrevealed
and on the way to become significant Please do not apprehend to give
proposals suggestions and certainly contributions via the email
and by other means

Sincerely yours

I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
will do compositing of a series of pictures

What I mean by compositing is say I have a live video clip
digitized panning around a living room and a computergenerated
bird flying around the screen  I want to combine these two series of
pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black I want
the living room picture to show through  Yes I realize I can do this
with a genlock and I do own a genlock but I want to be able to do
manual compositing also  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
a time I assumed I'd have to do that anyway  But being able to
composite a series of frames would be even better

I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform

If you can get the live animation and the computergenerated animation
into AutoDesk Animator FLI or FLC format AutoDesk Animator will do
this for you  It can take one animation make a certain color
clear and overlay it over another animation  I do not have a way
right now to convert AVI or MPG files to animator files  Animator
will also import a series of GIF files to create an animation so if
your video capture stuff can create this is might work

  In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little
programs One is a C program that will perform a morph between
any two points given the amount of frames for the morph And then
it will write the points and the function translate rotate etc out
to a file Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions
and insert them into a pov file at a given line I had hoped this would
let me do simple animation However I have discovered that simply
performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
object but will actually rotate the object about the axis Now I know
an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there 
must be another way around this I had thought perhaps it was because
I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
point and then done the rotation which could cause this behavior However
this occurs on objects that are not translated at all Any help is 
appreciated

      With Kermit supporting Tek emulation for graphics display
   does anyone know of a package that would allow a Tek to display a

Hi

I'd like to know if there is any system CPU  HD array  framebuffer
which can play and record HDTV quality moving picture in realtime

HDTV has about MBframe so recordingplaying moving picture will need
about MBsec bandwidth I'm thinking to treat the raw data not
compressed 

Finding a disk array that can do MBsec will be difficult The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy IBM also sells these They
can attach HiPPI at up to  MBsec  bit For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections Their latest model the
RAID  model Gen  only does  MBsec but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster They are also not
idle must be working on newer products that might be faster and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces They
still marketed the older faster model as of a few mongths ago

Maximum Strategy Inc
 Buckeye Court
Milpitas CA 
salesmaxstratcom

You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times  sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate

Interesting problem Tell us more if you can

If anyone can advise me what kind of product I should look into please
email me I will appriciate it The vendor's email address price of
the products actual performance data of the products any info will 
help me

Thanks in advance

as far as simply mapping your logo or whatever onto a cube or sphere 
it's quite easy Just either copy the GIF you want mapped into the map 
directory or add a map path to the directory where it currently is Then 
go into the materials editor and make a new material with that as the bit 
map voila

     blah blah  talking about hackers you know 


Wow  A new proof for an NPComplete problem you guys in Eurpoe
really got your stuff together


Base Step  deleted too bad

Inductive Step

 But anyway poor golfers bad carpenters or bad surgeons are not
 thieves so your assertion that hackerthief is unsupported by
 your argument IMHO The narrower view that a hacker when
 associated with the computing environment is a dishonest
 expert is not so widespread 

Inductive Hypothesis
 Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody
 perceives you as a thief then this person belongs to a very very
 small group that has some computer knowledge but not enough to know
 the wider and original meaning of the word Of course one can
 always know this and disregard it nonetheless then 
 equate hacker to thief giving substance to Mr Humpty's assertion
 even though in a kind of reverse way

Fodder Step
 Finally a true hacker does not name himselfherself one for this is
 a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large
To me a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who
says Nahh I just know a thing or two people always exagerate 

Filipe Santos english is not my first language so plse be forgetful of my mistakes
Like my mother always said if you can't say something nice
  or was that can't say something right

What is all this gamma stuff anyway 


Although it would be nice to think that an image is an image
there are a lot of complications Not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats gif jpeg tiff etc etc there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated Gamma is one of those things If you've ever downloaded
images from BBS or the net you've probably noticed with most image
viewing programs that some images look ok some look too dark and some
look too light Why is this  you may ask This is gamma correction
or the lack of it

Why do we need gamma correction at all 


Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs cathode
ray tubes  the monitors usually used for viewing images If you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene then you have created a linear or ungammacorrected
image This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light ie adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world
Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a CRT you find that the CRT doesn't give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage The amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this

Lightout  voltage  crtgamma

So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT the image
will look much too dark To fix this up you have to gamma correct
the image first You need to do the opposite of what the CRT
will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get
what you want So you have to do this to your image

gammacorrectedimage  image  crtgamma

For most CRTs the crtgamma is somewhere between  and 

If that is all it is why does it seem so complicated 


The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction
Also not all sources of images give you linear images Video cameras
or video signals in general Because of this a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them and you are 
rarely sure how much If you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light If you display one of those
images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction then it will
look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular CRT

Whose fault is all this 


It is really three things One is all those display programs
out there that don't do gamma correction properly Another is
that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma or
don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is
The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying
gamma's

At least two file formats do the right thing
The Utah Graphics Toolkit rle format has a semistandard way of recording
the gamma of an image The JFIF file standard that uses JPEG compression
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of  ie a
linear image  but not everyone obeys the rules

Some image loaders for instance xli  an X image utility
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view Other image viewers eg xv another X image program and
utilities eg the pbm toolkit provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor

 Note that xv  doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image You need to adjust the R G and B curves to the
appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls Altering the Intensity
in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on H and S This tends
to give a tint to the image 

How can I figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has 


The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgammajpg
provided with xli distribution which is a JFIF jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps The ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using
dithering  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom To find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen and defocus your eyes a
bit

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center

If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma and decrease it if it is below the center The value will usually be
around  

with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the
dispgamma flag and once you've got it right you can set the DISPLAYGAMMA
environment variable in your profile

How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is 


This is the most tricky bit As a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color ie  bit ppm jpg images have a gamma of
 linear although there are many about that have some gamma
correction It seems that the majority of pseudo color images
ie  bit images with color maps  gif etc are gamma corrected
to some degree or other

If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good and gamma corrected images will look too light

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction then linear images will
look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok

Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing


One of the reason that many high quality formats such as
Video use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium This is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic This means images 
could make better use of  bits per color for instance
if they used gamma correction The implication though is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the  bit image to  or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy Since little popular software does this and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level

If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing

I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image

  What is JPEG

JPEG pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard  JPEG is designed for compressing either
fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes
It does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line
drawings

JPEG does not handle blackandwhite bitperpixel images nor does it
handle motion picture compression  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees named JBIG and MPEG
respectively

JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of lightanddark  Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans  If you plan to machineanalyze your images the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are
invisible to the eye

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality  You can make extremely small
files if you don't mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image
archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  Conversely if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression


  Why use JPEG

There are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store
bitperpixel color data instead of bitperpixel data

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images  Being able to compress a
 Mbyte fullcolor file down to  Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time  If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the
size ratio is more like four to one  More details below

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  Even
with a JPEGcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format GIF for instance  Thus using
JPEG is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information  bitspixel
 million colors instead of  or less  or fewer colors  If you have
only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you  Within a couple of years though bit GIF will look as obsolete as
blackandwhite MacPaint format does today  Furthermore for reasons detailed
in section  JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard


  When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF

JPEG is not going to displace GIF entirely for some types of images
GIF is superior in image quality file size or both  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to

As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing fullcolor or
grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and
similar material  JPEG is superior even if you don't have bit display
hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do  See section  for details

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors
such as cartoons and line drawings  In particular large areas of pixels
that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form
In particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they
should be avoided in JPEG files

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels
adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  Again this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files borders overlaid text etc  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high
If you have a GIF with a lot of smallsize overlaid text don't JPEG it

Computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it
The same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such

Plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to JPEG
You need at least about  gray levels before JPEG is useful for grayscale
images  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for grayscale images
of up to  levels while JPEG is not

If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG  You will lose a little image quality if you do
Section  which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only
applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  If you start from
a GIF you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information JPEG
can only make things worse  However the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section  for hints  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not
convert well


  How well does JPEG compress images

Pretty darn well  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy a x fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  The first three
files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section B

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

shipppm	  Original file in PPM format no compression  bits
			 or  bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead
shipppmZ	   PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot you'll note
			 Other textoriented compressors give similar results
shipgif	   Converted to GIF with ppmquant fs   ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info GIF saves  bitspixel not   See sec 

shipjpg	   cjpeg Q     highest useful quality setting
			 This is indistinguishable from the bit original
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q     default setting
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original even with both onscreen at once
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q 
			 This has slight defects if you know what to look
			 for you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups
shipjpg	    cjpeg Q 
			 JPEG's characteristic blockiness becomes apparent
			 at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some
			 Still I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this
shipjpgo	     cjpeg Q  optimize  optimize cuts table overhead
			 Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes  Note that this file is TINY
			 the compression ratio from the original is  

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality the Q  file is every bit as good as the
GIF better if you have a fullcolor display  This seems to be a typical
ratio for realworld scenes


  What are good quality settings for JPEG

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings  Quality  does NOT mean keep  of the
information as some have claimed  The quality scale is purely arbitrary
it's not a percentage of anything

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another but here are some rules of thumb

The default quality setting Q  is very often the best choice  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image  Try Q  first if you see defects then go up  Except for
experimental purposes never go above Q  saying Q  will produce a
file two or three times as large as Q  but of hardly any better quality

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to
go down to Q  without objectionable degradation  On the other hand you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG
The default Q  is about right for compressing bit images but Q  to
 is usually better for converting GIFs see section  for more info

If you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are
prepared to tolerate large defects a Q setting in the range of  to  is
about right  Q  or so may be amusing as op art

Note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section B and to many programs based on it  Other
JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different
quality scale  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale just
highmediumlowstyle choices


  Where can I get JPEG software

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP
If you don't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources
If you don't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the
same article  That article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can
get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with
send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  The Anonymous FTP
List FAQ may also be helpful  it's usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in
the newsanswers archive

NOTE this list changes constantly  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the newsanswers archive


A  If you are looking for canned software viewers etc

The first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one
kind of system  If you don't see what you want for your machine check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet but some commercial programs are listed too

X Windows

XV shareware  is an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other
image formats  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations  It's available for FTP from exportlcsmitedu 
file contribxvtarZ  Version  is a major upgrade with support
for bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge stick with version  also available from export  Note that
version  is not a good choice if you have a bit display you'll get
only bit color nor for converting bit images to JPEG  But  works
fine for converting GIF and other bit images to JPEG  CAUTION there is a
glitch in version  be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox
when saving a JPEG file or the file will be blurry

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package
also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribImageMagicktarZ
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  The
ImageMagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped
displays it does better though slower color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software

Both of the above are large complex packages  If you just want a simple
image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release   xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu
file contribxloadimagetarZ  xli is a variant version of xloadimage
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original
The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v
decoder while xloadimage  is using a hackedover v  The next
xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from
exportlcsmitedu file contribxlitarZ  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with bit displays


MSDOS

This covers plain DOS for Windows or OS programs see the next headings

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files
The current version  is available by FTP from suneeuwaterlooca
 file pubjpegviewersdvpegzip  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either  or  machines  The user interface is
not flashy but it's functional

Another freeware JPEGGIFTGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview  The
current version  is available from Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE
below file msdosgraphicshvzip  Hiview requires a  or better CPU
and a VCPIcompatible memory manager QEMM and MAX work Windows and
OS do not  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen  For larger images it scales the image down to fit
on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do
You may or may not prefer this approach but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably  Note installation is a
bit tricky read the directions carefully

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS   This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives  Its user interface is
also much spiffierlooking although personally I find it harder to use 
more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware  For images larger than
screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both
are faster than Hiview  The current version is  available from
Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsdcviewzip
Requires a VESA graphics driver if you don't have one look in vesadrvzip
or vesatsrzip from the same directory  Many recent PCs have a builtin
VESA driver so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing

A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around
the net for a while but I don't know any stable archive location for it
The current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel archives at that time

The wellknown GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW supports JPEG in its latest
revision a  However CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good
it's slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is
poor except on hicolor displays  Too bad  it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW  Shareware   Available from Simtel and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgifcshwazip

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine  If you can't get any
of them to work you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer  If you
have hicolor hardware don't use GIF as the intermediate format try to
find a TARGAcapable viewer instead  VPIC is reputed to do the right
thing with hicolor displays

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel
and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsjpegzip or
jpegzip if you have a  and extended memory  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section B they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats

Handmade Software offers free JPEGGIF conversion tools GIFJPGJPGGIF
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format in
particular you can't get bit color output from a JPEG  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Since HSIformat
files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability  Version
 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  Get it from
Simtel and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsgifjpgzip
NOTE do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is
not readable on nonPC platforms

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package Image Alchemy  This will translate JPEG files both JFIF and HSI
formats to and from many other image formats  It can also display images
A demo version of Image Alchemy version  is available from Simtel and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsalchzip

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL The Internet's key archive site for PCrelated programs
is Simtel full name wsmrsimtelarmymil   Simtel
runs a nonUnix system with weird directory names where this document
refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at Simtel that really means
pdmsdosgraphics  If you are not physically on MILnet you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the Simtel archives
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  A popular USA
mirror site is oakoaklandedu  which keeps Simtel files
in eg pubmsdosgraphics  If you have no FTP capability you can
retrieve files from Simtel by email see informational postings in
comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  If you are outside the USA
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel mirror is

Microsoft Windows

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images
Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware
due to Windows' system overhead  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window

The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast  Version 
is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip
Requires Windows  and ormorecolors mode  This is a nofrills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway at least for previewing

JView is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format but it can't create new JPEG
files and it doesn't view GIFs  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it's
an excellent basic viewer  The current version  is available from
ftpcicaindianaedu  file pubpcwindesktopjviewzip
Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites
including wuarchivewustledu

WinJPEG shareware  displays JPEGGIFTargaTIFF and BMP image files
it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter
It has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and
slideshow  The current version is  available from Simtel and mirror
sites see NOTE above file msdoswindowswinjpzip  This is a slow
compatible version if you register you'll get the only version
which is roughly  faster

ColorView is another shareware entry   This was an early and promising
contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG  If you want to try it anyway the
current version is  available from ftpcicaindianaedu file
pubpcwindesktopcviewzip  I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS

DVPEG see DOS heading also works under Windows but only in fullscreen
mode not in a window

OS

The following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu

Macintosh

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation which is part of
the QuickTime system extension so you need to have QuickTime installed
To use QuickTime you need a  or better CPU and you need to be running
System  or later  If you're running System  you must also install
the bit QuickDraw extension this is builtin on System   You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx
As of  this file contains QuickTime  which is better than QT 
in several ways  With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file  However
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format PICTJPEG is
not the same as the Usenetstandard JFIF JPEG format  See section  for
details  If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format

The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format PICTJPEG format or GIF format  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats  The current version  is a big
improvement over prior versions  Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu
 file infomacappjpegviewhqx  Requires System  and
QuickTime  On bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers in fact it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over x pixels on a
typical MB Mac  Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers  You can zoom in on any desired portion though  Some people
like this behavior some don't  Overall JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out

GIFConverter a shareware  image viewerconverter supports JFIF and
PICTJPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats  The latest
version is   Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacartgifgifconverterhqx  Requires System  or later
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEGGIF viewer but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images  Also the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images without QuickTime so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime  But it's faster with QuickTime
Note If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version

JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is
available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconverthqx
This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v a JPEGGIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code  If you are using this
program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and
GIF format and can convert between these formats  You can get PictPixie
from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqtstuffpictpixiehqx
Requires QuickTime  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  Worse PictPixie is an
unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix  There is an old version of PictPixie called
PICTCompressor floating around the net  If you have this you should trash
it as it's even buggier  Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleanedup descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewerconverter
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but
it will run without System  or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on
older systems  It does need bit QuickDraw so really old machines can't
use it  You can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacapppicturedecompresshqx  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it

If your machine is too old to run bit QuickDraw a Mac Plus for instance
GIFConverter is your only choice for singleprogram JPEG viewing  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not
all can deal with the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Adobe Photoshop version
 or later can read and write JFIFformat JPEG files use the JPEG
plugin from the Acquire menu  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it

Amiga

Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amigaphysikunizhch   There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one  In the USA a good
choice is wuarchivewustledu look under mirrorsamigaphysikunizhch

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewerconverter as well as being a
general image manipulation tool  It's cheap shareware  and can read
several formats besides JPEG  The current version is   A demo version
is available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxedithamlabdlha  The demo version will crop images larger
than x but it is otherwise fully functional

Rend shareware  is an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM
and GIF images  The program can be used to create animations even
capturing frames onthefly from rendering packages like Lightwave  The
current version is  available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror
sites file amigaosgfxrendlha  Note although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS  programs the program will also run under
AmigaDOS   or 

Viewtek is a free JPEGILBMGIFANIM viewer  The current version is 
available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxshowViewTeklha

If you're willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend
and Viewtek  These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and
ImageFX an impressive bit image capture conversion editing painting
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products  Art Department Professional ADPro
from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas  ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another
wellregarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites in directory amigagfxconv file
AmigaJPEGVlha  These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPMGIFTarga formats

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quickanddirty JPEG programs many
based on an ancient betatest version of the free IJG JPEG software thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its diskofthemonth without
so much as notifying the authors  Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG
VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of  In my opinion
anything older than IJG version  March  is not worth the disk space
it's stored on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer

Atari ST

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc
from atariarchiveumichedu file atariGraphicsjpegbinzoo
These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPM GIF Targa formats

For monochrome ST monitors try MGIF which manages to achieve fourlevel
grayscale effect by flickering  Version  reads JPEG files  Available
from atariarchiveumichedu file atariGraphicsmgifbzoo

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEGcapable viewers for
Ataris but surely there must be some by now  Pointers appreciated

Acorn Archimedes

ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS  version  can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by doubleclicking

Recent versions since  of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG along with about  other image formats  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards the current version is only available by
registering with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink   WJ Enschede
The Netherlands  Price  Dutch guilders about  or  pounds

There's also a commercial product called JPEG which provides JPEG readwrite
functionality and direct JPEG viewing as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs  Contact DT Software FREEPOST
Cambridge UK  Tel  

NeXT

ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format
conversions  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it
ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at
sonataccpurdueedu and csorstedu somewhere in pubnext both are
currently being reorganized so it's hard to point to specific
subdirectories  Note that there is an older version floating around that
does not support JPEG


Portable software for almost any system

If none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in B  You'll also need a viewer program
If your display is  bits or less any GIF viewer will do fine if you have a
display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM bit image files

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings with more popping up every
day  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow  In that case
purchase a hardwareassisted product  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files

  What's all this hoopla about color quantization

Most people don't have fullcolor  bit per pixel display hardware
Typical display hardware stores  or fewer bits per pixel so it can display
 or fewer distinct colors at a time  To display a fullcolor image the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors  This process is called color quantization  This is something
of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  We're stuck with
the standard usage though

Clearly color quantization is a lossy process  It turns out that for most
images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings

Since JPEG is a fullcolor format converting a color JPEG image for display
on bitorless hardware requires color quantization  This is true for
all color JPEGs even if you feed a orlesscolor GIF into JPEG what
comes out of the decompressor is not  colors but thousands of colors
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors  Each original color gets smeared
into a group of nearby colors  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image
source  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output

Incidentally because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences  I occasionally see
posted images described as color JPEG  This tells me that the poster
a hasn't read this FAQ and b probably converted the JPEG from a GIF
JPEGs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG

On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
 or fewer colors  A GIF does have a definite number of colors in its
palette and the format doesn't allow more than  palette entries
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don't have to
This is also the disadvantage of GIF you're stuck with the sender's
quantization  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image
Furthermore if the sender didn't use a highquality color quantization
algorithm you're out of luck

For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware  Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in
this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have  With a GIF you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent

It's also worth mentioning that many GIFviewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines  If you view a color GIF on a color EGA
display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations one to create the GIF one to display it but often it's
also due to sloppiness  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed  Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones

Finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthanbit display
hardware already bit hicolor PC displays true bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes etc  For these people GIF is already
obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively
Thus JPEG is an allaround better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machineindependent fashion


  How does JPEG work

The buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine
transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding  This article's long enough already so I'm not going to say more
than that here  For technical information see the compcompression FAQ
This is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files
pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart  If you need help in
using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article


  What about lossless JPEG

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the
final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  However this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG
algorithm and it offers much less compression  At present very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial

Saying Q  to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step  With the V free JPEG code you can also say
sample x to turn off subsampling  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image

At this minimumloss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed bitperpixel image  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees
bitforbit accuracy

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than  bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
 or more bits per pixel furthermore JPEG is public domain at least with a
Huffman back end while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents


  Why all the argument about file formats

Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms
it does not refer to a specific image file format  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format this leaves us with a problem  In the absence of
official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
do their own thing and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's

The closest thing we have to a defacto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at CCube Microsystems  They have defined
two JPEGbased file formats
   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a lowend format that transports
    pixels and not much else
   TIFFJPEG aka TIFF  an extension of the Aldus TIFF format  TIFF is
    a highend format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEGrelated products it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now the
TIFF  spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details  Even when TIFFJPEG is well
defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common
denominator TIFFJPEG files may never be as transportable

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh  QuickTime uses a JFIFcompatible format wrapped
inside the Macspecific PICT structure  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are
available to do it see Mac portion of section A  If you have an editor
that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand see section  for details

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs GIFJPGJPGGIF and
Image Alchemy  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format  By default though they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI  This format is NOT readable by any nonHSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings  Use the j switch to get JFIF output  This
applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit JFIF
format by default  You still should be careful not to post HSIformat
files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonPC platforms


  How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEGbased format  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file

  A JFIFstandard file will start with the characters hex FF D FF E
    followed by two variable bytes often hex   followed by 'JFIF'

  If you see FF D at the start but not the rest of it you may have a
    raw JPEG file  This is probably decodable asis by JFIF software 
    it's worth a try anyway

  HSI files start with 'hsi'  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they
    won't decompress properly with nonHSI programs

  A Macintosh PICT file if JPEGcompressed will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header scan for 'JFIF'  Strip off
    everything before the FF D and you should be able to read it

  Anything else it's a proprietary format or not JPEG at all  If you are
    lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream look for FF D
    try stripping off everything before that

In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	begin line
	MCX 

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	begin line
	M'I 

If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading nonJFIF files


  What about arithmetic coding

The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output
of compressed data either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed
The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file  On typical images arithmetic coding
produces a file  or  percent smaller than Huffman coding  All the
filesize numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding

Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi
Thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses
from these companies  The fair use doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best

At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles  In particular arithmetic coding should not
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future  Stay tuned for further details


  Does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression

It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could
decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE  In general recompressing an altered
image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an
identical JPEG file  Even this is not true at least not with the current
free JPEG software  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error  If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration
output  It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change
One of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it

In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original
quality setting would introduce no further loss  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation
If you're wondering why it's because the pixelblock boundaries move
If you cropped off only multiples of  pixels you might be safe but
that's a mighty limited capability

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps  Use a lossless format
PPM RLE TIFF etc while working on the image then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away  Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot
of compressiondecompression time this way 


  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG

As stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG  If you can obtain the original
fullcolor data the GIF was made from it's far better to make a JPEG from
that  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to
make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF
that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in
section  in particular cartoontype GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be larger than the GIF  So check the sizes too

Experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under  Kbytes  Also don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from fullcolor originals  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough
JPEG files would be ie shoot for  or rd the size of the GIF file
not th as suggested in earlier comparisons

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor
border around a GIF image  While useless this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files  It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing  If you are on an X Windows
system XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this

cjpeg's default Q setting of  is appropriate for fullcolor input but
for GIF inputs Q settings of  to  often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation  If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher
Q setting may not be necessary

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool
your eye into seeing more than the  colors that GIF can actually store
If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  The
trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like highspatialfrequency
color noise and JPEG can't compress noise very well  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image if you had it
To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image
than you'd get without smoothing

With the V free JPEG software or products based on it a simple smoothing
capability is built in  Try smooth  or so when converting GIFs
Values of  to  seem to work well for highquality GIFs  Heavyhanded
dithering may require larger smoothing factors  If you can see regular
finescale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong
smoothing is definitely called for  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image which you don't want  If you are an image processing
wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package  However cjpeg's builtin smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol

The upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality  smooth  is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs  But if you really care about the
image you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings

particular contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeginfouunetuunet

In article suatINNqsnonamesnerdcufledu LIONESSufccufledu writes
My threed library does a lot of projections  duh  but currently it
is projecting an object's vertices on a per triangle basis  This is
grossly inefficient for  of the objects displayed  which can
be optimized by doing projections ONE time once for each vertex  but
objects whose Zextents intersect the hither plane can't benefit from
this because new vertices must be created during Zclipping

Anyone have any better ideas

Yes  Here's what you should do

Keep the vertices in an array and have the polygons triangles are okay
but nsided polygons are slightly more efficient store the indices into
the array of the vertices that comprise them  You set a flag for each
vertex when you transform it so you don't have to transform any vertex
more than once you also do backface elimination before processing the
polygon so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have
to be transformed at all

Whenever you transform a vertex check if it's on the far side of the hither
plane if it is you can project it right away and store the result

Then do your Z clip any vertices that get produced will have to have their
projection done at that stage

Hello networld

I'm looking for documentationbooks on parametric drafting

Does anyone know of such material electronic on a Gopherftpsite
or booksauthors

Im not looking for commercial software rather info on implementation 
and theory of the subject Im planning to make a parametric
generator for autocad and i would need some referance

Everything you know is of interest

Thanks in advace

Lasse

I have posted DISPZIP to altbinariespicturesutilities
I will upload this package to SIMTEL later

   You may distribute this program freely for noncommercial use
         if no fee is gained
   There is no warranty The author is not responsible for any
         damage caused by this program

Important changes since Version 
  Added support for IRIS
  Support MixConcat two images
  Added support for 'batch conversion'
  Added support for 'loadsave palette table'
  Added support for 'edge enhance'
  Added support for 'crop one line'
  Added support for 'negate image'
  New color quantization option
  Fix some minor bugs

 Introduction
  This program can let you READ WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats It also let you do some special effectsROTATION DITHERING 
  on image Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts
  Include simple file management system
  Support 'slide show'
 Support 'batch conversion'
  There is NO LIMIT on image size
  Currently this program supports     bits display
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor you must have VESA driver
  If you want to modify video driver please read section 


 Hardware Requirement
  PC  or better MSDOS  or higher
  min amount of ram is M bytesMaybe less memory will also work
  I recommend min M bytes for better performance
  Hard disk for swappingvirtual memory

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP

  Supported Wares

   Up to M of extended memory expanded under VCPI
   Up to M of disk space used for swapping
   SuperVGA color mode up to x
   
   XMS  VDISK memory allocation strategies
   VCPI programs such as QEMM DESQview and MAX

  Unsupported

   DPMI
   Microsoft Windows

  Features  emulator bit unixish environment flat memory
  model SVGA graphics


 Installation
  Video drivers emu and goexe are borrowed from DJGPP
  If you use Western Digital VGA chips read readmewd
  This GOEXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version
   But some people report that this goexe is not compatible with
      other DJGPP programs in their system If you encounter this problem
      DON'T put goexe within search path

   Please read runmebat for how to run this program

  If you choose xxxxxgrn as video driver add 'nc ' to environment
    GO

  For example godriver xxxxxxxxxxxgrn nc 

  If you don't have x add 'emu xxxxxxemu' to environment GO

  For example godriver xxxxxxxxxxxgrd emu xxxxxxemu

   Notes  I only test trgrn etgrn and vesagrn
                 Other drivers are not tested
               I have modified etgrn to support     bits
                 display You don't need to use vesa driver
                 If etgrn doesn't work please try vesagrn
               For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display
                 please use vesagrnexcept et users
                 You can find vesa BIOS driver from

 Detail

   Initialization
      Set default display type to highest display type
      Find allowable screen resolutionfor grn video driver only

    When you run this program you will enter 'read' menu Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key If you move or copy
      files you will enter 'write' menu the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu but only allow you to change directory
      The header line in 'read' menu includes dxxfxxtxx
        d  display type f number of files t number of tagged files
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is
        The procedure is First check magic number If fail check
        standard extension Still fail report error
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'
        If delay time is  program will wait until you hit a key
          except ESCAPE
        If any error occurs program will make a beep
       'w' or 'W' to pause any key to continue
        ESCAPE to terminate
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type
      pressing ALTX in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting
     pressing F will turn on 'effect' menu

    Once image file is successfully read you will enter 'screen' menu
      You can do special effect on image
      pressing RETURN show image
        in graphic mode press RETURN SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode
      pressing TAB change processing target This program allows you to do
        special effects on bit or bit image
      pressing LeftRight arrow change display type     bits
      pressing SPACE save current image to file
        BW Dither save as blackwhite image bit
        Grey Scale save as grey image bits
        Full Color save as color image bits
        True Color save as bit image

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file Some questions are formatdependent Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory please press SPACE after
        pressing SPACE you will enter 'write' menu You can change
        directory to what you want Then

        pressing SPACE this program will prompt you 'original' filename
        pressing RETURN this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      filename under bar


   This program supports     bits display

   This Program is MEMORY GREEDY If you don't have enough memory
     the performance is poor

   If you want to save  bits image 
       try GIF then TIFFLZW then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then 

     If you want to save  bits image lossless
       try TIFFLZW or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       No one is better for true bits image

   I recommend Jpeg for storing  bits images even  bits images

   Not all subroutines are fully tested

   This document is not well written If you have any PROBLEM SUGGESTION
     COMMENT about this program
     Please send to ubicmoseenctuedutw 
     I need your suggestion to improve this program
     There is NO anonymous ftp on this site

If it takes making it an alt group then why not  I've been following
this thread for what has it been two months now

The alt hierarchie is created for  purposes
 For groups which do not fit under the comp or other 'official'
  hierarchies
 For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like altgulfwar

Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities
sites are free to decide not to carry some of the alt groups

Therefore it is I think desirable to try to create compgraphics
raytrace rendering or whatever and not an altgroup

In D Studio is there any way to create refraction diffraction etc 

I want to simulate such things as glass lenses bottles etc

There might be an IPAS routine that does thatbut I can'r be sure  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection  It will
take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection but that's
the only thing I can think of

Hi all
I have this program in which user can display many images onebyone on the
display Now I am trying to get the best poosible color allocation So
each time I open a image I try to allocate the colors reqd for that image
approach similar to that used in xv by john bradley The problem 
comes when I try to display the next image Now I have effectively tied
myself to the colors of the previous image So the second image doesnot come
up in original colorsie the colors it would have shown had it been
displayed first 
I know that I can display only  colors or whatever depth of the display
at a time But I also dont want the color reproduction dependent on the
sequence in whihc you display the image 
So what is the best way out

Please rewpond to vijayiitbernetin

Hi I'm new to imaging and my advisor and I would like to 
do some D reconstructions

We take slides biological and image them on a   Then
the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects 
we want to save  The outlines are stored as a TIFF file

We would like to convert a group of these outlines into a 
D image  We are unsure as to where to begin  Someone mentioned
that if we could convert the TIFF into a vector format then 
we could view them in Autocad

Any help would be greatly appreciated

Hello

	Does anyone know of an image format conversion tool that will convert a 
raw  bit grey scale image to Gif or Tif format  It would be great if the tool
ran on a PC was a Windows application and supported other formats but I'll be 
happy with anything that works

 I've got this animation file with a GL extension
 What is this  Are there anu MSDOS or OS programs
 which will run this file  Thanks
 

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames usually stored as PIC or CLP files fonts and a TXT file
that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it  GL stands
for Grasp Library  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the altbinariespictures FAQ

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files and they are usually
named GRASPRTEXE replace the  with a version digit or letter  Most
GL files contain frames that are hardwarespecific to particular modes
of the CGA EGA or VGA adapters on PCs  I think that there are some
copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp I know that I got one there
a long time ago

Many highend graphics cards come with C source code for doing basic graphics
sorts of things change colors draw pointslinespolygonsfills etc  Does
such a library exist for generic VGA graphics cardschips hopefully in the
public domain  This would be for the purpose of compiling under a nonDOS
operating system running on a standard PC


I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library 
package to do PC VGA graphics  

I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a 
nonDOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics  I'm not sure if 
reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not  
I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that 
handles graphics requests queued on a mailbox one at a time  If this 
provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can 
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library  

Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something
what do you think

express all angles as PI  angle  PI
Add all entries in the table If the sum   the point is outside If

I currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any

like to display these images on a PC  The conversion to a GIF format
would be helpful  This conversion can take place either on a PC
or on a UNIX system and I could then download it to the PC
Can anyone suggest where I can find software to do this  Alternatively I
may have to write my own conversion program  In this case could someone
tell me where I can find the GIF format specification

Hello

We are looking for a graphics package preferably complete
with source code that will run on our UNIX operating system
a Sequent running DYNIX   This graphics package must 
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
PC's running a terminal emulator primarily  
At this point X graphics is not an option

This graphics program should if possible support these
sorts of graphics operations minimum requirements

    Complicated axes log linear etc with fairly
      precise axis labels multiline labels etc
      Major and minor tickmarks on axes etc	
  
    It would be nice if some limited amount of color
      plotting were available if the output device
      supported it

We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it but
gnuplot has some limitations  We are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot

At this point I'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems  If you have any information please
contact me at the above email address  If the product you know
about is a commercial software package please send a phone number
or email address so that I can contact them about pricing etc

I'd like to know if there is any system CPU  HD array  framebuffer
which can play and record HDTV quality moving picture in realtime

HDTV has about MBframe so recordingplaying moving picture will need
about MBsec bandwidth I'm thinking to treat the raw data not
compressed 

	Actually for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than
you need unless there's some reason you must work in fullyuncompressed
HDTV  Also my calculations is that each frame should be well under MB
even using  bitspixel which is more bits than you actually need   or
 should be enough for a moving picture  xxbits is MB I'm
guessing at HDTV resolution  it may be a bit wider than  I'm fairly
sure of the  number for most of the digital proposals

	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well  MBs while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system

	Unless you have a very compelling reason I'd advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data  You don't have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier
to deal with

assembly which I don't know written into apps hat use mode h To get
any speed at all you have to do this How do I do it

	 The vesa standard What gives here I have read most of what
the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of
the advice is cryptic at best Where do I get public domain info that will
tell me in mostly plain english how the vesa calls work

	My biggest gripe is about number  I have bought graphics books
I have asked graphics professors I have hunted the net through both
gopher and archie I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is
some lock on this information Graphics programming books tell alot of
programmiing algorithm information but they always fall short of telling
you how to really control the video bios What are all the calls folks I
know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff Where
are you and why haven't you written a book yet 

Please help

Thanks in advance

How does the  bit color of HDTV work  It can not be  bit Red Green and
Blue like on the Macintosh This gives only  gray levels

Apple also has developed a pointpoint network that is around MB not
sure if it is bits or bytes per sec

  It only means thief if you want it to mean that  To me it means

 Anyway if I say Joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who
 know the word they'll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a
 bad carpenter But there are very very few people who will think he is

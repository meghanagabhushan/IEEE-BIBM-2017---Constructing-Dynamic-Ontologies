Summary Earl Weaver Commandments

	The Orioles' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season
Four shutouts low team ERA Well I haven't gotten any baseball news since
March  but anyways Could they contend yes Could they win it all  Maybe

But for all those fans of teams with bad spring records remember Earl
Weaver's first law of baseball From his book on managing

No one gives a damn in July if you lost a game in March 

BTW anyone have any idea on the contenders for the O's fifth starter
It's pretty much set that Sutcliffe Mussina McDonald and Rhodes are the
first four in the rotation

Here at Johns Hopkins University where the mascot is the Blue Jay 
their baseball team logo was the Toronto club's logo Now it's a 
anatomically correct blue jay God can't they think of an original idea
It's even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the O's hats
How many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole

I've read all of the followups to this but I thought I'd go back to the
original article to make specific comments about the method


jaomegatestcom John Oswalt said

He has obtained the play by play records in computer readable
form for every major league baseball game for the past several years
He devised an algorithm which I call sumoversituations and wrote
a computer program to calculate every major league players contribution
using it  It works like this

Look at every situation in every game in a baseball season  A
situation is determined by inning score where the baserunners are
and how many outs there are  For each situation count how many
times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in
and divide by the number of times the situation came up to come up with
a value for that situation

This was first done by George Lindsey in the late 'searly 's and
reported in 

	Article	An Investigation of Strategies in Baseball
	Author		George R Lindsey
	Journal	Operations Research
	Issue		Volume   JulyAugust  pp 

Later Pete Palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate
a larger set of data to avoid the kind of smallsample anomalies that other
people have worried about  He reported this in TheHiddenGameofBaseball
with John Thorn  Gary Skoog modified the method a bit and did some work
on what he called a Value Added measure based on these situational values
His were based directly on marginal runs though not on win probabilities
These results as applied to the  season were reported in one of the
Bill James Baseball Abstract books   Help me out here somebody

For example a situation might be inning  score  runner on second
and no outs  There were  regular season major league games last
year  With the Rockies and Marlins there will be more this year
Say this situation came up in  of those and the team ahead won
 of them  Then the value of this situation is 

Description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat
 plus any baserunning and creditdebit the player by that amount each time
 he gets a plate appearance

Now for each player sum up all his atbat and baserunning values
for the season to obtain an overall value for that player  Obviously
the sum of all players' values for each game and for the season as a
whole will be 

That's only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher
there's no validation involved

OK there's a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on you're
adding probabilities and probabilities don't add  Runs you can add the
total team runs breaks down into how many runs Joe contributed plus how many
runs Fred contributed etc  But probabilities don't work that way  If Bob
increases his team's chance of winning by  in each of  PAs that does
not mean that Bob increased his team's chance of winning by   In fact
it doesn't mean anything because the units are screwy

I agree and disagree  John is saying that the batters efforts will result
in  more wins then losses  While you are probably correct that 
does not mean  more wins then losses it means something  I would
rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by  in
each of  PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning
by  in each of  PAs  Thus there appears to me to be an obvious
positive association between John's statistic and winning games  Thus
before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must
go into what sort of relationship there is

Consider an example  Bob hits a out solo HR in the bottom of the first
about  on your scale  He does the same thing again in the fourth with
the score tied for another   And again in the seventh with the score
tied for another   And finally in the ninth to win the game by a score
of  for a value of   Bob hit  solo HR in  plate appearances and
was credited by your method with           But what does
that mean  Was Bob  responsible for the win  Certainly not the defense
is always  responsible if you include pitching in that and Bob wasn't
pitching  In fact Bob was only  of the offense which is a lot but not
even close to   Furthermore what about the other  team runs  Say
they all came on solo HR by Fred then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game
which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead see Lindsey and Fred will
himself have accrued a good  rating or so  So Fred and Bob combined have
amassed  of a win IN ONE GAME  There's clearly a problem here

The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
how many wins the team has  First we are using averages over many
seasons and applying them to one game  Second remember some players
performance take away from the chance of you winning  That is a
player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases
Thus I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
for a team who won that they will add up to  in that game  Sometimes
they will add up to more then one sometime less than one  Also
the pitchers' bad performances giving up  runs may have given
them a large negative percentage for that game  Also any batter that
pulled an  night would give large negatives  



Greg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the
mark  Closers are enormously important  The total number of runs
value is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming
The doubling which Greg allows is not enough

In another article I proposed a test of this  We can predict a team's 
wonlost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they
score and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game  If
late runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at
late runs should lead to a better predictor right

No but really only because you have a smaller sample size  I would
think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning
would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score 
in the last inning  And realize something else a closer usually
comes in in a close situation not a blow out  It is hard to argue
that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
to those given up in the first inning  Look a closer giving up runs
often means a team will lose many games  On the other hand a starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win  The
offence has many more outs to do something about  But I am not
saying all late inning situations are equally important either  If
I am down  runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth       

Here's another thought experiment apply this method to basketball  What
you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost
exactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play
Furthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with
no time on the clock gets a  for the game while the star forward who 
scored  points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero

Does this make sense


No but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
be  before the possesion in which the free throws were made  Look
if you are down  point with  seconds left there is a fairly high
probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
ball  And do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers
fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team
would win
 
From reading all of the discussion on this statistic I feel that those
who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda
At first look this statistic valadates clutchness  But it really
does not  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
goes down  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens
So if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except
for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to
player performance  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you
do not believe in clutchness  Certainly we could find out what
the average value of a home run is for example  We may find for
instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by 
on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 
I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses

How do we evaluate relief pitchers  Say John and Sam have the
exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs K's BB's
etc  Both had exceptional numbers  John however only pitched
in closer situations while Sam was a Mop up man  Who was more
valuble to their team  Probably John  Who was the better 
pitcher  They were probably about the same

Summary OPCY is just too small

Hell the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history
if we had a stadium with  seats But unfortunely the Yards a
definitely excellent ballpark only holds like  with  SRO spots
Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast Bleacher seats are almost
gone for every game this year It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's
could sell out every game this year especially if we lead the division for
most of the year like ' 
	On another front the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be
forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently Maybe we can get an
owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter
	Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter The O's pitching
staff looks pretty good Sutcliffe Mussina McDonald Rhodes and Fernando
	Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East

There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid  I thought
I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant  I splurged
and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars the
highestpaid player is Frank Thomas at K  I cut some players like
Kenny Lofton Chris Hoiles Keith Mitchell Tim Wakefield and a bunch
of pitchers all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
cost of  million for the lot of them  The total team salary is 
 averaging slightly over K a player  If that's too steep
you can dump Thomas and Bagwell replacing them with Paul Sorrento and
a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars and still have one
of the best teams in the majors

I doubt Henderson would clear waivers  And if he did he would

The rotation has changed due to a strange injury to Scott Erickson  He 
developed a twinge in the stomach area and has been taken out of the 
rotation  New rotation to the best of my mind's knowledge is
Kevin Tapani Jim Deshais Pat Mahomes Willie Banks

Add Mike Trombley in there somewhere since they need five people  Mark
Guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty

As to SS and B
Short will be played by Scott Leius who played short for much of his career 
before the Twins  At third Mike Pagliarulo and Jeff Reboulet will platoon

Pags and Terry Jorgenson will platoon at third with Reboulet as the
backup infielder  Pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who
lead the league in DA in  muffing what should be routine grounders
heck muffing a grounder I would probably have gotten to  Jorgenson
did nothing exceptional that I noticed  Leius missed a ball I think
Gagne would have reached we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season

Winfield has struggled during preseason  Sunday against the Colorado 
Rockies he went  for  with  RBIs and scored once

He looked pretty good there  Contrary to what the mediots have been saying
he looked reasonable at first  He isn't mids Hrbek but then neither is
the Pretty Big Guy himself any more note  I'm used to seeing the Twins
B looking kinda big on the field but not that big  If he hits vaguely
like last year he's a perfectly good first baseman

Note  Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game
where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings  Winfield may
have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up he didn't have to
pick any bad throws for example but I'll take what I saw so far

Hi all

I've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or
two without access to really important information  I saw the  million
shoulder back on the DLHow long is he out for ie How many millionsinning
will he get this year  Nothing personal against Higuera mind you just
wondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current
big producers go over a relative pittance Please realize the term 
relative pittance can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball
salaries

Additional questions  I did'nt get to see Bones pitch this springhow is
he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation

How is Surhoff shaping up defensively at third

Are they going to build a new stadium  When

 Derek Bell trade was the fact that San Diego included  in the

 money didn't go to the Blue Jays  In Toronto the money was diverted
 into a London bank account owned by a shadowy character named Vincent

I should be so lucky the account number must have been rejected 

 The odd thing was that Gray wasn't some British financier but a
 Canadian social scientist working at the University of Western
 Ontario  Gray was previously known to the authorities only as an

 discovered the True Tater Name of Bing Bang Ben MacDonald

To be accurate it is Big Bang Ben MacDonald

 Soon after that Gray and Palmer sent word to Ottawa that Canada had
 achieved absolute superiority over the United States in the field of
 baseballistic research as she controlled both the AckerCook

I hope not  To think that I would inadvertantly give any pleasure to

 Vince can take this post as the cue to chime in about what he plans to

 pick up that truckload of Denis Boucher cards I bought to fill in the

Realizing the taterific importance of this work John Palmer and I
concluded that we might be able to pool some resources I have not yet
gone through the archives that Jonathan sent to me when I do I will
send out an official introduction to the Deep Drive Derby

However I wonder if we need to rename the project now that the
principal investigator and research archive have changed Send your
suggestions for a rename of the study to me at the address given
above

And just think  it's opening day  Soon the balls will be flying
out no get your minds out of the gutter of the ball parks and
helpless bystanders will be injured by balls reentering the
atmosphere and you thought that meteorite showers were made of
rocks

Who will be the stars this year Can anyone hope to combat Brad

The season is young the balls newly rubbed in mud the hot dogs
starting to boil for the rest of the year Play ball and take cover

And may all your sliders hang

     Philadelphia at Chicago  Teams tied for st after Sunday
     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series  One Friday one Saturday and a goodold Sunday doubleheader
What could be better declared Ernie Banks  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs
are challenging
     It's pitching it's always been pitching that we've lacked announced
Ryne Sandberg  If we can get by Brewer then beat Carlton Alexander or
Bunning  preferrably  of the last three  we'll know we might be able to
win
     Lord I hope we pull it off
     The Phils scored once in the top of the first Richie Ashburn singled Pete
Rose followed with a hit sending Ashburn around second  Kiki Cuyler cut
the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks who threw
to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third  Rose went to second on the play
     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving Pete Rose to
third  Schmidt was walked  the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw  walks this
year  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a
gap in rightcenter  Cool Papa Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent Schmidt from scoring  Nellie Fox was walked and Bob Boone
grounded out to second ending the threat  
     Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or
Torrienti and that is lowering their run total  It puts a lot of pressure on
Klein and Dick Allen who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells
Rose at first and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to
sustain their pace  The picthers have slumped at times  So came the
analysis from Frank Chance
     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit Thomas' grounder
moved him to second and  after Sandberg made out  Billy Williams singled
home a run  In the sixth Ron Santo launched a tworun homer to make it
  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth as Schmidt singled and Klein
singled him to third  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox but Dick Allen popped
out of the dugout to hit  Allen doubled to right but luckily for the Cubs
Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense
He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third  Lance Parrish hitting
for Boone was walked and Bruce Sutter entered  Larry Bowa grounded into
a  double play but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinchhitter  Desiring a
strikeout since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
Trillo pinchrunning at third Chance brought in Lee Smith who induced a
popup to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning  The
Cubs took the win  moving a game behind the Phillies
     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle Finger Brown Saturday  To get
another righthander in the lineup Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock
played third  Unfortunately Brown allowed six doubles and the Cub bullpen
was worn down even more as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against
Lefty  Madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving
home four runs  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs and Cuyler added
another and the score was  Cubs after six innings  The Phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the Cubs grabbed  more
runs to ice an  triumph
     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one
point including a rare outsidethepark home run in the second game off
Robin Roberts  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest  but
the Cubs captured the second one  with Waddell gaining the win  Bruce
Sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the
eighth  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these coleaders and would
conclude their series with the Expos on Monday

     Montreal at St LouisAugust  way tie for st
     Dennis Martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday
The Expos have a wide variety of hitters and  while they aren't among the
alltime greats they are getting the job done  After winning their first
first two games they suddenly found themselves only   games out of
first in this wacky season
     Martinez triumphed  on Friday and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 
Saturday  However the Cardinals refused to give up winning  on Sunday
The Cards captured Monday's game too as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve
Rogers   We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed remarked Lou Brock  I don't see why we can't win this
division
     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them  Twothirds of
the way through the season there is a way tie for first

     New York at PittsburghAugust   straight  wins for Bucs
now  back  but in th
    When your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher's park like this spoke Gil Hodges before the series  Keith
Hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year
and it must be giving them an extra  wins  The Pirates have made only
 errors all season  ahead of the second place Dodgers  Error totals tend
to be around  for the best defensive AllTime teams
     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez  Friday and Candelaria outshone
Seaver  Saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense  When
Nolan Ryan and two relivers hit the Mets in another  win Sunday the
Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
 mark  They had been unable to several times in the past month  Bert
Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game  Both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs  a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a tworun blast by Ralph
Kiner for the Pirates  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco working his second inning after Mookie
Wilson pinchran for Gary Carter at second  With one out and a runner on
first Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinchhit  The Pirates countered with Kent
Tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing
Strawberry at second  He slid hard into Honus Wagner preventing the
Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon  Tekulve
allowed a hit but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right
field line ending the inning  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers who entered
to pitch the eighth and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep
center running through the stop sign at third to score an insidethepark
homer to win  The Pirates had scored an improbable  straight  wins
and had moved to within  games of first place with seven weeks to go

     San Francisco at BoswauktaAugust  
    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the Giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just wouldn't tire  In fact reported manager John McGraw
once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming
week we may shift to a man rotation again for a little while
     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday beating Lew Burdette and
the Braves   Willie Mays had all four rbis on  hits  Rick Reuschel
faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest  The Braves' park had been a homer
haven but this took the cake as the Giants won a seesaw affair 
Willie Mays had three homers Willie McCovey Eddie Matthews and Don
Baylor had two and Hank Aaron Ernie Lombardi Biz Mackey and Mel Ott had
one each  The Braves had collected  home runs going into Sunday's
doubleheader putting them on a pace for  which would be  short of the
National League record  They were still a tad behind the ' Yankees' pace
They had allowed over  though  Vida Blue actually got the win after
retiring  batters in the fifth  He allowed only a run in the sixth but
faltered in the seventh  Joe McGinnity earned the save
     In the doubleheader the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the
Braves won   The Giants took the second game however by a  score
The homer by Aaron was a magical  by the Braves however they fell to
three game below  making a comeback extremely unlikely

     San Diego at CincinnatiAug   Randy Jones faced Ewell
Blackwell in the first of this game series and the Padres felt rather
good  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game the
trade looked even better  McGriff's batting average was even rising  Of
course the bench was very poor and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the
outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up
     Jones pitched a good game Friday and won   McGriff launched two
home runs  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray
Narleski Saturday  was the final score  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel
Paige to a  tie through eight innings before departing  The game was
scoreless for  more innings until the thirteenth  Paige had departed after
 and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning  Tom Browning was working
his second scoreless inning when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and
Joe Gordon was pitched around  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home
and the Padres gamed a  win  The threegame sweep had pulled the
Giants into a tie with the Reds  Though the Reds denied it the highly
emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them

     Brookangeles at HoustonAugust 
     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the Astrodome  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in
the first game opposite Don Drysdale  Normally Drysdale remarked I
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them  I can't afford
to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we can't
afford to let the Astros beat us  He then winked and said Well maybe
Davis will get decked once
     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six  is
primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season  The hitting on this team is
a little better but the power is all doubles and triples  Still Carl Furillo is
the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw
two runners out trying for insidethepark homers  For those unaware of
the nastness of the Astros' park they have a foot high gray wall all
around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs  The
foul poles are  feet from home plate but the alleys are  feet away
with center field at  feet  It's as if some threeyearold threw a
tantrum and told his playmates 'If I can't hit home runs nobody will hit
home runs' remarked Roy Campanella
     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday but the Astros decided to revitalize
the Baltimore chopping that had failed  weeks before for tonight anyway
Davis Jim Wynn and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings
according to the manager  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the
Baltimore chop Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch  He responded with
a tworun double but Wynn  playing first for Davis  popped up and the
Astros didn't score any more in that inning  They did score  in the fourth to
erase a  deficit and the Astros wound up winning   They threatened
to do even better the next game as Tommy John would be their opponent
Walt Alston met privately with the starters at  AM before the game
     I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop he explained
     How can we do that Pee Wee Reese wondered
     They're going to be beating the ball down so we've got to be ready to
throw on the run  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but I
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws  We'll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time
     The plan almost worked  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings but the Astros got three two of them scored when Bill Doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third   Astros was the final with Dave Smith earning another save  The
Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday as Nolan
Ryan walked five three of whom scored in a  Dodger win  Fernando
Valenzuela lost the second game  to Don Sutton however as the Dodgers'
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough
     We're mostly a power team remarked Ron Cey  Jackie and when he
plays Maury Wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other
plays can do it now and then  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome  I
guess that's why they're so successful there  Indeed it seems that
basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome  The 'Stros
swiped  bases in  attempts giving them  on the season
     Standings after these weekend series

Dave 'This has never happened to me before' Kirsch writes
  Correction Nied was the only player identified in this book as a grade A
prospect who was exposed to the draft according to Bill James in the
'Stop the Presses' section preceding his player evaluations He valued Nied
at  and said that Nied's value does not increase significantly as a
result of his selection although he did catch a break getting away from the
strongest rotation in baseball 

I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked  I bought
it but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY
looking at it first  What tripe

The book is inconsistent and filled with selective analysis  James
claims to be looking forward and then makes some absolutely bizarre
statements of value  Not only that but I got the impression he
probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name
on it 

To say I was disappointed is a grand understatement

Let's look at the effects of inflation on 's superstars' salaries

I read once that the Babe made  one year and that was about as good 
as it got for him

Let's assume he made that in  I'm not sure of the figures but I know
I'm in the ballparkpun intended 

Today assuming a  yearly inflation rate which is an understatement if
not accurate his measly  salary would be worth

FV   x 
     x 
    just over 

Assuming inflation is average of around 

FV   x 
    almost 

I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand

These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly 
overpaid  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above
average players make now  Perfectly accurate salary year of salary and 
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate but I dont 
think I'm off by much

Everytime I have written on the net about the possibility of a
successfuls season by the Philadelphia Phillies I have gotten ripped
from everybody from Pittsburgh to Calcutta  But if all the
ignoramouses care to look at this week's Baseball Weekly they will see
that I'm not the only one who considers then as division winners  the
rest of the most respected baseball writers in the country do as well
 
 And these guys certainly know what they're talking about  Every
 bozo from Pittsburgh to Calcutta will just have to sit up and take
 notice  This Phils team in an offensive juggernaut which is going
 to score a LOT of runs and put up a TON of hits on the scoreboard
 You people out there are going to be sick of seeing PHILLIES
 scattered all over every offensive league leaders category in the
 newspaper  These guys hit  through Spring Trainingwell before
 getting no hit yesterday  But they had a plane to catch  minutes
 after the game ended so they're minds weren't in it

Up to this point I really thought this had been written by a 
proSDCN antimediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
sarcasm and biting remarks  Somebody like me for instance
The lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the
original poster

 Now on top of the great offense they have a slightly above average
 pitching staff which has a lot of youth and promise  If the
 pitchers do their part and Mitch keeps blown saves to a minimum
 look for another pennant out in left field at the Vet
 
 Robert C Hite
 
 PS Michael Jack Schmidt for COMMISSIONER

But then the scales were lifted from my eyes  Looks like Robert is
really being serious  Oh well

I compare the performance of the  Phillies with the  edition
which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS yet
finished at a frustrating sub level  The  folks didn't 
ever amount to anything and neither will the  squad IMHO

Any other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's
editions in the style of  Braves   Orioles

mssnetcomcom Mark Singer said

I meant that one should not let the exception make the rule  

It's not an exception  Good players come up young most players who come
up young will be good  This has always been the rule


Are most players who come up young always good when they're young or
later

Worse it's not a shift  This is the way it has always been  Several
detailed studies of this have been done and they've all shown that players
aren't coming up any younger or older than in the past and they aren't 
playing any more or less in the minors than they used to  The only thing
that shifts is our memories of the good old days 

Damn  I was afraid you would say that


But all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current
discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who
hasn't established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran  The
Padres played Santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth
playing  

Well perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there  But they do have others worth playing at
least in their opinion  And I happen to agree


Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers
expected to be among the best ever in baseball  

Not by recsportbaseball consensus  That may sound like an incredibly
arrogant comment but I've found that the SDCN consensus when one exists
is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball
people affiliated with MLB  

I can believe that  I'm a newbie here so I'll take your word  But
Alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded seasoning


I don't know who knows  I suppose the same people or similar who
know he will be better than some other catcher  These are of 
course just differing opinions  I read that his arm is not that
strong I suppose somewhere there is some measurement of SB ratios
and that he is still learning to call a game  That latter skill may
be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of
his performance but it is a tangible skill

I disagree in that I don't think it is a tangible skill any more than
leadership is  I don't deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers
may be much better than others at it but I really don't see any way that we
could ever know who they are  Nichols's Law of Catcher Defense is eerily
accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very
seriously

Sorry  New  Don't know Nichols' Law  Don't believe in catchers'
era  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers
Any info on that



Absolutely  The evidence is piling up year after year  The only other
alternative is that the Braves really don't know that their young players
are on average better than their current starters  I'm not ruling out that
kind of gross incompetence but I think the salaryschedule explanation is
more charitable

In other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind 
a different decision than we would make must be financial  I presume
we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta no


Consider we know that the Braves are about the strongest team in baseball
right now even with Olson and Lemke and Nixon and Bream in the lineup  They
have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has
It actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally
better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly let's
go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs
only as we have to so that we'll still have them under reserve three years
from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions

Is it fair to the young players  No  Does it make organizational sense 
I think it does

Well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them
for their decisions  I mean please don't tell me how to run my

and continues with

	We can win without him and then keep winning next year with him
	How's that

I'm sure you could be right  You could also be smoking some illegal
substance

Hey  That's a joke  Don't get offended  Please


Hey I'd love to be wrong about this  If you think it's unlikely I'd love
to know why  Don't cite anybody's innate ethical rectitude though unless
you know them personally


Well I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means  

But again if it makes organizational sense then so be it  Baseball
is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves should do

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision  While you from
your armchair may disagee I don't  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training  I
think it is a very normal decision to have made  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers  Sure it may be conservative  It
may also be logical  I don't know what ethics have to do with it
Seems like pretty good common sense to me

 Mike Francesa mentioned his ' baseball picks in
 passing on the radio yesterday  Being that this is Francesa
 talkin' the opinions are well worth consideration

 Indeed  After all he was the wizard foresaw the Year of the Big East in the
 NCAA Tournament  Unfortunatly none of those teams made it into the Sweet
 Sixteen much less New Orleans

Neither did he

Overall Mike Francesa has an outstanding prediction record

Overall  How do you figure

Ignore him at your own peril

Excellent point  I hope to God that Ted Simmons doesn't get the weird
idea of trading for the guy  And if he does he had better not
include Jeff King in the deal  Oh Godwhat if he traded Zane Smith

javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson
But has there ever in the history of baseball been a yearold or
younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
catchers in terms of defense and brought a  bat  Wasn't it

Not  Wasn't it Benito Santiago who was supposed to be that good
in his rookie year  Not

Hrm Sandy Alomar  year old rookie  games  Threw
out a few baserunners Benito Santiago  year old rookie  games
 He threw out a few baserunners too Ivan Rodriguez
 year old rookies  games  Didn't exactly suck
behind the plate

I can continue this thread with the others mentioned but you get
the point  You and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the 
seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies  Perhaps 
just perhaps  the management team of the pennantwinning Braves
knows something more than you do  And perhaps what they know is
that very very few  and year old rookies come up to the majors
and make an impact 

True Which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the
few Lopez' season last year adjusted to major league equivalencies was
  HRs How bad does he have to be behind the plate for that
to not be better than Olson's

I was watching Peter Gammons on ESPN last night and he's got me a little
confused

While talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit
from the fringe players they'll be facing McGriff hitting  home runs
Sheffield getting  rbi's and Glavine winning  games  This was
of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball
has expanded early 's late 's late 's

What really confused me though was the mention of AL players who would
do well next year  Specifically Roger Clemens winning  games and the
likes of McGwire and Gonzalez hitting  home runs

My question is  How in the hell will the RockiesMarlins help the AL  The
last time I looked there wasn't a lot of talent jumping leagues  Did I
miss something

Dennis Cleary
dfclearyucdavisedu


I wondered the same thing  When he first mentioned it I thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over  And then in the
examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded

So since stats NEVER lie   I guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up
players that normally they would not have had there not been expansion

At times it seems as if no others in the bullpen are used by Cox for middle

use as middle relief and thinks that Marvin might be his better choice
early in the season  I would immediately give McMchael many chances to
pitch after spring and then use Bedrock and Freeman after that  I am
wondering
how he intends to use Howell  Whatever happened to Senior Smoke
                                                      

Do you mean Juan Berenguer  He was traded for Mark Davis in the middle
of last season  Exchanged one stiff for another as Berenguer hadn't
come back from his injury in   I think he's retired now

Anyhow as middle relief Marvin ain't that bad  He at least can
pitch a couple of innings or do mopup work  I don't know much
about McMichael was he the Mexican League guy but
everybody else in the pen is a  inning man except maybe

FROM   Karim Edvard Ahmed kakandrewcmuedu

Since I haven't been able to keep up with baseball much this season I
have a few questions about my favorite team the Minnesota Twins

  How good does their rotation look  The last I heard the order is
Tapani Erikson Mahomes Banks and some guy I've never heard of 
sounds pretty pathetic to me

Well maybe it will be  Banks is a  yearold prospect who hasn't 
matured as quickly as they would have liked  Mahomes is a  yearold 
who is very highly touted  Tapani and Erickson are also young and 
have looked very good this spring  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies formerly of Houston and SD and Mike Trombley  Deshaies 
hasn't looked very good this spring so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley although they hadn't wanted  starters this unproven 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley


  Who is playing short and third

Well Scott Leius is the shortstop  He played mostly B last year but 
was a SS in the minors and moved back after Gagne left to KC  B is 
split maybe between Pagliarulo who has had a great spring and Terry 
Jorgenson a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for  
years  I'm not sure how the time will be divided but they seem to be 
happy with what they have here  I like Jorgenson but I fear they 
might give too much time to Pags
 
  How's Winfield doing

Sorry can't help you here

Dennis

  Well it really isn't this cut and dry but as a Jay fan the thing I feared
worst has happened The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start
Williams B in CF
  I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation which is
much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw
out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience Granted Witt
might be good but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters
up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has
experience
  The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the
Jays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their
pitching staff
  The Orioles should also be there in the end

This is what Jackson looked like in  with everything converted
to a neutral park on the basis of run production His equivalent
average started at  in  was up to  in  and  in  So
let us say he had established in his last two seasons a  level
of play

That is good Very good in fact But it probably doesn't make the top
ten in the league The th best EQA in the AL in  was Dave
Winfield's  Thomas was first at  First in the NL was Bonds
an incroyable  tenth was Bip Roberts  But  is better
than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter it is about what
Mattingly had in   what Felix Jose had the last two years
just ahead of Time Raines' fiveyear average better than Ryan
Klesko's MLEs 

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his hitting
That is the basis for the netcomments about him being overrated The
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter I think he was a
good maybe very good hitter He was IMO something like the th best
hitter in the majors

At age  Alomar had a brilliant rookie year  True he was limited
by injuries in his sophomore season but his numbers both that yaer
and the year following were quite mediocre  This season the same
Bill James projects a ba of  OPS of 

  The same Bill James Why do you say that It sounds like you're suggesting 
Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death Au contraire
he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign noting that he wasn't
allworld as a catcher or a hitter He called him basically average when
everyone else in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy
Campanella 

Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers
expected to be among the best ever in baseball  The reports I
read indicate that Lopez is very ordinary defensively

  Which reports are those 

The Dodgers options are Parrish and Hernandez and now only Carlos
Piazza is   As long as he continues with his very hot bat
they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive
production  When he cools off look for the much better defensive
catcher Hernandez only  to play more

  I like Hernandez a lot but if Piazza can catch the ball you've gotta play
him IMHO He's a much better hitter although Hernandez isn't a bad hitter
Right now it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez
will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler As long as they
play up to their abilities the Dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem  

The Braves options are Berryhill and Olson  I agree that Olson is
nothing special but I do think Berryhill is better than many 
people on rsb believe  But both the Braves' catchers are very
good defensively calling a game blocking the plate throwing
and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively they play on a team
that is not so much in need of another big bat

  I think both are overrated defensively see Nichols' Law of catcher
defense but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine About the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent's SB and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners
Catchers ERA is a possibility but it's subject to way too many biases 

  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat' I disagree here too About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that
they're weak offensively at several positions CF C B SS if Belliard
plays B unless Bream and Hunter form another superplatoon and very weak 
defensively if Blauser plays I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of
Mel Nieves Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot but much like the talentrich

jayson stark i think that's him fits perfectly in this category

Could be There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate 
and also for Baseball America

anyone who writes dean palmer has  homers   at this pace he'll
 have  home runs should be shot

if at the end of april he has  and anyone writes at this
 pace he'll have  homers they shouldbe shot too

Stark has done this sort of thing but he has never been serious about it
He usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of 
such columns I think he did it one season and some manager was projected 
to be thrown out of  games and some hitter could expect to be plunked 
 times

Stark does some really funny stuff His weekly baseball reviews are good 
collections of strange things that happened during the previous week He 
also regularly prints Kinerisms

Sorry this doesn't fly  The good players have always been ready
for the majors early  How many HOFers were not contributing major
leaguers by the time they were 

  That brings up an interesting point Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about
prospects and the relationship between age career length MVPs and Hall of
Fame members It was part of their preseason special Basically they looked 
at players that had amassed  plate appearances or ABs by the time they
were  and noticed some interesting things 

  For starters they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in
the history of the game They also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame The kicker though was that
they actually did some numbercrunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group They also  
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals HRs etc of the other players The first
group outhit the second something like  to  in raw BA and blew away
the second group in such categories as HRs Bs RBIs etc 

  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory

that  The guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming

Everytime I have written on the net about the possibility of a
successfuls season by the Philadelphia Phillies I have gotten ripped
from everybody from Pittsburgh to Calcutta  But if all the
ignoramouses care to look at this week's Baseball Weekly they will see
                                
that I'm not the only one who considers then as division winners  the
rest of the most respected baseball writers in the country do as well

 
And what was the reasoning of this genius writer  That even though their
pitching is at best sound they will win on the strength of their offense
Lesse
           ' offense  ' offense  Thompson  Incaviglia
 
                     ' offense   wins
                     ' division winners  at least  wins
            
So              
                wins   wins  Thompson  Incaviglia

Therefore
                wins  Thompson  Incaviglia

What did you learn in school today

If you take a math course and your teacher turns out to be Rob Rains run
don't walk to dropadd
                                                                 P Tierney
 
 You obviously don't know what the hell you're talking about  No
 Thompson and Incaviglia don't equal  wins but I'll take the two
 of them over Stan Javier and Ruben Amaro  HR AB 
  HR  AB  I'd say this improvement should equate to or 
 wins at least
 
 Then I'll take Lenny Dykstra who played  games last year and
 project his numbers   hits  B's  HR RBI  SB
 over  games Thus  hits  B's HR RBI  SB
 Okay now we'll put these numbers in the leadoff hole and thus
 I have to bump Kruk Hollins Daulton RBI numbers up just a tad
 now lesse they knocked in   and  respectively  Don't
 you think it's fair to add about  or  RBI to each  They managed
 to knock in a pretty nice amount of runs with a  leadoff hitter
 Okay bozo do you think it's fair to add maybe  or  more wins
 now    Oh and how can I forget Wes Chamberlain  AB's  HR 
  RBI even WITH a month and  in AAA and a horrible first half
 Well project that over a full season to get  HR and  RBI or so
 Is that worth a win or two  
 
 Finally take the worse pitching staff in the NL last year add
 the worse injury decimation of   Okay now we add Danny
 jackson some health and a full season for Schilling is that
 worth at least  wins
 
 Okay we've been conservative and added about  wins so far  Now
 we're adding about  more wins thanks to the expansion teams
 Okay thats  wins  Lesse dipshit math genuious     
 Hmmm I think thats good enough to win the worse division in
 baseball
 
 Next time before you say something foolish get a clue first
 
  

Actually I was simply relaying the reasoning of this socalled genius BW
writer  I agree  The reasoning was foolish  

Next time before you say something foolish be aware what you are responding
to

BTW  wins  Very funny

							April  


I am participating in an NLleague that uses standard Rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used

For position players
	lowest batting average
	strikeouts
	caughtstealing
	errors

For pitchers
	losses
	blown saves
	higest ERA
	'taters allowed

This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie
league  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
I had terrible pitching  I would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors  Anyway
someone offered

Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black

I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott
However I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season
Should I make the trade or not

Your comments will be appreciated

I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I have
for Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs game First of all how could he
start Maldonado over May After the way May played at the end of last year and
the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench Not
to mention that a right hander Maddux started I really blew my top when
Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS How can you do that
just because of the leftyrighty thing too much is made of that Wilkins is
twice the hitter that Shields is Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino one
of the weakest hitters I have ever seen and who had looked terrible at bat all
day and Lefebre let him hit while May still sat the bench I think even Arnie
Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while
Vizcaino was batting Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in
baseball

Personally I think that Alomar is all hype He is producing incredibly now
but in the long run he will never put up the numbers that Sandberg has For
THIS moment Alomar may be the best but overall Sandberg wins out by a long
shot

When Sandberg was Alomar's age he was putting up  seasons with no power
Alomar's  OBA is  points higher than Sandberg's career high  Alomar's
career high in doubles and triples is higher than Sandberg's  Sandberg is
still better than Alomar but only because Alomar hasn't reached his full
potential yet  Alomar's got a  yearheadstart on Sandberg he has 
hits Sandberg didn't have  hits until he was  and is likely to
put up better career numbers than Sandberg in everything except home runs
He'll pass Sandberg in stolen bases sometime in 

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases  What competition did 
Alomar have  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken and the same year as Boggs
Gwynn and the other magicians  So less attention was given to Sandberg 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre  Besides the 
numbers don't count  National league pitchers are much better pitchers

an excellent defensive catcher I agree that his offensive skills are
limited but he does seem to be improving on them

Let's see what he does wo the help of a pitchout every other pitch
As I remember even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under

out  Of course he suffered from  ball  strike homers a lot too

Is there any doubt that this is true  After a few down years the AL East
is back to where it was in the early eighties  With the emergence of the O's
and the Yanks it is far and away the best  While the NL West has the best
team in baseball and the Reds aren't bad either they have nothing else  The
Giants Astros and Padres all have talent they do not have the all arounf
teams that are found in the AL East  And the Dodgers just plain suck  As
for the Rockies who knows
   The AL East has the defending champs and although they lost a lot to
free agency Toronto is still one of the best in baseball  The Orioles have
the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina and you can never
forget about Ripken  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't
hurt to much either although I always liked Bill Ripken  While they let a
lot go this summer Randy Milligan Joe Orsulak Bill Ripken Bob Milacki Sam
Horn Storm Davis and Craig Lefferts they kept the heart of their team
intact

My predicted finish
 Baltimore Could be a biased opinion
 NY Yankees
 Toronto
 Milwaukee
 Detroit
 Boston
 Cleveland Would have been higher if not for the accident

briefly since i'm off to sleep

mle's work pretty well for AA nd AAA players

players who are  and younger will tend to have explosions
 in their numbers whether mMLE's or not in the next  years

players who are  and OLDER at those levels generally have
 inflated MLE's

they're about as reliable as having major league stats for a player

Ok all you trivia buffs I have a good one for you

  Prior to the foul bunt rule what is the record for the most foul balls
by  batter during one at bat

  Total pitches

  Who was the batter

  Who was the pitcher

  Same as  except after the foul bunt rule

Associated data would be nice too such as date location teams etc

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases  What competition did 
Alomar have  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken and the same year as Boggs
Gwynn and the other magicians  So less attention was given to Sandberg 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre  Besides the 
numbers don't count  National league pitchers are much better pitchers 

You're right Thomas Gonzalez Sheffield and Griffey don't even begin
to compare with Ripken Boggs and Gwynn so no wonder Alomar gets so
much attention

Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
terrible  So was his sophomore year

National League pitchers are much better pitchers  That certainly explains
Sheffield's  hm  Are you confusing have ERA's that are  lower
because they don't face DH's with much better

I was watching Peter Gammons on ESPN last night and he's got me a little
confused

While talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit
from the fringe players they'll be facing McGriff hitting  home runs
Sheffield getting  rbi's and Glavine winning  games  This was
of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball
has expanded early 's late 's late 's

What really confused me though was the mention of AL players who would
do well next year  Specifically Roger Clemens winning  games and the
likes of McGwire and Gonzalez hitting  home runs

My question is  How in the hell will the RockiesMarlins help the AL  The
last time I looked there wasn't a lot of talent jumping leagues  Did I
miss something

Only if you persist in believing that Peter Gammons is more knowledgable about
baseball than the average mailbox  Okay I'm overstating  Still the man 
actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this
year did not pitch in the majors last year

Huh

IMO this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the 
other expansion drafts had since the talent was diluted over both leagues
In Gammons' defense because the talent drain came from the AL as well some
increase will be seen  He also gets credit for mentioning that the  jump
in offense was due also to the rules changes after the  season  He's still
full of it

 This is what Jackson looked like in  with everything converted
 to a neutral park on the basis of run production His equivalent
 average started at  in  was up to  in  and  in  So
 let us say he had established in his last two seasons a  level
 of play

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated  It appears that in
a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two
home runs  Or do they  What is equivalent average

One thing when looking at Bo's stats is that you can see that KC took
away some homers  Normally you expect some wouldbe homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway  But Bo despite his speed 
hit very few doubles and not that many triples  So I would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park  

 That is good Very good in fact But it probably doesn't make the top
 ten in the league The th best EQA in the AL in  was Dave
 Winfield's  Thomas was first at  First in the NL was Bonds
 an incroyable  tenth was Bip Roberts  But  is better
 than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter it is about what
 Mattingly had in   what Felix Jose had the last two years
 just ahead of Time Raines' fiveyear average better than Ryan
 Klesko's MLEs 

Felix Jose has been a  player in a fairly neutral park
I would offhand guess the  Bo at around a  player
Maybe    Not even close

 He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
 baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his hitting
 That is the basis for the netcomments about him being overrated The
 media would have you beleive he was a great hitter I think he was a
 good maybe very good hitter He was IMO something like the th best
 hitter in the majors

I'd put him about there too  

Note I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much  I thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player and only soso 
at baseball  He did only have one hr rbi season and KC wasn't
winning

Note  I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a
mistake being made by the SDCN's as they are known on this group
with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton and perhaps others

We find that if you look at a large group of players their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well
Their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction
the lower the minor league the less good I imagine the more recent
the player has left college ball etc

Now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of error  Sometimes
a player with poor MLE's Dave Justice the  Ventura becomes a star
Some hitters develop Shane Mack Brian Downing some don't Oddibe
McDowell Mickey Brantley  This error involves real things there are
real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did  It may who knows
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on

But still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well
One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players  One thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing
ball  Their backgrounds are similar

What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background  Is there some reason to believe that a
Bo or a Deion or a Lofton or a Tony Gwynn  or an Ainge or so
on has such a different background that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly

It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with twosport players
It hasn't been established that you can't but then statistics is after
all an art  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton
Look at those goodbutnotgreat minor league numbers they say  Well
what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean
It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than
Tuscon  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better halfyear in
Atlanta than Greenville  

Then again it might not  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank
this year live up to those poor MLE's  But you guys DON'T KNOW  What's 
worse you don't know that you don't  And you don't know that there are 
other players you won't know about  injuries and lifting and wheaties 
again  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal  It's not
It's got some error

Oh well

i've said the braves would improve by injury as well  here's how

javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson
ryan klasko is a better firstbaseman than bream
 chipper jones is a better shortstop than anyone the braves
 put out there

mel nieves is better than nixonsanders

that's how it FORCES them to play the young guys

 bob gaj
 
 I continue to be amazed at these comments  While Lopez might some
 day be a better catcher than Olson I find it totally amazing for
 you to suggest that this  yearold with three seasons of professional
 baseball is now better than Olson a fiveyear MLB veteran who is
 noted for his ability to call a game and who has a betterthanaverage
 arm  Oh perhaps you are talking about hitting  Well sure Lopez
 might hit better  Perhaps he probably will
 
 But has there ever in the history of baseball been a yearold or
 younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
 catchers in terms of defense and brought a  bat  Wasn't it 

Yes Ivan Rodriguez last year  Batted  and threw out  of the
baserunners  Not too shabby for a rookie from AA   years old last
year

 Sandy Alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year
 Not  Wasn't it Benito Santiago who was supposed to be that good
 in his rookie year  Not
 
 I can continue this thread with the others mentioned but you get
 the point  You and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the 
 seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies  Perhaps 
 just perhaps  the management team of the pennantwinning Braves
 knows something more than you do  And perhaps what they know is
 that very very few  and year old rookies come up to the majors
 and make an impact

	Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor
uniform change per season but the past few seasons have been
incredible
	Any thoughts on the new old Reds uniforms  I
remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card and unless I miss my
guess he was wearing the exact same duds  
	The Mets HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY have
reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder and changed the Mets
insgnia on the front of the jersey  To my knowledge it is the
first time that has been changed since  and it reminds me
a little of the Dodger logo  

As far as I know Toronto Pittsburgh and New York NL change their
uniforms every year  Every other year eg New York it will say Mets
in cursive New York in cursive or New York in all caps  Minor changes
but they do change them often  Last year I think they had New York in all
caps  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year  What about
Pittsburgh

	Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform or at least uniforms that look more traditional
Phillies Reds Expos White Sox Padres etc and the once
bright colors have been altered to gray  The trend has also
seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
early years as opposed to the cookiecutter saucer stadiums
construcrted throughout the sixties

I hate the gray  They should opt for more color like the White Sox
I hate white team versus gray team  Spring training uniforms look much
better

	With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs no one
in the comissioner's office and interleague play on the
horizon it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it

Orioles vs Texas at Camden Yards April  Opening Day

Batting th for Texas playing Second Base

	BILLY  RIPKEN

The hometown crowd gave their favorite exnd Baseman a minute standing
ovation as Billy wearing flashy shades took the cheers smiling and
waving

	Consummate role player in the words of PA caller Jon Miller
Tim Hulett failed to receive similar cheers when announced  Mainly because
he didn't have the courtesy to show up

Wasn't Hulett injured yesterday after being hit in the face with a ball
while running bases  I heard something about him recieving stiches and a
possible broken nose  Is he at the park

	Fernando was warmly received good to see that

Let's see how they feel when he's  and  with a  ERA  I have my
doubts about Fernando

	FYI when Cal was announced Jon Miller says
	It seems like yesterday when this young manbegan a consecutive
game streak  time AllStar  time MVP  time gold glover our
future Hall of Fame shortsop batting rd Cal Ripken  The Standing O
lasted about  seconds   less than Billy  Blargh

Well when a fan favorite gets dumped he's gonna get an outstanding
ovation on his first return  Let's add up the ovations Cal has recieved
over the years during the game and compare that to Billy

BTW Sutcliffe's getting knocked around pretty good  Rangers up    in

And I thought Mota didn't really start pinchhitting for a

Depends on what you mean by for a living   was the year he led the
league in pinchhit at bats with  but he'd been getting a lot of PH ABs
earlier than that and was never a fulltime player   PH ABs early in
his career  a year just before going to the Dodgers and  in the
peak years

We're talking about a guy with a year career as an outfielder a 
career batting average and  or so career hits

As far as I know Toronto Pittsburgh and New York NL change their
uniforms every year  Every other year eg New York it will say Mets
in cursive New York in cursive or New York in all caps  Minor changes
but they do change them often  Last year I think they had New York in all
caps  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year  What about
Pittsburgh


     It depends on which uniforms you are talking about  For the last
couple of years I believe Toronto and Pittsburgh has used the same uniforms
or at least very similar  The home jerseys had the team nick name
Blue Jays or Pirates but the road jerseys had the name of the city
Toronto or Pittsburgh  I believe this is the way most teams design
their uniforms

I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others
to be interesting  Sorry this is after Opening Day  I certify that these
were completed before the first pitch 

AL East
  New York Yankees  the most only improved team in this division
  Toronto Blue Jays  Stewart and Morris  No way
  Milwaukee Brewers  they always seem to do better than I expect
  Baltimore Orioles  Pitching but Devareaux Anderson and Hoiles will drop
  Cleveland Indians  Still don't seem to know what they are doing
  Detroit Tigers  All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
  Boston Red Sox  Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than th

Al West  this division was the toughest for me to pick  Whoever of the top
           gets pitching should win it
  Minnesota Twins  young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
  Texas Rangers  I don't know why I have them here  Jose Canseco
  Chicago White Sox  Frank Thomas but no pitching
  Oakland A's  LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
  Seattle Mariners  I like Pinella but don't see much here
  Kansas City Royals  will score no runs
  California Angels  will win no games

NL East
  Montreal Expos  good all around plus no Wallach
  St Louis Cardinals  Jeffries  Whiten  Jose  Clark no Galarraga
  Pittsburgh Pirates  youngsters will take up more slack than expected
  New York Mets  some good players still not a team
  Philadelphia Phillies  they don't impress me
  Florida Marlins  they know what they're doing
  Chicago Cubs  they don't know what they're doing

NL West  The  best teams in baseball are in this division
  Atlanta Braves  Awesome starters but offense could be a concern
  Cincinnati Reds  Would not surprise me if they won it all
  Houston Astros  Any team that signs Uribe won't contend Closer to  than 
  San Diego Padres  Plantier could be the Sheffield of 
  Los Angeles Dodgers  better pitching than the Giants
  San Francisco Giants  because the Rockies just stink
  Colorado Rockies  will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL


NLCS  Montreal d Atlanta  Braves fans yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment
ALCS  New York d Minnesota

World Series  New York d Montreal  Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP  Barry Bonds or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young  Jose Rijo
AL MVP  Frank Thomas will deserve it again but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young  Roger Clemens at least will deserve it again

We know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact
in the bigs especially when they haven't even played AAA ball  

Yes  But this is irrelevant  You're talking about averages when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on

I might as well say We know that very very few people are more than  feet
tall so chances are that Manute Bol is really only  foot 

No  Maybe I need to improve my writing skills  Lopez who is very
ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age 
having not played at AAA level that it is probably not a good idea
to rush him into the Braves lineup in 

Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well  He hit that well last year after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an
absolute scale than Olson or Berryhill did  By a lot

As for rushing  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and I don't
believe there is then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's year old good
season than his year old very good season or his yearold excellent
season  The sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to
use

Lopez was hitting  over  AB when he was cut from spring
training  What does he have to do to earn a chance  Maybe not a full
time job but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove
his worth

Gee  I don't know   abs sounds pretty good to me  About as good
as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather
than start every day at AAA  Talk about me as a GM

The point was not that  AB is a significant sample but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him
down until he gets warmed up

OK  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age  

Most players are never ready for the bigs  What does this have to do
with Javy Lopez

Most players 
benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at AAA

See above  

Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their
clubs in the bigs  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the
Braves for this year

But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds  Most
players aren't that good so they probably won't be that good this year
either

Now  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out
runners  

And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble

Not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans

Not superstars not stars not even good players  Maybe average if we're
being charitable

The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the
outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid MVP candidate
at third and one of the better hitting shortstops  

Ummm  Justice is a very fine hitter  Pendleton might have another big year
in his bat but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell  Gant is a
big question mark  The BreamHunter platoon is decent not excellent and
has rotten OBP or SLG depending on who's in  Blauser is a very valuable
bat for a shortstop


The center
field platoon will probably hit   However good Lopez'
bat might be given the above it won't be so much better than
what they have to offset the differential in experience and 
defensive ability  

Wanna bet  The difference between Lopez's bat and OlsonBerryhill could be
 or  runs over the course of the season  Given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play I'll take the latter every time

The kid will improve playing at AAA 

Just like Keith Mitchell did

I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out  My 
goodness  Do you believe the other poster who thinks Lopez
is being held down because of his future earning potential

That was me and you so far your only counterproposal is that they
really don't understand how good Lopez is or overvalue experience
or some combination of the two  I think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization

Are they idiots who have built this ballclub

Well perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there  But they do have others worth playing at
least in their opinion  

Catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a wellaboveaverage offensive player and acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they
want to play Olson and Berryhill instead

I disagree in that I don't think it is a tangible skill any more than
leadership is  I don't deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers
may be much better than others at it but I really don't see any way that we
could ever know who they are  Nichols's Law of Catcher Defense is eerily
accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very
seriously

Sorry  New  Don't know Nichols' Law  

A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
 recent offensive level of performance  Thus Mickey Tettleton goes in
 the media from being a nohit defensive whiz to a slugging thumbfinger
 in two short years  The rule doesn't apply to perceived superstars who
 get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead  Greg Olson is probably
 considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit


Don't believe in catchers'
era  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers

Aren't they the same thing

In other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind 
a different decision than we would make must be financial  

Either that or just stupidity

I presume
we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta no

Of course

Is it fair to the young players  No  Does it make organizational sense 
I think it does

Well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them
for their decisions  I mean please don't tell me how to run my
business  Especially when I'm being successful

One could make the same sort of argument in other cases  Pete Rose in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record was a huge gate attraction and national media
magnet  The Reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime
of Eric Davis  That may be good business but that doesn't mean I don't
loathe them for it

Well Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs   
Justice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first Get
ready for him to have a monster year He is now hitting the ball to
the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural 
power to right field and his good batting eye If he stays healthy
which he should his back is full strength this year he should
get over  RBI and close to  HR

In another note the Marlins got off to a good start beating the
Dodgers I believe the score was    but I'm not sure I wish
them and the Rockies well this year Hell I think it would be
funny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year

 Stay in school  You have a lot to learn
 
 Learn what  I know that  million dollars is A LOT of money  I  
know 
 Rickey Henderson doesn't have a career out of baseball  I know if  
he 
 didn't have baseball he wouldn't be making near the money he is  
now
 

And Michael Jackson Jack Nicholson and Bill Cosby wouldn't be 
making near as much money if they weren't entertainers So what's
your point

 I just don't understand how some athlete who only plays a sport  
for a 
 living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough
 
 If nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one  
hurting
 The A's will still win without him

Will they  You can't usually take away one of the team's best
players and still expect them to win  Or do you think the 
Pirates will continue to win without Barry Bonds

 
 Remeber many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their  
athletic 
 ability  NOTHING  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard  
working
 citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay

So Again Jack Nicholson gets paid much more than most hard
working citizens and much more than Rickey Henderson for that
matter 

 
 I don't have a problem with them making millions  My problem is  
when the
 say they aren't being paid enough when they already get   
millionalso
 their numbers get worse

The reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
start making the real big salaries late in their career when they
are on the decline There are exceptions of course Dave Parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
of that million up his nose

While I enjoy the trend towards the more classic style of uniform

uniforms  it should be remembered that one of the if not THE reason 
for the redesigning of uniforms especially hats re the new road all

For those of you who know who Bernie Brewer is he's back  The
team mascot if you will was given his walking papers a few years
ago but the fans voted him back last season and he will be perched
in the his familiar home in the outfield and will again slide down
into a barrel of beer when home runs are hit

That is great to hear I just may have to take a raod trip to Milwakee this year and see that again  Last time I saw Bernie Brewer was at the age of  and I am now  thanks for this post

One final note Bill Spiers is leading the Brewers with  RBI's in
exhibition play  Looks like he's bouncing back nicely from back
problems

Good to Bill is getting better form the limited coverage we get here in Iowa
I know that this will be a great season for the BREW CREW

Being a baseball fan and a fan of the above mentioned band I was
wondering if anyone could clue me in on whether the Dead or members
of sang the national anthem at todays Giant opener

I would imagine that it is a bit too early for anyone to know but
an answer would be greatly appreciated

It is my understanding that the Dead will sing the NA at the Giants
home opener on Mon  The Giants are opening today in St Louis

  Whenever a person is put on the day day or day 
 the person is on the list longer than the specificed time

  I've seen a person on the day for maybe  months last year I don't
 remember what

 I just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications

I believe we are down to two  the day and the day  I don't remember 
a day but rather a day  Anyways it's gone now  The period length 
is a minimum not a maximum  You can keep a guy on the day for as long 
as you want IF he's still certified as injured  The player must be 
periodically reevaluated to determine if he's still injured thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers  If you get someone qualified for the day 
that reduces the frequency of reevaluations  There is no longer I 
believe any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL  When 
there was you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists

We know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact
in the bigs especially when they haven't even played AAA ball  

Yes  But this is irrelevant  You're talking about averages when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on

Do you really have that much information on him  Really

Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well  He hit that well last year after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an
absolute scale than Olson or Berryhill did  By a lot

I don't know  You tell me  What percentage of players reach or 
exceed their MLE's in their rookie season  We're talking about
 you know


As for rushing  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and I don't
believe there is then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's year old good
season than his year old very good season or his yearold excellent
season  The sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to
use

If that were your purpose maybe  Offerman spent  getting 
acclimated if you will  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant


Lopez was hitting  over  AB when he was cut from spring
training  What does he have to do to earn a chance  Maybe not a full
time job but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove
his worth

The point was not that  AB is a significant sample but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him
down until he gets warmed up

For a stathead I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training  Did you notice who he got those   hits off of or
are you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference

The kid will improve playing at AAA 

Just like Keith Mitchell did

Wait a minute  I missed something here  First forget Keith
Mitchell  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA
and then does not improve would have been better off making a
direct leap to the majors  If a player does well at AA and then
does not improve at AAA isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't
belong in the bigs

Now Keith Mitchell  As I recall no stat books handy  surprise
he jumped from AA to Atlanta in   He did so well that he was
returned to the minors where he didn't do very well at all  Now
his career is in jeopardy  So how does he fit in with your 
point  Good MLE's in AA  Moved him right to the big club  Now
he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball
Duh


That was me and you so far your only counterproposal is that they
really don't understand how good Lopez is or overvalue experience
or some combination of the two  I think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization

Well I've cast my lot  Certainly you may understand better how 
good Lopez is  And I may overvalue experience  But neither one
of us runs a baseball team

 ARGH Here is where you are obviously dead wrong Not since the Yankees of
 the 's and 's has a team been so nicely setup as this yearsand years 
 to come Braves I don't think that the AllStar team will be able to beat 

This may be an appropriate comparison
The  Yankees finshed nd rd and nd finshing 
  and  games out of first 
In ' and ' they also finished second  though they were only
  and  games out
Even great teams can lose  That's why they play the season
on the other hand I'm still picking the Braves to go all the way


Um surely you didn't intend to compare the ' Reds with the
 Philidelphia A's  The Yankees were finishing nd to
a team that was as good as the  Yankees while the
Yankees had aged some from their peak years  Ruth and Gehrig
couldn't play every position simultaneously

IMO given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season
that the Braves will be closer to their peak while the Reds
have slightly passed their peak

Also if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees a more appropriate
comparison to the ' Braves might be the ' Yankees  
After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series
 both teams wonwill win the Series this year despite the
heroics of some old fart on the other team

proof But I have hope for the Marlins I was a sometime member of the

 Your speculation and

Your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better
than Lopez is also no more than speculation  It does make
a difference whether the speculation is wellfounded or not
  
Obviously the Braves believe they can win with the catching they
have and I agree  If they change their minds they'll call up Lopez

Though this is a good point  The one speculation is safer
because it can be reversed

Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of
approx  posts going back to The Braves could be better off
if an injury happens I may as well inject a little more
fuel to the flame

  Back at the beginning of Spring Training I though
Lopez would make the squad easily  Olson was still
recovering from his lateseason injury knee I believe
and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before June  And then Berryhill was dinged up

I was looking forward to this because I believe that Lopez
can hit AND field the position  Before last season he was
the Braves Defensive Catcher prospect while Brian Deak was
the Braves Offensive Catcher prospect  Besides Olson
and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box and don't walk enough to be useful

But Olson recovered quickly Berryhill recovered and the Braves went
with the two vets  I still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season he wouldn't have gotten his job back

  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around
After all ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher
California and Seattle come to mind  Certainly trying to
move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work
Plus you'd have to eat that salary which isn't huge but isn't
tiddleywinks either I think Olson's at about  Berryhill
at  but that's only what I recall

  Yes I think arbitrationeligibility may have a role to
play in this also  What is it that  of the year players
aren't eligible for arbitration   Only the  that were on the roster
the longest are eligible  Of course the system may change
but the extent of that change is not yet known  From a business
standpoint it may make sense to keep Lopez down until Junethe
first time OlsonBerryhill go on the DL

  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team
I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves
and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field
which IMO includes Lopez

Of coursetoday we play the Cubs  Hopefully we won't need him 

As for the SchuerholzCox conversation I imagine it went
like this  Remember they've BOTH been GM's
the following is not meant to be read by the humorimpaired

Cox  OK we've sent Jones down  His fielding could be a
little smoother  Besides Blauser can hit OK and his fielding
is better than it used to be

Schuerholz  Well we'll have to send Nieves down too  Deion
just won't sign that baseball only contract  We can't count
on him in October so we have to keep Nixon around for the
defense  Besides Gorman's not ready to give up on
Billy Hatcher yet  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs
we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez  That ought to
give us some pitching depth in 

Cox  Yep that'll be nice  Too bad Deion won't sign
OK I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having
BerryBerryer back problems again  Now what about
Klesko

Schuerholz  Well we've still got to fork out another  mil
for Bream  If we keep Klesko we either lose the money
or Cabrera  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell
but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM  First
Jeffries for Jose and now Whiten for Clark  If he
gets rid of Brian Jordan then I'd HAVE to believe that he
and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings

Cox  OK keep trying on Bream and I'll wait til the trading
deadline for my HunterKlesko platoon  Maybe I can get a few
extra atbats for Cabrera while we wait  Try California
if Snow starts slowly maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid
And if that doesn't work then perhaps Sid's knees
could be persuaded to act up  There's always the
day DL  Mwahahahaha

Schuerholz  What about Caraballo

Cox  Well he's not that much better than Lemke  Maybe if he starts
in Richmond he'll start walking more  Besides if he's going to be
arbitrationeligible better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks

Schuerholz  Now let's see  That leaves Lopez

Cox  NOOOOO  I gotta keep Lopez  Sure I didn't think Olson
would recover this quickly  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into
running into him again

Schuerholz  Nope Lopez has gotta go  You know that he'll get
 million in arbitration  May as well put it off that one
extra year  Besides until Olson's shown his stuff a little
bit I can't trade him  Besides Berryhill's a lefthanded
hitter  You know how rare that is

Cox  Don't you mean a lefthanded whiffer  Pretty common
if you ask me  I mean he made Pat Borders look good in
the World Series  PAT BORDERS

Schuerholz  Hey you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez
into the lineup

Cox  Well you're the one who went out and got me Jeff

 Even less publicized than this however was that the

I should be so lucky the account number must have been rejected 

Oh come on  Everybody on the net has heard about plausible deniability
You're not fooling anybody

 Soon after that Gray and Palmer sent word to Ottawa that Canada had
 achieved absolute superiority over the United States in the field of
 baseballistic research as she controlled both the AckerCook

I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict
the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubshow

First Base

Grace vs DestradeCould Destrade be the second coming of Cecil
Fielder I doubt it If Destrade performs to the height of expectations
then even otherwise edge to Cubs

Second Base

Sandberg vs BarberieNo contest Sandberg will be back May  Edge
to Cubsa big edge

Shortstop

Vizcaino vs WeissVizcaino is excellent defensively but is an
automatic out at bat Weiss isn't much better with the stick Even

Third Base

Dave Magadan vs BuechelleMagadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter
Buechelle has more power and is better defensively I think Edge to
Florida

Catcher 

Santiago vs WilkinsWilkins is OK but Santiago is better Edge to
Marlins

Left Field

Conine vs MaldonadoWow  for  yesterdayI know Conine has potential
I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years Until he actually proves
himself I give Maldonado the edge however like at B this is position
where Florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year

Center

Scott Pose vs WilsonMayEdge to May even if Wilson Hopefully the
Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like May
isn't Ken Griffey Jr but he will hit  with  homers if he plays
full time

Right

Felix vs SosaFelix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP So does
Sosa but Sosa also has speed and a good glove Edge to Cubs

Starters

Aquino Armstrong Hammond A lot of fifth starters here The Cubs won't
remind anyone of the Brave staff but MorganCastilloGuzmanHibbard
is average to OKbetter than the Marline Edge to Cubs

Middle Relief

Even The Cubs have some decent middlemen and so do the Marlins
Carpenter anf Klink or decent but so are Assenmacher and McElroy

Closer

A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins Meyers is decent but
no Harvey Of course the Cubs may have a few more games to save
Look for  saves  blown from Meyers and  saves  blown with
a better ERA for Harvey Edge Florida

Overall an edge to Chicago
Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything of course

How many runs will be scored in Denver
I don't know

but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in 
Mile High Stadium during the last few years of the BearsZephyrs 
tenure in the American Association

Here's the total runs scored per game in Zephyrs games 
all league games and the ratio I found the same ratios for HR

Year  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   
         
          
         
          
          
        
           
          
           
         
        
          
         
           

It seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect 
on runs scored I'll stick with my prediction from last year 
that it'll be one of the top  in the NL this year 
and a fairly large effect on Homeruns  though apparently not as large as 
Atlanta Wrigley Cincinnati and San Diego
Still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park

  ARGH Here is where you are obviously dead wrong Not since the Yankees 
  of the 's and 's has a team been so nicely setup as this yearsand 
  years to come Braves I don't think that the AllStar team will be able  
 This may be an appropriate comparison
 The  Yankees finshed nd rd and nd finshing 
   and  games out of first 
 In ' and ' they also finished second  though they were only
   and  games out
 Even great teams can lose  That's why they play the season
 on the other hand I'm still picking the Braves to go all the way

 Um surely you didn't intend to compare the ' Reds with the
  Philidelphia A's  The Yankees were finishing nd to
 a team that was as good as the  Yankees while the
 Yankees had aged some from their peak years  Ruth and Gehrig
 couldn't play every position simultaneously
 
 IMO given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season
 that the Braves will be closer to their peak while the Reds
 have slightly passed their peak
 
 Also if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees a more appropriate
 comparison to the ' Braves might be the ' Yankees  
 After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series
  both teams wonwill win the Series this year despite the
 heroics of some old fart on the other team 
 Casey Stengel Dave Winfield

Perhaps so I was only responding to the Yankees of the 's and 's 
part of the comment If those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost 
then it's probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another 
team not that I did

In article bluecispittedu geneticpittedu David M Tate writes
mssnetcomcom Mark Singer said

We know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact
in the bigs especially when they haven't even played AAA ball  

Yes  But this is irrelevant  You're talking about averages when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on

Do you really have that much information on him  Really

I don't personally but Clay just posted it  Yes we do  

Unfortunately it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would
have been since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years which I didn't have access to

The point remains though knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history if you know how to read it

Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well  He hit that well last year after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an
absolute scale than Olson or Berryhill did  By a lot

I don't know  You tell me  What percentage of players reach or 
exceed their MLE's in their rookie season  We're talking about
 you know

The MLE is not a projection it's an equivalence  It's a this is how
well he hit last year in major league terms rating  So in essence he
has already reached it  I would guess Bob  Clay that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons  Maybe
more than half since all of these players are young and improving

If that were your purpose maybe  Offerman spent  getting 
acclimated if you will  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season  

Did they  Offerman may have been the difference between th or th place
and last place but no more

Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant

Sure they didn't have anyone better  I suppose they might have gutted the
farm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really
in contention 

The point was not that  AB is a significant sample but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him
down until he gets warmed up

For a stathead I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training  

If you'd read what I wrote you'd be less amazed  Nowhere do I claim to put
any credence in spring training  Quite the contrary I said that Lopez hadn't
done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training
could interpret as failure  Just because I think spring training numbers
are meaningless doesn't mean that Bobby Cox does it's just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending Lopez down

The kid will improve playing at AAA 

Just like Keith Mitchell did

Wait a minute  I missed something here  

Keith Mitchell did very very well at AA AAA and the majors over a season
then did very very poorly for a year in AAA

Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate
with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times
My opinion FWIW to all

Mark age doesn't matter ability does I would rather have the untried
rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven
himself to be average at best I don't care if he is  if he plays
better than what I have I want him out there Sandy Alomar had decent
minor league numbers grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las
Vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter which is good for a catcher I'll admit Santiago's
numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's but I don't have
the league data from the mids to check it out

That being said I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond at least to
start the season As the box below shows he has one minor league
season in which he hit well He has two in which he hit very very
poorly I want to see that the  Lopez is real Olson and Berryhill
are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially NL catchers

 If he had hit well at prior levels I would say he belongs on
the Braves but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was
just as much a fluke as Alomar in  or Santiago in  One year at
any level at any age doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence

On a similar note I don't understand why more people are not
supportive of Neon Deion Granted I thought his behavior with
McCarver last year was completely bush Last year was the first time
he ever got  AB in one place so his lines are hard to read But he
has a combined  OPS in minor league play with his speed is more
valuable than the OPS alone indicates and at a still young age 
had a monster year with an  OPS He has a total major and minor
EQA of  above major league average and above average for CF
which was about  in the NL last year He has shown at least the
potential of going into the s which would make him one of the 
best hitters in the league He has two full seasons before reaching
his prime season of  He should be considered as a legitimate
prospect and not as a simple sideshow attraction

 Of course the protected list was done by the OLD regime not the new so
 this is Rosen's baby not Quinn's
 
 And I'll tell you what Let's look at this again at the end of the season
 and say in three years and see who the genius is One of the more
 braindead decisions by the OldGiants IMHO Even if Benjamin DOES improve
 markedly over the past and his hitting is better he's never going to be
 more than a utilitybackup IF Rapp might turn into a topflight arm in
 another year

I think the next time I post something like this I obviously need to make
the sarcasm a bit more obvious

Did anyone notice the words NOT FOR BASEBALL printed on the picture
of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA
Today Any reason given for this

Also I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in
the preview On  Rickey Henderson became Nolan's th strikeout
On  he pitched his th nohitter against Oakland I believe the
last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson And on  Nolan
pitched his th nohitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
th base which overshadowed it It seems that Nolan is having a lot of
publicity at Rickey's expense IMO Rickey deserves it and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately They are
both great players but IMO Nolan has outclassed Rickey both in playing
and more importantly in attitude Just my thoughts

As for rushing  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and I don't
believe there is then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's year old good
season than his year old very good season or his yearold excellent
season  The sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to
use

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors let's for
argument's sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age  or younger and performing below
expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing  I'm serious I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work if there are
any  I'd prefer players within the last  years or so because then I can
look up their minor league stats  It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected as opposed to players who were hyped and failed but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers  

Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career  Jay Bell was
given  PAs in the major leagues at age  and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season  He got  PAs the
next year at age  and still underperformed  However the next year at
age  his performance improved and he won the everyday shortstop job
and has been there ever since  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league where he was
performed quite well in AAA during this time rather than being rushed
Cleveland might have been better off I suppose because they might have
been less likely to give up on him

Yes if you bring a player up early he's likely going to struggle  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling and starts
performing up to expectations

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues
The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis as they
had little talent on their roster for some time  Steve Avery for example
was rushed to the majors and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign
His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his  ERA during his rookie
year  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
and then rebound

Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors out of Arizona State directly had
good numbers immediately

I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith Craig McMurty and
Derek Lilliquist  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
that they might have been rushed  Lilliquist and Smith struggled but it
didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped  I seem to recall CM pitching
well initially though I don't have stats handy

I just don't understand how some athlete who only plays a sport for a

If nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one hurting
The A's will still win without him

Remeber many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their athletic

I don't have a problem with them making millions  My problem is when the

their numbers get worse

Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their
clubs in the bigs  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the
Braves for this year

Now  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out
runners  

	This is the crux of the argument to me at least  Both the
SDCN and the nonSDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present  You can talk about how
important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls
in the dirt  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in defense  

	Looking at Lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher  As far as I
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
such as Sasser  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time  I can't see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors  

	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine  Similarly I wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez

	Now since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in AAA that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors

 	Kansas City	
 
 I think KC has a much better shot at being in the top division than
 the bottom One wordCone should help things tremendously I think
 you are way off the mark here

Another word offense makes them my pick for last too
Well there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last

 	Florida		
 	Chicago		
 
 I dont know if an expansion team has ever finished not last but I think
 this year might be a first if it hasnt ever happened The Cubs are worse

The  Angels were   game out of th The Athletics and 
expansion Senators finished tied for last 
The  Colt 's finshed th  ahead of the Cubs the Mets were last
The  Royals finshed th  ahead of the White Sox the Pilots in last
The  Mariners finished th  ahead of the Athleticsin last

Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago 
team around is a good thing'

 National League West
 
 	Cincinnati      
 	Houston          
 	Atlanta          
 ARGH Here is where you are obviously dead wrong Not since the Yankees of
 the 's and 's has a team been so nicely setup as this yearsand years 
 to come Braves I don't think that the AllStar team will be able to beat 

This may be an appropriate comparison
The  Yankees finshed nd rd and nd finshing

In ' and ' they also finished second  though they were only
  and  games out
Even great teams can lose  That's why they play the season
on the other hand I'm still picking the Braves to go all the way

 	I totally agree with each point you made  Jose Viscaino looked
 like a single A hitter up there  Who swings on  count with Maddux 
 pitching and your teams down by a run and you haven't touched the ball

 Watching
 the Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about
 what
 the Cubs should be doing than Lefebre does  Harry said it best when he
 stated after another terrible Vizcaino at bat we can't wait til
 Sandberg returns

I tell you Steve Stone is like a prophet
He must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because
I can't understand why he's not actually back in the game itself

The other day he called Sosa's homerun against the Sox and
claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the
score was  in the th

So yesterday he notices that Sosa's ahead in the count against
Maddux and says This is a fastball situation and Sosa will be
looking for it  But this is also the spot where Maddux throws
the straight change   Sure enough Sosa gets ahead on it and pops
it up to the infield

his career is in jeopardy  So how does he fit in with your

he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball
Duh

Methinks you recall wrong Mitchell hit close to  in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion He was then I think left
off the playoff roster and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down 

he struggled last year no doubt but even the Braves blamed part of it

I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an OriolesRed Sox game in  
Baltimore on Saturday July st  I haven't been to the new park
and I was wondering if anyone out there can give me pointers or good tips  
or anything helpful about the place so that I can enjoy every moment spent
there
For instance what time do the gates open  Do we see the Orioles take BP
When will the Red Sox take BP  Anything you can tell me would be 
appreciated  Thank you in advance 
Please respond to my email address
I know it's still threeandahalf months away but I'm psyched

And Michael Jackson Jack Nicholson and Bill Cosby wouldn't be 
making near as much money if they weren't entertainers So what's
your point

Actually I could care less what his salary is  It has something to do
with the fact that we live in America and everyone is entitled to
whatever he can legally obtain  If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family
willingly negotiate a salary of  million per year with Rickey I couldn't
care less

But what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training
about Well sometimes I may not play as hard or might be hurt more
often in a place where I'm not appreciated'  This quote was in the Chronicle
about the second week of camp and strongly suggests that he was going to 
dog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up some
more money  For God's sake Rickey you signed a contract  years ago
now honor it and play  

Say all you want to about Steve Garvey and believe
me I hated him too but at least when he put his signature on a piece
of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up

Having run completely out of time I've got to get my prophesies and
predictions for the AL out  Qualifications  one of the worse
finishes in last year's prediction contest

AL East  

  Baltimore Orioles
Why the Orioles  Well I pondered long and hard and it all came down to
this
   The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction
   Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees
   Milwaukee was a fluke
   Indians aren't ready to contend
   Red Sox were bad last year and didn't get any better
   Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of replacement level
But you don't really think the Orioles will win do you  No  As a matter
of fact I can't see any team in the American League winning either division
on paper with the possible exception of the Yankees who I hate  But some
body has to win so I pick the Orioles  You don't really think that Brady
Anderson is going to repeat do you  No  I'm basing the Orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis  Glenn
Davis  That's insane  Yes  So without further ado
STRONG POINTS  Hoiles Ripken some years Olson getting rid of Billy Ripken
WEAK POINTS  Segui may start  Valenzuela the original something may be
  the fifth starter  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup
  Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
  the effect of a slumping Ripken  If you can't move Ripken out of the 
  spot why not move the rest of the line up
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN  In a tight pennant race team trades for Pecota
ObPrediction  The Streak continues  Harold Reynolds leads the team in
  caught stealing

 New York Yankees
STRONG POINTS  Abbot Key Perez  Could have best pitching in American
  League  Boggs should improve on Hayes
WEAK POINTS  Mattingly still considered best hitter  The Steinbrenner 
  factor  The Yankees lost to the Mets  Can wholesale changes be far
  behind  Never count on rookie pitchers ie Wickman  Millitello to
  win a division
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN  Boggs hits over 
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN  Howe gets arrested again
ObPrediction  Mattingly won't top a  OPS

  Toronto Blue Jays
STRONG POINTS  Management willing to make big deals  Management has eerie
  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects  Olerud
  Guzman  Alomar
WEAK POINTS  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick
  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation that's really a bad sign  No one in
  the outfield can get on base  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN  Club makes no major deals in August
ObPrediction  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year  And
  have a losing record

  Milwaukee Brewers
STRONG POINTS  Pitching staff was exceptional  last year
WEAK POINTS  Molitor gone  Surhoff at third  Why  Eldred can't keep it up
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN  Listach and Eldred play like last year
WOULD BE BAD SIGN  Bones plays like last year
ObPrediction  Surhoff won't finish the year at third

  Cleveland Indians
STRONG POINTS  Baerga Belle Nagy
WEAK POINTS  Pitching staff thin  losing Olin really hurts  Starts Felix
  Fermin
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN  Ted Power  bullpen ace
ObPrediction  Alomar will be back on the DL by the allstar break

  Boston Red Sox
STRONG POINTS  Clemens Viola Clemens Detroit Clemens
WEAK POINTS  Most incompetent GM in baseball  Key free agent signing  Andre
  Dawson  Burks is gone  Hatcher in center
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN  Rainouts in between Clemens starts
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN  Clemens on the DL
ObPrediction  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon  Interpret that how
  you will 

  Detroit Tigers
STRONG POINTS  Tettleton Phillips Whitaker
WEAK POINTS  If Fielder keeps declining he'll be a shortstop this year
  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced  but not necessarily better
  This year could be very ugly
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP
ObPrediction  Cecil won't lead the league in RBIs

One more division to go

You'd think that an expansion team would be filled with young'ns not guys
like Murphy Galaragga B Smith

It depends  If you can get your old veterans cheap and if they can perform
at a higher level than your young talent can now why not the talent 
develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer
If the veterans are gone in a year or two  that should be just about right

Maybe someone should tell those renegade front office people in Denver 

Open question  which was more important to the expansion clubs the expansion
draft or the regular draft  They've had one of each I think

I don't know if you could call him rushed but Big Ben McDonald didn't
much time at all in the minors Of course that was because the balls used
in AAA had seams too large and gave McDonald blisters forcing him to go
on the DL several times He's done most of his learning here in the majors
Of course Gregg Wild Thing Olson and Mike Deserved a Cy Young Mussina
didn't spend much time in the minors either I read somewhere that pitchers
are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that
has something to do with it

I was watching the DodgersMarlins game yesterday and a couple of
things impressed me  

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami it had a summer
atmosphere in early spring for baseball  In comparison Wrigley Field
in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and
bundled up fans  

The second and most important was the fans  I like these guysgals
I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball
It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins  The way they were cheering I thought it was the
AFC playoffs  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it
but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities  

Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion
teams bring back some excitement  We'll find out Friday how Denver
Bronco fans respond 

Phillies are  I better say it now before my opportunity passes

I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the
Expos in  that decided the NL East  It was also his career high
th 

Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the
 ALCS  The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox  strike away from
the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run
That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in
baseball  The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same
thing done to them in the WS against the Mets  Speaking of the METS
isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST
mirrored the  NLCS with the Phillies  The Astros have been
painfully close twice I must admit

This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary  VERY
scary  Don't get me wrong Im a Phillies fan but as late as last
year they looked helpless  The funny thing was they did have a lot
of injuries in ' spring training that basically killed their
chances  Of course don't forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the
first or second game

 reference to history because he certainly didn't have the best season for

 Alomar last year
   
 What  Do you have some measure like popularity in Toronto doesn't count
 that you are basing this statement on
 
 Uh yes  Baerga has a lot of flash but Alomar was the better hitter
 last year

This is fascinating  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last 
year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga
had a better year  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP

Every single piece of evidence we can find points to Major League Baseball
being  offense  defense  A run scored is just as important as a run
prevented  

 This certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any
 statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what
 percent is fielding  I'd really like to know  BTW Sherri thanks for 
 the DA data I find it fascinating

Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented
Just as a penny saved is a penny earned  Enough with the cliches
My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to
their potential they won't need much offensive support
I realize this is a BIG IF  This staff leaves the ' BoSox in the dust
There is no legitimate comparison  Two Cy Young winners and three other
pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
or second starter  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound the other teams score less runs  The team that scores the most 
runs wins  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves  They should have many 
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting
On the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players
I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers
They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
opponent  The name of the games is to win  Even Ray Knight knows that
you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard
All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
like the Braves have the offense doesn't need to be as strong

Davis will be paid by three clubs this year I think the Phils are
responsbible for about  or so  They didn't wait for him to clear
waivers as three other clubs were also very interested in him  A gamble
Yes

 Oh it will  As a Royals fan I am skeptical  They say he pitched well
 in winter ball  He also pitched well at Omaha while with KC  He just
 didn't pitch well or even acceptably when in the majors  I don't have
 his Atlanta stats but he must not have impressed them very much either

What about the year when he got  saves in San Diego did he pitch well
then  Ok I know he was awful the next year when he went to KC but still

Won the CY Young too for that year

This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary  VERY
scary  Don't get me wrong Im a Phillies fan but as late as last
year they looked helpless  The funny thing was they did have a lot
of injuries in ' spring training that basically killed their
chances  Of course don't forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the
first or second game

First game first at bat

What I think is hotdogish about his AB's is the way he leans out over
the plate to watch outside pitches etc This not done to get a better
look at the pitch but to make it seemthis ball is so far out I need
to lean just to get near it so you better call it a ball This is my
unbiased opinion of what I see Your mileage will vary
Rickey is agreat player to watch if you forget who he is at the time

a lot of batters lean in when pitches come  rickey's crouch tends
to exaggerate that i think

a great player to watch if you forget who he is  unbiased hmmm

Rogers is the onebatter lefty in the bullpen  Dusty has also said he
trusts Rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where Beck is
unavailable so you might see a couple of saves for Kevin  Then again if
any of the regular rotation falters Rogers is a possible candidate to
start though this would appear less likely now that Dave Burba did well
in an emergency start

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers

Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  What the Hell
is he thinking

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench  Gilkey hit over  last year
what does he have to do to start The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league

Furthermore in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate 
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home 

I can't take this anymore

Let's see April th less than  at bats and you claim that he 
hasn't done too much so far

Cut this guy some slack Danny will produce this year It's scary to think
just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year

The Yanks have a lot going for them this year good starting rotation good
bullpen good defense and a good lineup Also I like Buck Showalter Frank
Howard on st is also a good move Everything sounds good so far 

If the Yanks stay healthy they have a good chance at winning the pennant This 
is the most fun I've had watching the Yanks since

You all know how things turned out  The Orioles Red Sox and Yankees
all disappeared  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half

The Rangers predictably took a dive  That shouldn't have surprised
anybody  Meanwhile as predicted the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals  They clearly didn't deserve the  record in
June  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit while the Twins
dropped off a little  But for the most part things were as expected

Okay so there were a few blatant errors  But for a predictive
calculation I thought this did pretty well


From CAVGEOEYaleVMYCCYaleEdu Tue Mar   
 The Braves insert Kent Mercker into the starting rotation
sometime this year   Bielecki is traded or released Lei
brandt becomes the fifth starter and the best bullpen in baseball
has Pena Berenguer Stanton Wohlers Freeman and Pete Smith who
spotstarts as well

Hm  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker  And Bielecki
wasn't released until the end of the year  I won't comment on the
bullpen  Jeff Reardon  

 Blauser wins the starting shortstop job outright by the end
of May  Bream goes on the DL and Klesko goes on a nice hitting
honeymoon a la Gregg Jefferies in  platooning with Hunter
Mitchell wins the center field job a bit later AllStar break and
Nixon stays on as a valuable pinchrunner  Lonnie is released unless
the Braves find a taker in a trade

Right on Blauser  Wrong on Bream and Mitchell  A bit early on
Lonnie as with Bielecki  Didn't pick Sanders  Did anybody 

 Managers to be fired this year  in chronological order
Fregosi Showalter Valentine Riddoch

Three of them went right  Showalter is still around and likely to
stick it seems



From mattelAutotrolCOMmattelautotrolcom Tue Mar   
 Bonds gets traded from Bucs for some young talent

Nope  They won the division and so kept him for a shot at the
playoffs

 Mets win division

  Well they didn't finish last

 Atlanta repeats in the West

Got that one right

 Yankees surprise everyone but finish second behind Toronto

Nope

 Dwight Gooden wins  but is surpassed by Saberhagen who wins 

I guess this is why you picked the Mets to win huh

 Roger Clemens is injured early in the season

Tsk Tsk  Not nice to predict something like this

 Strawberry fails to hit even  home runs and is often injured
 Due to  Dodgers drop out of race

You got that right



And my response

From tedward Tue Mar   

Hmph  Can tell you are a Mets fan  Do you mind if I make some counter
predictions against yours  They follow
 Mets come in third behind Pittsburgh and Montreal

Okay so the Mets finished fifth  But I got the Pirates and Expos
right

 The Yankees offense and pitching flounders dropping them to fourth
   place in the AL East  Boston wins  games the division the pennant
   and the World Series

First half  Dead on  Second half  Ummm  I'm a Sox fan go easy
on me

 Dwight Gooden rushes his comeback gets blown out and goes on the DL from
   May through midJuly
   Saberhagen runs a  record WFAN criticizes the Mets for giving away
   that great talent Jefferies who has a solid year in KC

So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed    I
was at least close and was right about Jefferies  Though I don't
know  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade

      OPS Projected for 
                              HoJo 
 
 I will streak naked down Forbes avenue if HoJo does not muster more than
 a  OPS  Something is wrong with that projection

Some predictions need no introduction



From navarracasbahacnsnwuedu Mon Apr

Do you care to put your prediction down for posterity  You predict
Mark Grace will get  RBIs  I say you are out of your mind  That
is almost impossible for a HR type guy batting behind Dawson  Who
kills most of the rallies he doesn't finish

	Why do you say that Mark has driven in  ' and  '
Last year Mark was batting second primarily and it was his worse year
average wise Since he is batting either rd or th this year I predict 
he will be back up to his previous standards I think he will be better
 rbi's is not that much of a stretch

Sometimes us statheads get lucky  Grace didn't hit behind Dawson
the entire season but he also finished with only  RBIs



From nssmidwayuchicagoedu Tue May   

The most ballsy prediction ever

Mark McGwire will hit  or more HRs this year

Nope  He slowed down and the injury finished him off  Didn't
even reach   But a ballsy prediction nonetheless



From ECAXRONMARSLERCNASAGOV Thu May   
 Baltimore will not fade  They will not win the division this year
    but they will finish within five games  I find the prospect of two
    Orioles winning  each easier to comprehend than that of two Sox
    No offense  I think their pitching is about as good as the division
    has to offer

The Orioles finished seven games out  None of them won  though
Mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts

 Nobody else in the division is worth a darn  They all finish a minimum
    of fifteen games out the Tribe   That's another reason to watch
    Baltimore this year and next  they won't waste many of those games 
    against the rest of the division

Except for the Brewers who you probably forgot you were right  The
rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre  The Yankees and Indians
led with  wins the Red Sox trailed with  wins  None were
horrible but four were five or more games below 


From djohnsoncayleyuwaterlooca David Johnson
Date Thu  Aug   GMT

Right  That was me  I never said the Jays were a cinch to clinch it
but I said that Milwaukee will be more of a threat than Baltimore  I
do think that Toronto should win it but after ' I don't consider
anything a cinch unless you have something like a  game lead with 
games to go  I do think that the Jays have the best talented team in
the AL East and if we had a good or even average manager we might
have a bigger lead right now  I also think that the Orioles will not
play much better than  baseball for the rest of the season

You win



From kingcogsciUCSDEDU Thu Nov   

In article Novcscornelledu you write
 Indians	the first and only  season ever  

Prediction  The Cleveland indians will win  or more games next year

You were right



From stvjasmeteorwiscedu Fri Sep   

 Jose Rijo will win the  Cy Young award IF he is healthy enough to go
at least  IP Who would have thought he would try to steal a base Why
risk such an injury

He had  IP but didn't win the Cy Young  Maddux surprised all

 The Orioles will win  games in at least  of the next  years
probably the last  and their pitching staff will have a team ERA
among the best  in the AL in at least  of the next  years but not
necessarily all the same years as they win  This one will take a
long time to verify

I don't think I want to wait that long  But they won  games last
year and they were fifth in the league in ERA  Not a bad start

 Ben McDonald will not challenge for an ERA title in the next 
years nor will he have  victories either year By challenge I
mean FINISH among the leaders being among the leaders BEFORE the
season is done doesn't count  He will probably never be the pitcher
he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to have

Looks like it  He wasn't bad last year just too consistent to be an
ace  So far this year looks like more of the same

 The Phillies will give up many fewer walks ifwhen they get rid of their
bullpen coach Ryan I am not predicting when or whether they will get rid
of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust 
before seeing the radical change They would have a fine pitching staff if 
they would just steal Ray Miller away from Pittsburg The White Sox seem to
have the same problem but not as bad

I honestly can't say  Did they get rid of him  Their BB totals were
down last year

 Ricky Jordan will have  rbi IF he starts  games hitting in
the  or  or  spot in any lineup or the  spot in a lineup with very
good OBP in the  hitters This applies for each of the next 
years

I just don't think he's that good

 Billy Ripken will never again hit over  with  AB

  So far so good  I'm definitely not waiting to check this one



From panixspiracmclNYUEDU Fri Sep   

No matter what Lou Gorman and his scouts say Paul Quantrill will
never ever be an adequate major league starter  Never  I have never
seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out  per  innings at AAA
be successful in the majors

Current plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief  He has a
rubber arm and unusual delivery  He might be decent in that role

intentional  Okay so I exaggerate  But I might have been right



From trnstrdevjhuapledu Tue Mar   

 Are the O's going to sign Cal of is Eli's wallet welded shut outgoing 
 money only wide open for incoming cash 

My prediction which you may make note of Valentine   is that Eli Jacobs
will defer any serious negotiations on Cal Ripken's contract until the '
season is over  Eli will give Cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble
a bit from last year's pace before coming forth with an offer

Despite claims that OPCY was designed to Cal's strength my feeling is that
the  foot leftcenter canyon will cut down on Cal's power stats

After all it's hard to credibly to offer  millionyear to an
AllStar game MVPAL MVPGold Glove shortstopbaseball deity  
but it'd be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an obviously
declining but above average shortstop who had a career year one full
season ago

Of course if Cal does match his ' numbers then Eli is going to be faced
with a rather huge and expensive problem

How much did Cal sign for  When did he sign  If I remember
correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season



And finally

From jpalmeruwovaxuwoca Thu Sep   

Generally because of expansion in  there will be a lot of
mediocre talent hanging around Much of it will not make it as the
expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their
teams My specific predictions

As of April  

Jim Acker and Cory Snider will be selling aluminum siding

Snyder is still in SF  Acker is gone

Neither Charlie Kerfeld nor Vance Lovelace presently in Tiger AA but
formerly big leaguers will be playing professional ball

They aren't in the majors

Nor will Dave Rozema who says he's keeping in shape with a hope for
another shot with expansion

Never heard of him

Shawn Hare and Jody Hurst will be in the major leagues
They are outfielders in the Tiger minor league system

I don't think they are in the majors

Ron Hassey will be a minor league manager with the Yankees

Dunno what happened to him

It will be byebye for Balboni

If he's still around he's stuck in the minors

Bo Jackson will not be a starter

Hm  With Raines out Bo looks to get a lot of PT

Gary Huckaby will have moved to Alaska permanently they're on the
net 



and Dave Kirsch will return to Canada to live

Hm

Every single piece of evidence we can find points to Major League Baseball
being  offense  defense  A run scored is just as important as a run
prevented  

Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented
Just as a penny saved is a penny earned  Enough with the cliches

It's not a cliche and unlike your comments below it's not a tautology
It needn't have been true  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially
the same in quality ie if the variance of pitching ability were much
smaller than the variance of batting ability then scoring runs would be
much more important than preventing them simply because the ability to
actively prevent runs would be much weaker

My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to
their potential they won't need much offensive support

If that's your point you should have said so  What you in fact said was
Pitching and defense win championships and later Pitching is the essence
of baseball  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was your 
point and neither of which is true

It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound the other teams score less runs  The team that scores the most 
runs wins  

And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches

This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves  

It's not clear to me at all that this is true  In highscoring games the
team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time  In low
scoring games the split is essentially  regardless of team ability

They should have many 
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting
On the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players
I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers

I thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is
the essence of baseball

Substituting irony for brains Bruce Klopfenstein said

dtatepittedu David M Tate writes

 Of course they left RBIs off we're comparing Alomar the individual with
 Baerga the individual so only individual stats count  

I forgot  Most runs are scored by players stealing home so RBI don't
count for anything

Uh right  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI barring a HR with
nobody on base  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good  I use the phrase happened to be advisedly
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to turn it up a notch in clutchRBIwhatever situations and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an
ability to any measurable extent  There are no clutch hitters  People who
tend to do things that would cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position  

My mistake

I agree

Deletions

Spanky isn't very good defensively anymore he's an offensive liability and
judging from his outburst this winter after the Bucs failed to sign Drabek
he's a jerk with his head in the sand Tommy Prince on the other hand can't
hit In the paper Simmons was citing the case of Tom Pagnozzi who never hit
in the minors or majors but suddenly somehow learned how 

Geez Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime  Comparing
Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable  Prince has never hit well in
the minors and he's now  years old I think  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors  I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have
another brain cramp and forget  He had a very good year at Louisville 
before coming up to the majors  As I recall the hype on Pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit decent fielding  When he got to the 
majors and didn't hit as well as expected not as much playing time he 
became Exhibit  in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation 
as an outstanding defensive catcher  It's not clear he ever learned to
hit  His four years with more than  AB

Born  July 
Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA  
                
                
                
                 

No power lessthanleagueaverage walks peak year when he turned  
now declining  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince
given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors it's not
a rosy picture

BTW I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile who had the same reputation 
coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi except that he was
a much much better hitter to rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a wellabove average hitter
as an average or below average fielding catcher

Keeping in line with the pessimists on the net I'll hold off on the Astros
being all the way back  They could indeed contend but that would count on
   Atlanta encountering some unforeseen problems such as injuries or keeping
     up their early season abysmal hitting

  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation I feel that their
relief staff may be suspect  They don't have a real closer  although
Mike Stanton  saves has been used in that role  Didn't Stanton start off
great last year and then falter  Despite this your point is well taken
Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team thus is 
unlikely to selfdestruct  For Houston to take 'em Atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries particularly to their starting rotation


   Astros relief corps holding together  If Doug Jones keeps his changeup
     effective and Xavier Hernandez can be effective then it's passable
     There's no reasonable lefthanded help and the middle relief is iffy
     Tom Edens was expected to take over the Joe Boever setup man role but
     he's been injured and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway  
     Houston thought that Boever would demand too much money so they let him
     go  Doug Jones can lose his touch  he went from Cleveland's allstar
     closer to the minors in a pretty short span

  From what I understand Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
club  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West 

lousey spring
     closer to the minors in a pretty short span


      Right  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling
      bullpen


     bit of shakiness at the fifth starter slot but that's basically normal
   Taubensee Anthony Gonzalez and Cedeno fulfilling some hitting potential
     Anthony appears to be about there Taubensee's swing looks a lot better
     this year solid knock against Expos last night Gonzalez is showing 
     some early power and Cedeno still has the loopiest swing this side of
     Tim Wallach

      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting
      on base  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finley's job  Biggio concerns me since he usually
      starts the season very strong


                                     

     On a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year's uniform  There is talk that their road uniform will be
blech traditional grey with the word HOUSTON written across the
chest  If I'm not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange shiver  McLane's favorite color is red so
     I'm really upset the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible  I'd like to see the uniform of the mids return  They
may not have been pretty but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball  and I liked it

end of the bargain remember two years ago a little relief goes a long way
then they COULD win  games  But I doubt it  I'll project them at  wins

Eddie

Murray and Jeff Reardon

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving

Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards
marginal

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there They're both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal

     Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors
so

liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if
something

isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When

certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential

candidates the absurdity is apparent Gee can these guys even compare to

the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

Moe Berg my hero  We were just talking about him on Monday at the

I think the title is Moe Berg Athlete Scholar Spy by Tom Sewell
and two other people whose names I forget  Sewell wrote the chapter
on Berg in Danny Peary's book Cult Baseball Players this is a good
source for some of the more famous anecdotes about Berg  Also excellent
is the section on him in Bill Gilbert's book They Also Served about
baseball during WWII  I'm told Berg's spy activities are mentioned in
the recent book Heisenberg's War

His sister also wrote a book about Moe that she selfpublished The 
title is something like My Brother Morris Berg It's mainly some of
her memories and page after page of Xerox copies of pictures and letters
that Moe had saved Copies are kinda hard to find but the Smith Baseball
Library has one for those in Minneapolis

We have one here at Berg's alma mater class of   It's kind of 
a sour thing she disapproved of the job that Sewell et al had done

In article hydragatechEDU gtaprismgatechEDU Brian R Landmann writes
Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball

	He's not the greatest  this is true

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game

	I saw it

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers

	Lankford was hurt although the announcer said he told Torre he
	could pinch hit if they needed him to

Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  What the Hell
is he thinking

	I wondered the same thing  But giving Joe the benefit of the 
	doubt I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that
	he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
	speed on the bases so pinch run him  Alicea I was completely
	confused about  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that
	particular pitcher  I don't know  Anybody got an idea

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench  Gilkey hit over  last year
what does he have to do to start The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league

	Well so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing
	but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play 
	Jordan ahead of him  That I don't quite understand

Furthermore in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate 
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home 

	Yup I looked for this on the replay too  If I'm Joe Torre I'm
	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one  He's
	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe  a hot hitter  
	coming up  there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign 
	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands  
	It's his job to watch the play develop  he should have known Larkin 
	was there to back up a bad throw  That seemed inexcusable in my book  
	BTW I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third 
	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation  On the 
	replay there's Dent waving him around  It looks like this might be a 
	serious problem  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year 
	and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching


I can't take this anymore

	Well I'm still hanging in there

	GO REDBIRDS  WOOF WOOF

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there They're both

Are you for real  How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have  If a

be a given for the Hall  Is defense not just as important  And if
Robin Yount couldn't hit why would he have stuck around long enough
to get  hits  Are you saying  hits is a fluke  
hits is no big deal

I agree Garvey and Morris don't deserve it 

the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

Well based on your argument Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve the Hall of
Fame  He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time
and could throw hard  Very few  game winning seasons lots of
losing seasons lots of walks  No Cy Young awards  How does Nolan
Ryan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated  or  Major
League seasons won  divisons  World Series and won half of his
teams games in   He doesn't compare  Not even close

Kirby Puckett hasn't done it long enough for me  Give me  more
seasons like he's been having then I'll think about it

Does any one out there listen to WFAN  For those of you who do
not know what I am talking about it is an all sports radio
staion in New York  On a clear night the signal reaches up and
down the East coast  In particular I want to know how Len
Berman and Mike Lupica's show is  I go to school in Virginia
so I can't listen when there are on during the day  Just
wondering

The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station but doesn't come close to
the ULTIMATE in Sports Radio  WIP in Philadelphia  The signal
might not be as powerful but then again only stations in New York
feel obligated to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of
hoodlum Mets fans complaining  hours a day  WIP took two of your
best sports jockeys too Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks  
WIP is rockin with sports talk from  AM till midnight check it
out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia  If I'm not
mistaken WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation

Rob

ps the only nice thing about the FAN is that they talk sports all
night  hopefully  will begin to do that somewhat soon

	What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount  Both have hung
around for years and continue to post great stats  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman
get into the Hall  Or Murray Evens Reardon and others  What the hell do

The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard  People are constantly
calling WFAN and WABC with stuff like I was thinking why don't the Yankees
trade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson
that would really help the team  or Do you think the Yankees can get Roger

 Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball
 
 For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game
 
 With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed
 hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers
  
    That's because Lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games
before that
    and was daytoday only available as a pinchrunner 

 
 Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
 lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
 Alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  What the Hell
 is he thinking

     See above
 
 Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
 how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
 regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt But torre said
 he liked Gilkey coming off the bench  Gilkey hit over  last year
 what does he have to do to start The guy would be starting on most every
 team in the league
 
    At the beginning of the interview Torre also said Lankford is the
one outfield
    guy who's in there no matter what
    My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low
    on base percentage  Whiten was a great acquisition decent offense
    and great defense in rightfield  But don't worry Gilkey will be
starting        
    as soon as Jordan or Whiten displays an extended period of low offensive
    output

Actually for the Padres this year so far it's   They are th in

Pythagorean projection puts them at  winning percentage

Good news though is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs

	  gotten more for him than O'Neill Well so far O'Neill is
	  turning out just fine He looks like he should be able to
	  duplicate if not surpass Mel Hall's numbers from last year
	  and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around Tartabull
	  Now if only Buck would play him against lefties some more to 
	  see what he can do

	Wickman A friend made a comparison between Wickman and Jack
	  Morris  they never have impressive stats but they always
	  find some way to win although Morris seems to be losing that
	  ability I figured that Wickman would be the least important
	  part of the Steve Sax trade best trade since we got that Ruth
	  guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever But I like what
	  I've seen so far He doesn't pitch pretty but he gets the job done

	Key What's going on here Key was just supposed to provide
	  the rotation with some stability you know shore up the left
	  side provide experience get maybe  wins and here this guy
	  is dominating everybody he faces Who needs Maddux or Cone 
	  I'll take Key any day

And now the not so pleasant surprises

	Spike Owen Sure he's hitting like crazy but the guy cannot
	  field to save his life And they said he was brought in to
	  provide defense Velarde Stankiewicz and even Silvestri
	  are better defensively than Owen

        Remember  it's still early Look for his offense to tail off and his
defense to improve hopefully He has that rep because I heard that either
last year or over the last  years or something like that  he has the third
highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops  behind CR and
Tony I'm not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all Fernandez I do agree
though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far

	Tartabull The book on Tartabull was keep him healthy and
	  he'll produce Well he hasn't done too much so far Sure he's
	  hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasn't
	  gotten any of the big RBIs that your cleanup man is supposed
	  to give you Then again he had a slow start last year once he
	  got off the DL that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew
	  late in the year so we'll see

	The Bullpen UGHWhat happened We were supposed to have
	  one of the most solid pens in the majors Meanwhile the pen
	  has already blown three saves maybe more  I haven't checked
	  The great HoweFarr leftyrighty tandem Farr's ERA is in the
	  s or s and Howe's isinfinite I didn't think such
	  a thing was possible but it is Hopefully they'll get their
	  acts together or else Buck's gonna burn out the starters
	  for fear that the bullpen'll blow a lead

In the immortal words of the Scooter Holy Cow Seaver That Johnny Key
guy can pitch can't he

See you in the Series

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball
brian a very distressed cardinal fan

 
NoHal McRae is the worst manager in baseball  I've never seen a guy who
can waste talent like he can  One of the best rawtalent staffs in the league
and he's still finding a way to lose  I'll be surprised if he makes it through
the next  weeks unless drastic improvement is made

Are you for real  How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have  If a
guy hung around and hit  homers a year for  years wouldn't he
be a given for the Hall  Is defense not just as important

Frankly no  Offense and defense are equally important  But the
pitcher is  of the defense  The primary role of every other player
is on offense  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive
game than of the defensive game  They might not do much with their
part of the offense but that's another issue

That being said I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF  They
hit pretty well in addition to their defense

Just wondering  A friend and I were talking the other day and
we were for some reason trying to come up with names of Jewish
baseball players past and present  We weren't able to come up
with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
humor us  Thanks for your help

Hank Greenberg would have to be the most famous because his Jewish
faith actually affected his play missing late season or was it world
series games because of Yom Kippur

The other Jewish HOF'er is Rod Carew who converted  

Lowenstein is Jewish as well as Montana's only representative to the
major leagues

Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish  Between Stone
Koufax Ken Holtzman  might have the wrong pitcher I'm thinking of the
one who threw a nohitter in both the AL and NL and Big Ed Reulbach
that's quite a starting rotation  Moe Berg can catch  Harry Steinfeldt
the b in the TinkersEversChance infield

Is Stanky Jewish  Or is that just a Dave Cohen kinda misinterpretation
Whatever doesn't look like he stuck around the majors too long

Why are the Red Sox in first place  Eight games into the season they
already have two wins each from Clemens and Viola  Clemens starts
again tonight on three days rest
 
What's up  Are the Sox going with a fourman rotation  Is this why
Hesketh was used in relief last night

Clemens is going on his normal four days' rest last pitched Saturday 
Hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon his first outing
since an aborted  inning start  days before so he should be plenty
rested to go in his expected turn this Saturday as the th starter  Not
that this is a good thing of course  I'd like to see a wellmanaged
fourman rotation with this team

The only other Jewish ballplayer I can think of is Ron Blomberg who is

 This certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any
 statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what
 percent is fielding 
 
 Not yet I wish there were  It's much more difficult to tease these apart
 than to tease apart scoring runs and preventing runs  

And thus we come to one of the true beauties of baseball these things along
with many others will never be separated Almost everything in baseball is
situational and interdependent This is what allows us to carry on all the
arguments that we have If everything could be explained and balanced on a
statistical basis none of the wonder and mystery would be left Why we might
have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself

 Yesterday April th a friend and I were discussing the theory put
 forth by a local sports radio station personality that the
 Commissionerless baseball owners had snuck a live ball into this years
 baseball games in an effort to increase home run numbers and attract
 fans 

It's always possible but if this is the case I think that there is some
blatant discrimination going on here Clearly Selig is allowing the opposition
to use pre baseballs against the Dodgers
   
 Well guess who stepped up to the plate for his first career grand slam
 last night against the Jays  None other than my boy  It was truly a
 sight to behold

And almost more impressive was that he also got an intentional walk

   Well officially it's the Braves At least up until they started winning
   it was Are they still officially 
   If so why and how did they receive this label

my understanding was that ted turner owner of the braves started running
his tv station nationwide and started running all of his team's games on
his nationwide tv station he dubbed his team ''america's team''  that is
the only team at least at the time all of whose games could be seen
across america

now wor is nationwide out of beautiful secaucus but not all mets games
are on wor  wgn chicago and wsbk boston are two other superstations

There is a book that you can find in sale catalogues occasionally
called Jewish Baseball Stars and baseball mavin Peter Bjarkman has
compiled a pretty definitive list of Jewish ballplayers in the bigs  

I wish I hadn't sold my copy of Jewish Baseball Stars  It's a Short Shelf
ie the one on top of the toilet tank Special  The writing in that 
books is so astonishingly awful  every sportswriting cliche taken to
the nth degree and then mangled  that it's funny

Rusinow is the author I think

I hate to be the burden of bad news but I think I will this time  

The Phillies usually play at either  PM or  PM Eastern Time for
weekdays  On Sundays the time is usually  PM Eastern Time

Boise is in Idaho  Idaho is in part of the Mountain Time Zone and in part
of the Pacific Time Zone  The times that were given were for Mountain Time
Zone starts

Please check a map in case I am wrong  But I am certain that Boise is in the
Mountain Time Zone

to spew their obscenities in front of a group of adults

I try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools
they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use
computers but I'm telling you it's gotten to the point that I don't even edit
the files anymore just read them and throw out the trash  And thanks to all
you people that think it's wonderful to include a swear word or two in your
signature files that's really nice  I have to read the whole article and
then toss it out because of the sig  Don't get me wrong I know all the words you
do and I've even made up some of my own or I wouldn't be able to edit them out 
but this just doesn't seem to be the place a public forum to spew foul language
sorry

Thanks to all you people that keep in mind there might be some decent young
people interested in baseball and computers reading this newsgroup  They enjoy
your articles

Am I supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down Just wondering
I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET especially
for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games
in their newspapers or late TV newscasts This is helpful to fans in other
countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week Also
many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only
available through BBS's or some pay news services By the way mine is free
of charge and has no copyright restrictions

if you want to send updates and scores set up a private mailing list
and use that

Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the
recsportbaseball newsgroup Other than that everything is done through
private email Currently there are  people on my mailing list that
branches off into other mailing lists available for many others And the list
grows by an average of  people a day

If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to
recsportbaseball on a daily basis please just let me know If the response
is overwhelming against the posts I won't do it anymore

   Well officially it's the Braves At least up until they started winning
   it was Are they still officially 
   If so why and how did they receive this label

Probably because everyone that is everyone who has cable can watch
every Braves game They are the only team that has all of its games
broadcast nationwide And if you don't like your local team or you don't
have a local team the Braves can kind of become your local team because
you can watch them every day

Hi all you Ryno fans and those interested
Todays Chicago Tribune had this written in it today in regards to
Ryne Sandberg

Ryne Sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken
left hand and could be back in the lineup by May  manager Jim
Lefebvre said Friday
Doctors cleared Sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his 
gloved hand
'' I'm not surprised his rehabilitation has been moved up'' said
Lefebvre  '' He's a fast healer and he doesn't like being on the 
disabled list  He's been running since he was hurt March  and
is in the best shape of his life  May  is his target date for
getting back in the lineup

Hold on to your hats Cub fansmore later as information
presents itself

I made a mistake on the posted article been fighting food
poisoning for last  hours

The second paragraph should state the following

Doctors cleared Sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball
on a tee and to catch a ball in his gloved hand

Sorry for the error didn't know it until after posting

   Well my guess is because America loves underdogs Every year no matter
   the Cubs' talent or the predictions they never as close to never as
   possible win anything Over the years as the losing has mounted America
   has fallen in love with these perennial losers The Cubs have more fans
   in Chicago then some teams do worldwide The Cubs have more fans 
   worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined 
   An aura of excitement surrounds the Cubs at the beginning of the season
   like no one else including the WS champs It must be that Eternal Hope

Actually I admired the spirit of the fan at the Cubs opener several years
ago who held up a sign that said Wait Till Next Year

 Of course they have special emphasis on the Yankees and Mets

Beware  The original poster looks to be from Louisville and chances are  
Louisville gets the edition of the NYTimes that is printed in Chicago for the

Why  Do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time  He's   
In a few years he'll be   He doesn't get to as many grounders as
he used to and will get to fewer still as his legs go as they do

 In the new book about the Mets it talks about how they like to rape little
 girls before games  Sick jerks
                                     Max


	Is this the book by Bob Klapisch spelling The
Worst Team Money Can Buy  If it is I wouldn't give the book
or anything in it any value whatsoever  Klapisch wrote the
book to make money obviously and sensational literature is
going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the
papers  I'm not calling him a liar but if there was any proof
that a Met player had raped a little girl before a game let
alone doing it on a regular basis they would be in jail not
Shea
	For those people who do not know what the press is like
in New York it is probably more cutthroat than in just about
any other part of the US  Keith Hernandez said it very well on
ESPN a couple of days ago they would much rather mention a
clubhouse fight than a tworun homer in the ninth to win a
game  I do not read Klapisch's news columns regularly but I
do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator
that enjoys hopefully for only professional reasons to drumb
up a news story even if there isn't one there  Now as far as
the confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago I almost
totally blame Bonilla  No matter what a member of the press
does and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might
be that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a
journalist  
	Personally I always thought that a beat writer that
always follows a club around should report the news but not be
looking to degrade a team  I don't know whether to blame
Klapisch because that may be the only way to keep a job in New
York

One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the
split probably somewhere around  and 

 I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe  or
 even  Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
 identical batting stats which wouldn't be that unreasonable and
 even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base they'll score a lot
 more than the Oleruds by going firsttothird more often No offense
 Gordon

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value

The above effect is clear but there are other effects as well  If
Olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold
at third  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's  Of course Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams  No
team in the 's ran much but some teams certainly had faster players
than others  Still the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 's for all teams  

Bill James gives the  Senators as an example  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in  stole  bases with
 times caught stealing  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created

Mr Hernandez 
  
   I apologize for the misunderstanding  I explained that I know that it
is essential for some fans to get scores here for they cannot get them
elsewhere  I have no problem with what you do posting scores AFTER the
games have been completed  However like I said earlier I don't think it
is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games like some others
have come to practice

I've recently been working on project to determine the greatest
players at their respective postions  My sources are Total Baseball
James' Historical Abstract The Ballplayers biography word of

Feel free to comment suggest flame whateverbut I tried

How can Brooks be    I think he would at least be ahead of Ron Santo

Because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up for the large difference in hitting  Their average
seasons using their combined average  AB  BB per  games

         Years  AB  H  R  B B HR RBI TB  BB  AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS
Santo

         Years   P    A   DP   E   PCT
Santo              
Robinson           

Even if Robinson's extra  putouts  assists and  DPs are taken to mean
he was responsible for  more outs in the field that doesn't make up
for the extra  outs he made at the plate not to mention the fewer
total bases  The difference of  in OPS should be decreased by about
 to account for Wrigley but a  difference is still considerable
The Thorn  Palmer ratings are

           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total

Robinson                                        
Usual disclaimers about TP's FR apply but they really shouldn't be
way off the mark in this comparison  At least it's better than fielding
percentage Carney Lansford has a   th best alltime but  FR
dead last of all time  Also since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level Robinson should be
awarded an extra  or so for playing  more games  He had a great
career but I would prefer Santo's plus  years of a replacement level Bman

But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack
That's a similar story Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's
superior fielding  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better
choices IMHO of course though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view

CF
  Andre Dawson

Shouldn't that be right field

I meant to comment on this at the time

There's just no way baserunning could be that important  if it was
runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is  

Runs Created is usually about  accurate on a team level and
there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
remaining percent

Disclaimer  This is for fun

In my computerized baseball game I keep track of a category called
stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not
make with average effort  Using the  Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols Thanks Sherri I've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen Hits Stolen have been redefined as Plays Kurt
Stillwell would not have made

OK I realize that's unfair  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff
fluke shots and a monster park factor  But let's put it this way  If we
replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's  out
making ability how many extra hits would go by

To try and correlate it to reality a little more I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make  By the same method I've calculated Net Double
Plays and Net Extra Bases doubles and triples let by

Finally I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution or
DCON   Basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS Defense  Onbase Plus Slug which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team  So don't
take it too seriously  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article

The short version  definition of terms
HS  Hits Stolen  Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS  Net Hits Stolen  Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP  Net Double Plays  Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB  Net Extra Bases   Extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder
DCON  Defensive Contribution  bases and hits prevented as a rate

More discussion 

DCON formula  NHS  NDPPA  NHS  NDP  NEBAB
Why such a bizzare formula  Basically it's designed to be added into the
OPS with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored
The extra outs are factored into OBP while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors

Davis and Strawberry attributed their turn arounds to Reggie Smith
the Dodger batting coach who flew in from Florida three days
ago and gave them a pep talk and some instruction  Davis was
 yesterday and had a couple more hits today  Strawberry
had two hits yesterday and I believe he had two more today with
two home runs


Foolish me  And here I thought it had something to do with the 
fact that they were hitting against Wakefield who had no kncukle
to his ball that day and Otto who has no stuff  I wonder if 
Reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the

   Well officially it's the Braves At least up until they started winning
   it was Are they still officially 
   If so why and how did they receive this label
   
   Unoffically but without a doubt America's Team is the Cubs Why
   Well my guess is because America loves underdogs Every year no matter
   the Cubs' talent or the predictions they never as close to never as
   possible win anything Over the years as the losing has mounted America
   has fallen in love with these perennial losers The Cubs have more fans
   in Chicago then some teams do worldwide The Cubs have more fans 
   worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined 
   An aura of excitement surrounds the Cubs at the beginning of the season
   like no one else including the WS champs It must be that Eternal Hope
   this is the year they've got the talent they're off to a good start
    they've got the pitching or hitting or whatever their strong point is
    at the time It's that inevitability that the Cubs WILL eventually 
    win the WS again When Only God knows Since it's been so long it 
   could come at any time or it could be another  years But until they
   do finally win and start winning consistently The Cubs will remain
   America's Lovable Underdogs The Cubs areAMERICA'S TEAM
   Orin
   Bradley U

	The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
out of nowhere to contend  The ' Mets and ' Orioles are prime examples
not the Cubs  I root for the Cubs because I feel sorry for them but 
basically they are dogs  The Pirates today are a great example of an underdog
If the Rockies and Marlins compete they will be underdogs  The North Stars
trip to the Stanley Cup finals was a good example of an underdog's journey 
The Cubs have a good team this year and play in a weak division they are much
less than America's Team

White Sox   It is Red Sox th win of this season

So far Red Sox won all the games Roger and Frank V pitched  and 
when other three starters were pitching  Tomorrow Dopson will pitch again
have a good first start and rocky second start  I wonder that Bosox can
play over  ball without Roger and Frank V

OK the Mets and O's are good examples but what about the ' Reds  Do you
really think that anyone expected them to sweep the A's  I know people who
didn't even think they'd win a game let alone win the Series  We proved 
them wrong though didn't we

As for this year ignore their record now  They've had a rocky start and
that has nothing to do with Colorado  They shall rise again  The hunt for
a Reds' October continues with all due respect to WLW  Bye

Once again the Rockies bullpen fell apart  Andy Ashby pitched six somewhat
shaky innings giving up just one run  Then game the dreaded relief  Three
picthers combined to give up  runs one each I believe in the th inning
and blew the save opportunity  Final was  vs Expos

Despite their problems in the pen I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly  Going into today's game the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man Galarraga two of the leaders in stolen bases Young
and Cole and increasingly strong starting pitching

With the HAWK the Red Sox definitely have a chance for the

Jack Morris' starts have been like his playoff starts  He has an ERA of
 in his  starts

What does luck have to do with a  ERA  He was lucky to get  wins
last year but he had an ERA of  with a team that scored a lot of
runs  I would be happy if he could still pitch with an ERA of  but
he seems to be suffering from a total callapse  

Bad pitchers are more prone to this total collapse than good pitchers
They are closer to the chasm of mediocrity  The smallest push and
they completely lose their grip

     But good ones can collapse somewhat then come back the next year
Burleigh Grimes went from  wins and an ERA of  or so in ' to  and
an ERA around  in '  He pitched well for several more years  Carlton
won  and lost  the year after his  record Source Bill James
Historical Baseball Abstract
     And let's not forget John Tudor who started  and finished  in
  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at
the start of the season

He gave up early runs
in his ' games and would get stronger as the game went on thus giving
up few runs in the last going  He stays in the game and gets the win
How else would he have pitched so many innings

Yup  He used to dig himself a hole then get it together and stick in
until the run support eventually came through  This year he just
hasn't gotten it together

     If I recall he had a  ERA in the st half and a  ERA in the
nd half of last year  
     Hmmm  runs in  innings  Suppose he starts  more games and winds
up w innings pitched  If he allows  runs a game in the next 
innings he'll have a  ERA or so at the end of the year I think I have
his totals right This is going to be hard to come back from

Jack may be finished  It is time to retire or be released if he does
not return to his form from last year

His  million contract is an awful lot to eat

     My st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy and that he may be pitching
through an injury and not telling anyone  My nd guess is that he will be
banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts
Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL  Or will Danny Cox who went  or 
scoreless innings against the Tribe today start for Morris  He looks like
a really good one  Gaston is scrambling to find starters I'd imagine
Luckily the Jays have a very good offense
     I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year
He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox

Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated 
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a  comefrombehind victory over 
New York Hernandez ran for pinchhitter Cecil Espy who got the inning started 
with a solid single to right moved to second on Bob Kelly's infield sneaker
down the thirdbase line and to third on Jeff Branson's wellplaced bunta 
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense

Cincinnati trailed  after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth  He had only 
given up one hit in the first four innings a fourthinning leadoff double
by Vince Coleman  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short  Orselak was pinchhitting for Eddie Murray who 
argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by drawing the line really he
should know better than that  Murray and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed

The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's firstpitch homer  Pugh must 
have been slightly shaken as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's
single then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was surprise misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawnin Branson
failed to bring Thompson in then the play of the game occured

Saberhagen was due up so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze  They called it perfectly
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's firstpitch pitch out and the threat ended
Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great

The Reds picked up  runs in the seventh to knot up the game  After Barry Larkin's
ground out Mitchell Chris Sabo and Randy Milligan got backtobacktoback
singlesthe third scoring Mitchell  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too lateWilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally

Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonilla's threerun dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season  Bonilla ended
up walking and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a 
week and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities  The win went
to Steve Foster  who got in what must be an egoboosting two perfect innings
work striking out three  Saberhagen  got the lossthough I'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth  I'll take it though

The Reds are now  still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today  The Mets are

In a previous article swedacssitdumichedu Sean Sweda says


I've been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the
net for a while I figured I'd stick my neck out a bit

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL
team since the inception of the DH rule  ps any ideas what this is

They will fall easily short of  runs that's for damn sure  I can't
believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our
Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of
genius for the tradesaquisitions he's made

     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in ' or '  True
Cone is probably as good as Drysdale and they have no Koufax but still
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with
lots of lowscoring games etc  And they didn't use relievers whereas
Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them
     That being said I still picked them th or so but I think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting  There's more of a
chance of that I think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching  At least to me
     I wonder though  which one do you people think would do better  a team
with Johnson Koufax in his prime Seaver Carlton and Young in no real
order as the starters with Sutter Fingers and Lyle in the bullpen but
with a puny offense assuming good defense like Mazeroski Maranville etc
Or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of Cobb Carew Ruth Gehrig
Mays Schmidt Wagner and Bench  againyou pick the order
     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end  Even the best hitters can succeed only  of the time in
their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts  taking all
the players in their prime they might throw  shutouts in a year  And all
the offense would have to do is get  run across
     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all
time teams into a regular season have it played and report the results
I would love to see that

	To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the 
Cards and the Yanks  He hit three  times  I am almost sure about this In
case anyone is wondering the record for two homer games is held by Babe
Ruth and is   Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan
Gonzalez  He has at least three games with three and maybe   I know that 
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie  I don't have any record
books at college for me to check on though  Please let me know okay if I 
am wrong  
	Onto the Padres  Is there anyone out there who follows them especially those with access to local news  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I
can't get McPaper consistently around here  
comment  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann  Of course Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of  but with a lower average  Bell always could finish
with  and  hrsessentially Jerald Clark's numbers  
leadoff comment  Craig Shipley  I get on base  of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff  Hell of the usual starters use Gwynn  He's got  steals
already  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell though  I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores  Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn  He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases
Sheffield comment  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing
Witness Phillips batting  currently  But does Sheffield have an injury
or anythingelse wrong with him  I just don't hear anything
Andy Benes  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '   or is 
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then   Has anyone 
seen him pitch the two good games
score for today Sunday april   Padres  St Louis   Padres sweep the
Cardinals as Gwynn goes  for  with a homer  Sheffield and Tueful also homer
in a winning cause

   Sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent

Well with players certainly  However it is quite possible to win
it all with no managerial talent  Cf Blue Jays

Currently he's all over  He played nd when Deshields was out  He was
shifted to third when Delino came back  And today he played SS for a cold
Wil Cordero  

His natural positions seem to be in the middle infield but they will seemingly
find a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot

nice woofing or should i say meowing
and yes the Tiggers are a fun exciting team that i would pay to see
but last year they went  this year their offense is essentially
the same and their pitching is at best essentially the same so why
do you think they will suddenly improve to win the  or so games which will
be required to win the AL East what has changed that i don't see

remember a  win is worth as much in the standings as a  win

I would amend your definition to

           talent

Dave


OK the Mets and O's are good examples but what about the ' Reds  Do you
really think that anyone expected them to sweep the A's  I know people who
didn't even think they'd win a game let alone win the Series 

These people were very silly  Any team that gets to the World Series
can win the World Series and anybody who ever expects a sweep is
crazy  If you put the best team in baseball in the Series against
the worst team in baseball the worst team would win at least a game
most of the time and very well could win the Series though the odds
would certainly be against them

So far Simmons looks like a total idiot


 Zane Smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the DL I
would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all

 I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's
reputation Now he looks like he is back in his ' form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters Four our sakenot Ted's sake I hope he
pitches with a  ERA for the rest of the season Yeah right

 Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing They are still doing decently
BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters
Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year He showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year

 Walk Well he seems to be on the losing end tonight BUt I still think that
Walk desrved his contract

 Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation I
can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers Even if they do what's the use He is aright hander like Slaught
Not a very smart platoon Also I am blaming Leyland in this case since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffsSLaught
should have played in all  games he has a good average against right handed
pitching Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year

 Dennis MOeller is SCARY
 Candeleria Well he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the
season Maybe it will be in  range BUt  million  plus Come on Other
than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks
Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year So far he seems to have
pitched well for the Rangers I think the PIrates should have spent the money
on Patterson in stead

 The Rookie batters Well Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact Other than that their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise I think we should thank Doughty for that

 Rookie Pitchers Worse than expected especially Cooke
 Slaught How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year NOw his
value has increased immensely

 Lonnie Smith Well Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount
Let's see Eric can hit better He can run better He can field better
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this yearhe won't be an asset He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field

 Management BIG BIG ZERO Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay
 Alex Cole fiasco The PIrates infield and CF positions look good The
RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace
two of the four outfielders Eric Davis Van Slyke and Cole would have made a
very respectable outfield Even without Eric Davis thye PIrates would have
a respectable outfield with Cole SVan Slyke and MercedI think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting Simmons did have options
for the outfield Ironically the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap Too bad

 Compensatory draft picks for Bonds Forget it The pirates can rant and rave
they will not get those picks As of now the issue is still being appealed
Now if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots
nothing else will

On a final note Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 
starts BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season Also if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speedhe has peaked
in the second half of the last  seasons

 totally blame Bonilla  No matter what a member of the press

oooooo cheap shot 

 Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his

who cares he had two of them before he came to Toronto and if the
Jays had signed Viola instead of Morris it would have been Frank who
won  and got the ring and he would be on his way to  this year too

 Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best 
 signing

your logic is curious and spurious

there is no reason to believe that Viola wouldn't have won as many games
had he signed with Toronto when you compare their stupid WL records
be sure to compare their team's offensive averages too


now looking at anything like the MorrisViola sweepstakes a year later
is basically hindsight but there were plenty of reasons why it
should have been apparent that Viola was the better pitcher based
on previous recent years and also based on age Frank is almost 
years younger how many knew that people got caught up in the '
World Series and then on Morris'  wins last year wins are the stupidest
most misleading statistic in baseball far worse than RBI or R that he
won  just means that the Jays got him a lot of runs

the only really valid retort to Valentine is weren't the Red Sox trying
to get Morris too oh sure they said Viola was their first choice
afterwards but what should we have expected they would say

 And don't tell me Boston will win this year  They won't 
 even be in the top  in the division more like th

if this is true it won't be for lack of contribution by Viola so who cares

	There are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is
either in the Jays' farm system or the Braves' His name is Bill Taylor
He was picked up by the Jays but had to be offered back to the Braves
before they were able to send him to the Syracuse Chiefs

	One report says that the Braves took him back and assigned him
to Richmond The other says that he is on the Chiefs' roster Which one is
right

Not a very smart platoon Also I am blaming Leyland in this case since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffsSLaught
should have played in all  games he has a good average against right handed
pitching Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year

Sorry but this is the biggest load of bunk I've seen in a while 
a The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now
Nobody was even vaguely interested
b Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince
who was out of options
c LaValliere's release had nothing to do with him being through He
was released because in the event of an injury to Slaught
LaValliere is no longer capable they believe of being the everyday
catcher

Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties
the offense should actually improve with this move

HEY All you Yankee fans who've been knocking my prediction of Baltimore
You flooded my mailbox with cries of Militello's good Militello's good

Where is he I noticed he got skipped over after that oh so strong first
outing

About as good as Mussina's better than Sutcliffe's and McDonald's

  He's not by any chance in Columbus  now is he 
He's in the bullpen Steinbrenner is in charge after all

 Please don't tell
me you're relying on this guy to be the fourth not the fifth but the 
fourth starter on this brittle pitching staff  

He's got the talent to be the th starter now and evetually the ace
He was a higher ranked and generally better prospect than Arthur
Rhodes who happens to be well hey the Oriole's th starter


As for the O's it's still early

As for Militello it's still early

Ted you're missing a vital point  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices  Bonilla
on the other hand was found to have mentioned this one word a single time
 If he had been known to go around criticizing homosexuals it would be a
different story  Furthermore he is merely an athlete  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do  Dave Pallone the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea  He like you thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension  In my opinion
that's downright ludicrous  As Howie Rose on WFAN said if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a threeonthree game  Now honestly if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts

if this is true note that i don't think it is lasorda should be

The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs
by beating them  in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday
afternoon  It was the Phils only win in the three game series and
was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young
season   The Phils jumped to a  lead in the game thanks to 
John Kruk run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers  However Danny
Jackson and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead
Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 
however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it  In
the th Dave Hollins hit a threerun shot his first of the year
to push the Phils ahead to stay  However in a shaky bottom of the
th the Cubs scored  runs and had the tying runner on base when
the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan they were out of
position players and Myers bunted into a double play to end the
game

The Phils bring their league leading  record back to action
Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday against the Padres

 In any case I think Viola would have made a better signing  Why
 Viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does
 Toronto have

Well I agree that Viola is a better signing  However why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect eg Yankee Stadium
Most batters in MLB are righthanded so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's  However this is probably
only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season

I think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage

Am I missing something here

the only really valid retort to Valentine is weren't the Red Sox trying

afterwards but what should we have expected they would say

Lou wanted Morris all along  The idiot  Giving the man  million
to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the
safety off  The only question is how many shots he will get off
before somebody is wise enough to take it away

 And don't tell me Boston will win this year  They won't 
 even be in the top  in the division more like th

if this is true it won't be for lack of contribution by Viola so who cares

I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth  The bottom four
teams last year were essentially tied  Boston in seventh place had
 wins  The Yankees and Indians tied for fourth place had  wins

Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than
the Indians or Tigers  Basically the Red Sox are stronger this year
at B DH SS LF and RF  They have healthier starting pitchers so
far at least and better relievers  I see no reason why they
shouldn't win  games  Meanwhile the Indians are in shambles and
the Tigers still have no pitching  They will win some 
blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of  games too

MAYBE the Sox will play poorly win  games and finish fifth
But I think third or fourth place is more likely

Why did I get sucked into this

In article Aprnewsyaleedu Austin Jacobs writes
Don't you GUYS think so  I mean c'mon  What the heck are women doing
even THINKING of getting into baseball  They cause so many problems  Just

Assuming you're serious I guess you'd be surprised to hear
that us GUYS don't think so I would guess that a tiny fraction
of  of the folks reading your post agree with it I kind of
doubt that even you agree with it

I'm not going to go through your points one at a time because 
after all not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball

I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema the
AAA umpire who sued is suing baseball on the grounds of sex
discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors

Jeez  Look at Pam Postema  Just because she's a woman everybody on the
face of the earth thinks it's great that she's getting an opportunity to
ump  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of
roast beef you'd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires

I've never seen her ump a game I have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire

But I have seen her on talk shows And her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most It seems
to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees
the role of umpires in the game well I wouldn't promote her
either

The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out hell Joe Lundy could do that Their primary function is
to maintain order in the game keep the game moving and keep the
players from trying to kill each other 

Umpires have to be extremely tough people That disqualifies most
of us both men and women And if Ms Postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook then I think that disqualifies her as well Umpires
need to command the game command of the rulebook is secondary

Summary oh please it's way too early to get upset

Mamatha Devineni Ratnam mrandrewcmuedu writes
So far Simmons looks like a total idiot

Whatever you say  I think it's just  games into the season myself so
I'm going to wait a bit before calling names

 I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week Now Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmons'
reputation Now he looks like he is back in his ' form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters Four our sakenot Ted's sake I hope he
pitches with a  ERA for the rest of the season Yeah right

I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher and I have no
idea why Simmons ever wanted him  On the other hand I expect him to
release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast  BTW
Otto's game score for that  IP stinker was only  which points out
a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad
and excruciatingly prolonged

 Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing They are still doing decently
But considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse 

I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey but aren't you willing to
give him some more at bats and Tomlin a few more starts before acting
so gloomy

 Walk Well he seems to be on the losing end tonight BUt I still think 
that Walk desrved his contract

No he didn't  Walk is a time bomb  He has no stuff whatsoever and when
the league finally realizes this it won't be pretty at all

 The Rookie batters Well Young has surprised me a bit with his
instant impact Other than that their excellent performance hasn't
been too much of a surprise I think we should thank Doughty for that

Don't be so fast  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele which
was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors
Meanwhile I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a
sixyear free agent before the  season

 Rookie Pitchers Worse than expected especially Cooke

Twice through the rotation and you've given up  Yikes

 Slaught How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year 
Now his value has increased immensely

But so has his age at least in baseball terms  The useful halflife
of a  yearold injuryprone catcher can't be much longer than a year

 Lonnie Smith Well Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount

But he wanted to be a Dodger and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous   I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign
him

Let's see Eric can hit better He can run better He can field better
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith 

He certainly wasn't last year

Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this yearhe won't be an asset 
He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field

Hey that's the Skates Smith package deal  Anybody who acquires
Lonnie for his defense or baserunning particularly at this stage is
a real weirdo

 Management BIG BIG ZERO Sauer has yet to make a forceful argument
in favor of revenue sharing He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay

If that's the goal of the team ownership than I don't see why Sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy  I don't know what he has or
hasn't said about revenue sharing so I can't comment there

Ironically the biggest accomplishment of Simmons' tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap Too bad that he gave him away in the
expansion draft

It's annoying but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain Jeff King it was probably unavoidable  Meanwhile I think
bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for
John Smiley not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year drafting well in  letting the rookies show something
in   Foley Smith and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to
the Bucs' future

 Compensatory draft picks for Bonds Forget it The pirates can rant 
and rave they will not get those picks As of now the issue is still 
being appealed

Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case  I
never heard the outcome of this  When will the final verdict be in on
this

Now if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots
nothing else will

I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case so I don't know who to
blame  It might have been Doug Danforth after all  In fact I
seriously suspect it was Doug Danforth who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
pointed at his feet

btwI've wondered whether my latest posts have been getting
offsite so if somebody known to impersonate ee cummings can see
this would he drop me a short note

The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their
quest for more lefthanded pitching  So far no takers
Personally I think Harris is a defensive liability and he
has also led the team in past years for hitting into double
plays or at least been among the leaders
 
Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
every day he can get the job done  If Sharpy played just
one base every day say third he'd also improve defensively
 
Wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has Reed
The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
effect on the pitching staff  Both Astacio AND Martinez
were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays
Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
have seen him lifted in the third in past years
 
Astacio lasted  innings the other day under similar circumstances
The Dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls
in the infield than last year  And Piazza has also been great
on defense  He has thrown out  of  batters trying to
steal and has at least one pick off at first
 
Wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on
defense  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers
some runs  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average
I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw
seem to have come out of theirs

We won't really be able to say anything for at least another couple of
weeks  But so far it looks like a homerific season  Might the umps
be squeezing the strike zone



Watching the Braves on TBS I would have said that the strike zone
in the NL has expanded this season  Specifically it appears that
the strike zone has moved above the belt  Yeah the announcers
have commented on that also but it was also my perception

However the strike zone hasn't climbed all the way up to
the letters  It's more like a little ways under the letters

Any other perceptions out there

Judging by the way the Reds' pitchers have performed thus far it
appears to me that the zone has been squeezed to the size of a grape

	Spike Owen Sure he's hitting like crazy but the guy cannot

	  are better defensively than Owen

Remember  it's still early Look for his offense to tail off and
his defense to improve hopefully He has that rep because I heard
that either last year or over the last  years or something like
that  he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league
shortstops  behind CR and Tony I'm not gonna help this sorry Mets
team at all Fernandez I do agree though that he has not looked all
that impressive in the field thus far

Owen only has one error so far I believe  That seriously
underrepresents the harm he has done in the field

Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches  He will have a fine
fielding percentage like always  The problem is that he doesn't
reach anything that isn't hit straight at him

This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to
Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura  But the third baseman for the Yankees
is Wade Boggs who should have moved across the diamond last year

I've only seen one game Abbott's first start but there were three
balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality
defensive players  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott

or second starter  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound the other teams score less runs  The team that scores the most 
runs wins  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves 

Not clear to me at all  I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
 games than  games  In the  game luck is going to play a much
bigger role than in the  game

Does anyone know where Billy Taylor is  Richmond or Syracuse  He was taken
by the Jays in the Rule V draft but not kept on the roster  Baseball Weekly
said that he was demoted to Syracuse but a Toronto paper indicated that
the Braves took him back  Is there an Atlanta fan or anyone reading this

Dave Winfield's name does not go
 in the same sentence As Aaron Robinson and Ott 



       In terms of PEAK and I repeat PEAK years Winfield has Done it  
all He has batted in the 's for a season drove in  and more runs  
many times in a row before his injury Consistently hit at or near   
while knocking in  home runs Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  
slugging percentage for three or  of his best seasons I still think that  
dave was one of the BETTER of all time but obviously not the best He was  
one of the best athletes evr to play baseball He hit line drives that hit  
the scoreboard in leftcenter field a feat np one has done in the new  
Stadium Heck only  or  other people have hit it over that green fence  
since it has been remodeled He could field had a bullet arm and his  
hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields and barry bonds  
of last season He is older now and slowing down takes more of an  
uppercut to lift the ball out of the park but he will always be my hero  
and my idol There is nothing that could make me happier than George  
inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  
Yankees Of course he will most likely refuse the offer but who knows  
For  million dollars he'll play Heck they are giving gallego   
million this year having Dave as their DH while leaving him time to play  
the field when Tartabull is injured or Nokes and mass are traded should  
give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  
of Yankee domination

Summary Dave Winfield was a marginal ballplayer  Yeah right

NewsSoftware VAXVMS VNEWS     

In article Aprnewsyaleedu  Steve Tomassi writes
     Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it
I mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
as is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell
Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon

	Oh yeah  Dave Winfieldmarginal player  Guy didn't hit a lick had
negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power  Dave Winfield
now entering his I believe th big league season is still a damn decent
hitter  Admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime
he had a powerful arm and great range  Take a look at the stats  I don't 
know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are
similar players  Kingman was a onedimension power hitterhe couldn't field
he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if I remember right his
OBP wasn't THAT hideous and for those who consider such things important
was a absoluteprimodick  
	Eddie Murray  Yup only the best st baseman of the 's  I know that
MVP votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the
MVP he deserved in  it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media  
	Lee Smith  Hmmmm This one's actually pretty close  He's had a s
solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks 
Wrigley Fenway  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats it's been 
a while but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber  
	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers
simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you 
blow a bunch too  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and for a month
Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one 
the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves  No way should 
HomerMan be in the HOF IMHO
	Darrell Evans  Nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like
Ted Simmons IMHO but not a HOF'er

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards
marginal

	Lemme ask you this  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there They're both
shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal
Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors so
liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if something

	Now wait a goddamn minute here  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the
position of shortstop  His defense was SO good that he's won something along
the lines of  Gold Gloves  Again Gold Gloves are mediotbiased and a 
good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more
recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early
's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career  Ozzie's
offense you ask  Good OBP great speed numbers in a park which for most of his
career depressed offense admittedly no power 'cept against Tom Niedenfuer
 but still a definite asset offensively
	Yount   hits MVP at two different positions uhhuh a real
stiff  His ' was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks as far as
SS numbers go  He's a clear HOF'er IMHO

isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When 
certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential 
candidates the absurdity is apparent Gee can these guys even compare to
the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

	Well as far as Garvey goes you're right  Garvey is a mediot 
candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one
at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of
a tree stump  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF
	SkyJack  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last
year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about Morris' ability to win which is nothing more than Morris' ability
to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs  At this point Morris is an
average pitcher although from his early returns in ' he may be damned 
close to done  But in all fairness Morris was a dominant pitcher in the
's for upanddown Tiger teams  While  was obviously a great year
for Detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but
not favorites  Morris' career numbers are quite good and worthy of HOF
consideration  
	Ryan  Of course but be careful  I guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about Yount and Smith being shortstops who 
hung around a long time  After all Nolan never won a Cy  Damn he's 
just pitcher who hung around for  years  His WL record is mediocre
Of course Nolan's a HOF'er
	Puck  Probably although he's got to play reasonably well for a few
more years  years even good ones aren't enough to make the HOF most
likely  That said I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something REALLY 
tragic or sudden  He's very popular in the media and with fans and
legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the
league  I've always liked the guy and I hope he does make it  And in the
end I think the Puck will make it in  But really it's too early to sell

	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it 
or not I never tire of it  It's an interesting subject  Here's an off
the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team  I probably
left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up  I won't consider ANYONE
who started playing after about  again too early to tell Note these
are all active players I'm not counting recent retirees

Baltimore  Cal Ripken should be a lock by now even if Gehrig's record stands
Boston Roger Clemens might be a lock already which is amazing Dawson 
Detroit Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker possibilities
Milwaukee Robin Yount discussed earlier
New York Wade Boggs possibly Mattingly long shot
Toronto Paul Molitor and Jack Morris possibilities

Kansas City George Brett lock
Minnesota Kirby too early to tell Winfield lock
Oakland Eckersley lock McGwire too early Rickey lock Welch LONG shot
Texas The Mighty Nolan Too early to consider Canseco or Strange 

Cubs Sandberg lock
St Louis Ozzie lock Lee Smith probably
New York Murray almost a lock Saberhagen obviously he's got to regain
				  	      past form
And most certainly NOT Vince Coleman despite what he'll tell you 

Los Angeles Butler Strawberry and Hershiser are all long shots
San Diego Tony Gwynn pretty good shot
Colorado Dale Murphy a good shot Ryan Bowen just to see if you're awake

Darryl Strawberry's moon shots were fun  He can hit those high and far
home runs that if he actually ran them out he'd be rounding second base
by the time they landed  We used to say that he should have to file a
flight plan at LaGuardia for some of them  Then BullDurham came out
and that was changed  

On homers he pulled that didn't go high they were microwave home runs
Microwave as in they got outta there in a hurry  In a game in  he
came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket
down the right field line that didn't even allow Bob Murphy the luxury
of a home run call  The story went he stayed in the clubhouse the with
the Mets down by two and two on Davey Johnson sent for him to pinch hit
He came out of the clubhouse saying one swing and we go home  He hit
the homer ran the bases then went straight for the clubhouse to shower
and go home

Those were the days

My question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the
death of baseball so strongly  I have seen articles of a similar vein in 
the Chicago Tribune and in sports editorials on tv

Maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are
responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom 
These allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times losing
money bankruptcies at an alarming rate and there's going to be an
increased degradation of the product they produce  Could you imagine
IBM with all their problems promoting themselves the way Major League
Baseball does  Their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths not
that they are too far from it now   What would happen at GM  Where
would GM be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an
inferior product because of alleged labor problems I think it shows a
lack of confidence for the people who run the game

Anyway it just frustrates me when the media says such things because it
inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing playoffs to
satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest  

Forget it  Word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about
a done deal  It has to be decided soon since negotiations with the
networks also have to begin soon

Boy hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put
down Braves fans  I mean all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive
world series  Also being the Cubs fan that I am I really have to hand it to
all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that
infernal cheer that they have  

However I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid  The
way I see it either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it or that observation
was just plain wrong  You might have us confused with Bear fans 

Anyway about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs
would finish up last in their division  Even behind Florida  Sheesh  
These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective
division  Well  we're ten games into the season and these people are a little
less vocal now  I wonder why

Well the way I see it the East is up for grabs and whoever wants it most is
going to take it with the exception of Florida  Every team seems to have
good batting and pitching with Philly presently leading the pack  But I just
have to point out if the Cubs do take the East they'll do it without the
benefit of a competent manager  However and it pains me to say it the
pennant is going to go to the West

Just had to get that off my chest

Was going over some videos last night

Studying  and  videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting  And enlightening

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco circa Sep ' and Jose Canseco
circa June 

  He's bulked up too much  Period  He needs to LOSE about  pounds
    not gain more bulk

  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED  Conservatively I'd say he's
    lost  of his bat speed and that's a HUGE amount of speed

  That open stance is KILLING him   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is
    released  Downing could do this without significant head movement 
    Canseco can't  Also note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes
    they're fully closed  Without a good starting point it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing

What would I do if I were Jose

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch
so that I'd never have to work again I'd restructure my entire swing

First minimize movement before the swing  Close and widen the stance
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing  Hopefully this
will cut down on the time I need to swing and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely

Second drop  pounds  Cut out the weight work

Third relax the wrists  Will cost some power but until I can find
my  stroke concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up rolling
the wrists through the strike zone and hit line drives  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems he'll be out of baseball in three years  If not he could
still hit  HR

For the second straight game California scored a ton of late runs to crush
the Brewhas It was six runs in the th for a  win Monday and five in
the th and six in the th for a  win yesterday Jamie Navarro pitched
seven strong innings but Orosco Austin Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday How's this for numbers Maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is  The next lowest
on the staff is Wegman at  Ouch

It doesn't look much better for the hitters Hamilton is batting  while
Thon is hitting  and has seven RBI The next highest is three The next
best hitter is Jaha at  and then Vaughn who has the team's only HR at
 Another ouch Looking at the stats it's not hard to see why the team
is  In fact  doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runsgame
and giving up game 

Still it's early and things will undoubtedly get better The offense should
come around but the bullpen is a major worry Fetters Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year Lloyd Maldanado Manzanillo 
Fetters Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place The starters will be okay
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen
is a big question mark

In other news Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday while William
Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal Today's game
with California was cancelled

One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled
'Pitching is  of Baseball' implying that fielding is   How do
they determine that  Beats me  it's been a long long time since I

One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the

Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his th career win as moments ago
the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium
by beating the A's  Here are the highlights


				R    H   E    
             Oakland		       
	     Detroit                   

Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from st with an RBI double in the 
bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the
Tigers the victory  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to
tie the score in the ninth also off Eckersley sp

The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the st and a solo
homer by Reuben Sierra in the th  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the
th for the other Tiger run

John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers once again lasting
through the seventh inning  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas
in the th and Haas got the win  Bobby Witt started for the A's and was
replaced by Honeycutt in the th followed by Goose Gossage in the th and
finally Eckersly in the th  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs while
Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two

In the post game interview on WJR radio in Detroit Sparky Anderson said
its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career  It
was a big moment for him and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously
very happy for him  And what a way to get number 

Considering the circumstances I think it might be appropriate to say

                WOOF      Go Tigers

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco circa Sep ' and Jose Canseco
circa June 

  He's bulked up too much  Period  He needs to LOSE about  pounds
    not gain more bulk

I've been saying that for at least  years now and even the A's conditioning
guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his backAlthough I don't for one second believe Jose used steroidshis
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their framesee Jeff
Bregel ex er as a textbook example and IMHO Jose is too big for his
frame


  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED  Conservatively I'd say he's
    lost  of his bat speed and that's a HUGE amount of speed

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that
Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back


  That open stance is KILLING him   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is
    released  Downing could do this without significant head movement 
    Canseco can't  Also note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes
    they're fully closed  Without a good starting point it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing

I don't know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the A's and had no problems with it then It might be that preback
problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism if you're
cold its a hitch 

First minimize movement before the swing  Close and widen the stance
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing  Hopefully this
will cut down on the time I need to swing and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely

The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable
with for more than a few months He changes his stance so much he loses
track of where the strike zone is In Wednesday's night game he was 
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
he's changed his stance so much

I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns he'll become competitive swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits

 I think most of the problems mainly arose from Manager Gene Mauch's
 ineptitude in managing the pitching staff  Down the stretch he
 abused Jim Bunning Chris Short and Robin Roberts I think those
 are the three pitching each on only  days rest for quite some
 time  By the time they hit the last  weeks of the season
 obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm  Oh
 well

Roberts was long gone  he was probably an Oriole in   Or maybe a
Colt   The rd starter was Art Mahaffey the previous year's ace
Dennis Bennett was the th starter

They were indeed  up with  to go but they won their final two
games after the horrid loss streak  The final game victory
Bunning's th win if memory serves kept the Reds from tying for the
title they and the Phils were both  game behind the Cards with the
Giants another game back  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead
against the Cards that final Sunday or there would have been a way
tie  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the  or so runs they
scored on Saturday when they crushed St Louis

NoHal McRae is the worst manager in baseball

I haven't seen enough Royals' games to judge his tactics so you may have
a point here  But

I've never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can  One of the best
rawtalent staffs in the league and he's still finding a way to lose

IMO the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae
suddenly began channeling for John McGraw  OK they have some decent
pitchers  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind
and McReynolds and McRae and an overthehill Brett you're not going
to finish  unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him

I'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck

with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but

Does any one out there listen to WFAN  For those of you who do
not know what I am talking about it is an all sports radio
staion in New York  On a clear night the signal reaches up and
down the East coast  In particular I want to know how Len
Berman and Mike Lupica's show is  I go to school in Virginia
so I can't listen when there are on during the day  Just
wondering

You're right about the signal being strong I live in West Philadelphia
and I can get FAN almost perfectly It's a sports fans dream especially
if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's
away at school As for Lupica  Berman it's turned out to be Lupica
then Berman Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show so Ed
Coleman and Dave Sims' old fourhour slot was broken down into two
seperate twohour show  Lupica from  and Berman from  And they
both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave  COME BACK GUYS


The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station but doesn't come close to

might not be as powerful but then again only stations in New York
feel obligated to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of
hoodlum Mets fans complaining  hours a day  WIP took two of your
best sports jockeys too Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks  
WIP is rockin with sports talk from  AM till midnight check it
out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia  If I'm not
mistaken WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation


Like I said I live in Philly so I can hear FAN andor WIP whenever I
want But I cannot stand WIP And it isn't because I loathe the Philly
sports teams  the Phillies are my favorite NL team Yanks are favorite
AL and the Eagles aren't too bad either There are two big problems

	Total emphasis on the home teams especially the Eagles Unlike
	  the FAN hosts who can at least answer a question about an
	  outoftown team if a caller asks the WIP hosts seem
 	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on
	  Broad Street Also FANs periodic sports updates every 
	  minutes gives sports news and scores from around the
	  country It's very rare to hear an outoftown score
	  being reported on WIP

	The hosts With the exception of Jody MacDonald who I miss
	  from his days at FAN none of the hosts really seems to have
	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good onair presence
	  The worst is Gary Cobb who seems to have been hired solely
	  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles

Anyway that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle

I just love how the Alomar fans left RBIs off this list  Give me a break

  Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
on the team To a large extent If Frank Thomas hit first he'd lose a LOT
of RBI's and anyways how many nd place hitters have you known to drive
in  runs Doesn't happen that oftenvery unlikely with Devon White's
 OBP in front of you

we were for some reason trying to come up with names of Jewish
baseball players past and present  We weren't able to come up
with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
humor us  Thanks for your help

Thanks

Hank Greenberg would have to be the most famous because his Jewish
faith actually affected his play missing late season or was it world

 I would tend to call the offensive contributions even but Alomar wins hands
 down in defensive capabilities  I'm not just talking about the number of 
 errors nobody including Lind has the range and athleticism at second base
 I can't recall in the recent past anyone turning the double play better
 than Alomar  

Well why don't you look up those stats  Baerga may not be the best defensive
second baseman in the league but he's damn good  Check the stats for DPs
last year and see for yourself

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league while Alomar had the worst
However Alomar had a higher Defensive Average  So who would be better

Using Alomar's opportunities  groundballs  possible double plays
Alomar had  groundouts and turned  DPs
Baerga would have had with same DA  DP  groundouts and  DPs

Using Baerga's opportunites  groundballs  possible double plays
Alomar would have had with the same DA  DP  groundouts and  DPs
Baerga had  groundouts and  DPs

Baerga looks better though it's possible his DP would be lower with a 
different SS

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays however  Alomar
has established a high level of defense Baerga has not  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year but last year Baerga was just as good overall

	Glad you asked  The Ackman and nine of his relatives are currently
impersonating the Baltimore Orioles pitching staff  Personally I believe 
that the Evil Ackers kidnapped the real O's staff and are currently in the
process of impersonating Mussina Sutcliffe McDonald Olson 

	No no no The Ack man is apparently an alien lifeform much
like the pod people from planet Mars who can take on any form the
ability remains the same however The Ackpeople have been spotted on
many teams to date but it appears that the Orioles staff mentioned
above and the Expos bullpen Barnes Walton Fassero Gardiner and
Rojas have been the prime target Apparently John Wetteland was roughed
up by the Ackpeople during spring training due to the fact that his
system rejected the takeover and has been on the DL ever since Contact
the authorities This evil plot must be stopped the Ackpeople can
keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman though I enjoy watching Toronto fans
suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal

Uh right  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI barring a HR with
nobody on base  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good  I use the phrase happened to be advisedly
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to turn it up a notch in clutchRBIwhatever situations and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an
ability to any measurable extent  There are no clutch hitters  People who
tend to do things that would cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position  

My mistake

I agree

Me too RBI are a worthless stat Of course so is stolen bases because 
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run And of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases
so batting average slugging and obp out too  Hmmm i guess homers would
not count then either
My point RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is And no stat or lack
of can tell me there are no clutch hitters Maybe no stat CAN tell me
either but some people are I just know it

Back in September I was listening to WIP and I remember the morning
guys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell  The topic of conversation
was a new ball park for the Phillies  The location for this new park
was suggested to be near th St Station  At the time the mayor was
optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality  Has
there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream
I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead such as the
new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II  But it would be
nice to see this a reality  It is planned that the Phillies leave
the VET and leave it solely to the Eagles and if that's the case
the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium but that's another
story  I want to see that day

      Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it
 I
  
 mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
 as
 
 is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell
 
 Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
 Eddie
 
 Murray and Jeff Reardon

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points
However I think you approached this the wrong way I believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does I
feel they were all much better players I am not saying I fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more 

IMHO 
Dave Kingman  definately not They guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag The rest of his career I do not
think he was very feared by pitchers I also do not think he did a lot for the
game I mean really I am a Met fan  he was a Met for part of his career and I
still would not back him for the Hall of Fame

Dave Winfield  I think so He is feared by pitchers he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
in my opinion  without stats better than Kingman's probably by quite a
bit I also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader I think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society Examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done I know some of this from when he
was with the Yankees I think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I
think it deserves some consideration

Lee Smith  Maybe I would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of Kingman

Darrell Evans  No

Eddie Murray  Maybe He has had a very good career he is a leader although
a silent one he is a good role model Are the stats good enough I am not
sure  but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both
the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as Winfield's Just
think Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years

Jeff Reardon  My guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers Off the
top of my head I would take Lee Smith first

 
      Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
 giving
 
 Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards
 marginal
 
 Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there They're both
 
 shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal
 

Well I strongly disagree here Both of these guys deserve it for sure I
talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season Robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers
offensively The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop  he would have
shattered Aaron's home run mark by now How many of those great plays saved
games How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game While I believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more
than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers
Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame As does
George Brett who also belongs in this class of player

      Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors
 so
 
 liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if
 something
 
 isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When
 
 certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
 
 candidates the absurdity is apparent Gee can these guys even compare to
 
 the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan
 

Steve Garvey  I am not sure probably not but I guess I could see someone
making a case for him 

Jack Morris  Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might
bring up his name

Kirby Puckett  Probably The only reason I do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career If he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately

Nolan Ryan  Is there really any doubt I think I heard something about him
having some  records maybe they were not all good  I don't know I did not
hear any of them just the number He has the numbers he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model I would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even
top  but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame
because of his accomplishments nohitters strikeouts respectable numbers 
even with some weaker teams you can go on and on I really hope he gets ALL
the possible votes

So in summing up I have  groups those that belong those that probably do
but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go

Yes   Winfield Yount Brettnot in your mail O Smith Puckett and Ryan
Maybe  Murray and L Smith
No  Reardon Garvey Morris Evans and definately Kingman

As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this
up  these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions

second basemen in history He probably didn't even have as good a season as
Alomar last year

Guess which line is which
	BA	OBP	SLG	AB	H	B	B	HR	BB
X									
Y									

The walks should give it away  OBP's in general somewhat more valuable than
slugging and Alomar's edge in OBP was quite a bit larger than Baerga's edge
in slugging

I'm no SDCN but what's more valuable

 hits w more doubles  more HRs   OR
 more triples and  BBs  Let's not forget the  extra SBs How many CS

Of course the  hits and  homers are more valuable

But don't forget the  outs  You can't have it both ways Baerga's higher
raw numbers are due to him having more playing time and thus he had more
hits and homers but don't forget the cost of those outs

BTW just to answer your question Alomar had  SB and  CS Baerga had
 SB and  CS which gives a minute plus on Alomar's side

Something else to consider

Alomar's HR splits were  SLG  OBP Baerga's was 
and  Pretty clearly Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park

I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now TP
rated Baerga higher actually

There is Ebbets Field Flannels in Seattle which makes lots of minor and negro
league jackets and jerseys These things are REAL spendy around  for a
jersey but they are very authentic in look and nicely made

Paul long live Steve Bilko and the PCL LA Angels

Their phone number is  The last catalog shows three 
Oaks jerseys  Home  Home  Home  they're each   All their
merchandise is handmade and is an authentic replica  I own a couple 
and they are excellent They also have wool caps and jackets  You should
call to get on their mailing list even if you can't afford their prices

Compiled from the last five Defensive Average reports here are the career
DAs for the individual players in the reports  Stats are courtesy of
Sherri Nichols  Players are listed in descending order

And some comments with some players deleted

Third Basemen


Name                            
Mitchell Kevin                 
Yep that Kevin Mitchell  I never would have expected him in the
 spot

Gonzales Rene                  
It's no accident that the first two names are  only  As with first
and second base  was the year of the glove  Average DA was  points
higher in both leagues than any other year

Leius Scott                    
Looks good  Too bad he's moving to short

Pendleton Terry                
Highest fiveyear regular though he's only had one year as good as Kevin
Mitchell 

Ventura Robin                  
Wallach Tim                    
Gruber Kelly                   
The other elite fielders in the league

Pagliarulo Mike                
This is an interesting line  His  figure was slightly below average
His  was pathetic and his  was the next best year by anybody  Part of
that may be his mobility   was with the Yankees   was with the
Padres who appear to have a rotten infield   was with the Twins and
judging by Leius and Gaetti the Metrodome may be a good place to play
third

Williams Matt                  
Add another to the elite fielders list

Caminiti Ken                   
Sabo Chris                     
Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value  I don't know
what happened to Caminiti  judging by the three previous years his low
 may be a fluke  Sabo is merely average however  His incredible 
best year ever brings his average up a lot

Buechele Steve                 
Strange last two years

Schmidt Mike                   
According to reputation one of the best fielders ever at third base
But at the end he was below average  Average in  was 

Boggs Wade                     
Boggs has been pretty good  I don't know what happened in  but every
other year he has been above average usually by quite a bit

Martinez Egdar                 
Last year  a fluke or a portent

NL Average                    
Seitzer Kevin                  
AL Average                    
Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close
to one another but very different from year to year  Any ideas

Jacoby Brook                   
Brook  is declining

Hansen Dave                    
Magadan Dave                   
Jefferies Greg                 
Three firsttime regulars above average in   I'm not sure why Jefferies
gets all the grief about his fielding  He's never had a good year but while
at second he improved to become an average fielder and is an average fielder
at third

Zeile Todd                     
Zeile on the other hand is a below average fielder  Each year he's about
 points below average  And it's probably not just the park since Terry
Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this

Baerga Carlos                  
Moving back to second was a good idea

Hayes Chris                    
So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively  He's had a grand total
of one year above the league DA and was pretty bad last year

Johnson Howard                 
Lansford Carney                
Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford  separated at birth  To his credit
HoJo did have one above average year   Lansford couldn't even break
the  mark without the help of the year of the glove

Hollins Dave                   
Good hitter but his fielding needs work

Sheffield Gary                 
Not a good fielder

Blauser Jeff                   
Fryman Travis                  
Both are better off at shortstop

Gomez Lee                      
Two consecutive horrible years for Leo  Camden Yards doesn't seem to
have helped his fielding any  

Palmer Dean                    
Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA but the lowest
DA at third ever  Congratulations Dean

Well the Red Sox have apparenly resigned Herm Winningham to a AAA contract
Ted Larry Simmons signed him to a AAA contract then released him from
Buffalo allowing Lou Curly Gorman to circumvent the rule about not
resigning free agents until May  Clearly neither of these guys is bright

 reference to history because he certainly didn't have the best season for    
 second basemen in history He probably didn't even have as good a season as
 Alomar last year
   
 What  Do you have some measure like popularity in Toronto doesn't count
 that you are basing this statement on
 
 Uh yes  Baerga has a lot of flash but Alomar was the better hitter
 last year
 
 BATTERS        BA   SLG   OBP   G  AB   R   H  TB B B HR RBI  BB  SO SB CS  E
 BAERGAC                            
 ALOMARR                              
 

This is fascinating  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last 
year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga
had a better year  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP

 Hmmmwhat about walks and SB Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and
beat him in SLG by a lesser margin Even putting aside any other factors
a player with a  point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with
a  point edge in SLG The issue has been studied before and I doubt you
could come up with any convincing argument the other way
 People see the batting average and the HR but they don't really know  
their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely The fact is that
Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar while Baerga was making outs
Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter Winfield etal

   Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
 on the team To a large extent If Frank Thomas hit first he'd lose a LOT
 of RBI's and anyways how many nd place hitters have you known to drive
 in  runs Doesn't happen that oftenvery unlikely with Devon White's
  OBP in front of you
I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once  I know someone
will correct me if I'm wrong  

RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  You
can talk about OBP and SLG all you want but the fact remains

	The team that scores more runs wins the game

 Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball
 
 For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game
 
 With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed
 hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers
 
 Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
 lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
 Alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  What the Hell
 is he thinking

Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year
Lankford injured himself in a previous game and Torre was resting
him

As far as the WhittenGilkey controversy  Whitten adds some more
needed power and if Jordan continues to hit the way he has been
Gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough

     Actually I kind of liked the Abott trade We did trade the rookie of  
the year SNOW but with Don mattingly at first for another  years Why  
bother

I'd be willing to make two wagers
 Snow doesn't win ROY
 Mattingly is out of baseball within five years

I'm skeptical of the first because I don't think Snow is that good a
player and he is on a losing team

I'm skeptical of the second because of his back  Mattingly is  this
year and how many players play until they are   Not too many and
most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 

Could be wrong on either or both but I think that's the smart way to
bet

My point RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is And no stat or lack
of can tell me there are no clutch hitters Maybe no stat CAN tell me
either but some people are I just know it 

I was hoping somebody would mention clutch  Clutch  Baerga  The
two words simply do not go together  With runners in scoring
position Baerga batted  last year  This doesn't quite
suck but most batters hit better in this situation

Alomar  He hit  with runners in scoring position

The difference  Alomar had  RBIs in  such AB  Baerga had 
RBIs in  such AB  Baerga got  more chances yet succeeded only
 more times

Frankly I don't believe in clutch  But if I did my vote would
go to Alomar for MVP let alone best B in the AL

     Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it
I
mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
as
is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell
Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
Eddie
Murray and Jeff Reardon

Unfortunately you seem to lack the ability to rate players  Dave
Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of
Fame  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top  players
of all time  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career
of any relief pitcher since  with the possible exception of Gossage

On the other hand Kingman probably isn't one of the best  players
of all time

And Reardon though a good pitcher isn't in Smith's class career wise

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving
Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards
marginal

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there They're both
shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal

We're talking  of the top  players of all time here  There probably
aren't  shortstops in history who were better than these two

     Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors
so
liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if
something
isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When
certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
candidates the absurdity is apparent

Garvey sucked  Morris while a very good pitcher simply doesn't
belong near Cooperstown

 Gee can these guys even compare to
the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

If Puckett and Ryan okay no if there get into to the Hall they will be 
marginal Hall of Famers unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for
a while longer

To put this in perspective here's a listing of the linear weights
values of the careers of the players you mention  In parenthesis
is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it
While no one would claim these are perfect rankings they should give
you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players

Robin Yount  
Ozzie Smith  
Dave Winfield  
Eddie Murray  
Darrel Evans  
Kirby Puckett  
Nolan Ryan  
Jack Morris  
Dave Kingman  
Steve Garvey 

To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall
Of the  eligible players whose career stats equaled   are in the Hall
of Fame The ones who aren't include  th century players Ron Santo Bobby
Grich and Bob Johnson

Of those eligible who score between  and   of  are in  Of
those eligible who score between  and   of  are in

In a Philadelphia Inquirer a few days ago it was reported that there were
two  plans for a new Phillies stadium  the alreadymentioned th
Street Station proposal and a location near Broad Street and Race Street
I think  I can't remember the exact details but the stadium would be
build practically downtown  There is a small lot that could be used
according to the paper  The th street plan has run into some trouble
because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to
accomodate the stadium  I don't have an opinion just yet just letting
everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now
Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon however because
nobody wants to pay for it

One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't
yet been addressed  I believe the rule also does not deal with this
situation

If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up
and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball

However if the Infield Fly is not caught at what point can a
runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early  When the
ball hits the ground  When a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground

Enlightenment would be appreciated

September ' is still a painful thing to remember But I can tell you
that the Phillies never led the league by  that year Going by memory
alone I believe their biggest lead was   games and they were
  ahead when the famous game losing streak began a streak
during which it seemed that they found just about every way to lose
known to man Anyway I think they rebounded just before the end and
won their last couple games and were still in the thing until the
final day but finished tied with the Giants one game out And didn't
the Dodgers or somebody else finish two games back That has to be
one of the closest last minute scrambles ever

OK you guys stirred up my childhood memories so I went and did
some research on the final month or so of the  season It turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate at least as

Philadelphia            
Cincinnati              
San Francisco           

Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused at least by the fourman rotation standard of
the day until well along into the game losing streak at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day  shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant Bunning pitched
a complete game sixhitter striking out five and walking one It
would be inetersting to see though how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 
through October  while they didn't play substantially more games than
the other teams the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch

  Well after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesotainduced cabin fever
I've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games this
weekend A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension 
but I thought Why not go to Wrigley for a game too  

  I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat  start I believe
that's Eastern time listed I figured it would be fun to bounce down to
Wrigley for the day game and live it up a little I'm wondering if anyone
esp Cubbie fans have some advice on 

   If I'm taking  Skokie Hwy south until it runs into  what's the 
     best way to get to Wrigley I'm planning on getting there an hour or  
     two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy 

   Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats  or
      on game day I figure since it's early in the year Ryno's out and 
     the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets If not what's 
     the best way to get advance tickets can I call the Cubs' ticket office
     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window  

   Any advice on where to eat before or after the game 

   Do they allow inflatable Iluvewe dolls present from Lundy into the 
     bleachers

Anyway the worst pitcher on the Yanks If you mean currently on the team
then I have to go with Scott I'm a schizophrenicNo I'm NOT
Kamienicki Sure occasionally the guy can pitch well for  or  innings
but then he starts to go insane A sure sign that he's losing his stuff
and his mind is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters
and yell at himself

The worst alltime Yanks pitcher  Gotta go with Ed New York I have to

RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  You

So what does that have to do with RBI's  The team with the most RBI's
doesn't necessarily win the game

Yes runs are the most important statistice  for a team  So why does
every newspaper rank team offense by batting average

But for an individual player runs and RBIs are contextdependent and tell
us very little about the player himself and more about his teammates and
position in the batting order

And one Rockie will finish in the top  of an offensive catagory this

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below

I Love it how all of these people are blaming the Phillies success

that is all we have to go on  Atlanta is just so strong with their

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers

Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  What the Hell
is he thinking

For your information Lankford is injured I think it is his shoulder or rib
cage so he could not use him as a pinch hitter
 
Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench  Gilkey hit over  last year
what does he have to do to start The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards  He does
not have too much offensive capabilities but he is an awesome defensively
Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense
I forgot who St Louis gave up for him but it was not too much
 
As far as Gilkey is concerned he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan who
beat him out  I expect to see a GilkeyJordan platoon in LF
 
Furthermore in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home

I agree with you on this one  As soon as Larkin threw that ball I knew that
Lankford was a dead bird  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make
a perfect throw
 
I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball  Don't
forget the overachieving Cards of ' that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place although they were oveshadowed by the Braves
Twins last to first climb  He won a division title and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the Braves why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I
will never understand  With Torre at the controls the Cardinals are heading
in the right direction
 
One more thing one game does not make a season  Yes they lost to the Reds
but with the second best pitching staff in the National League first in the
East and a pretty good offense the Redbirds will win a lot more than they
lose  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way

Does anybody in the Pittsburgh area know why Mike LaValliere was released
Last year I kept saying that Slaught should get the bulk of the playing time
that he was clearly the better player at this point but Leyland insisted on
keeping a pretty strict platoon  And now he is released  That doesn't
make any sense to me

Greg

    The story goes like this

       Spanky is too slow  If he were quicker he would still be here
But with Slaught and Tom Prince they didn't want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that th pitcher  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely

      Don't feel too bad for him  He's still gonna get theat 
over the next two years  he'll be able to do most of what he wants to
do

 Not clear to me at all  I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
  games than  games  In the  game luck is going to play a much
 bigger role than in the  game 

But you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to
one run

Was going over some videos last night


And you wrote an excellent report about it


  He's bulked up too much  Period  He needs to LOSE about  pounds
    not gain more bulk

  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED  Conservatively I'd say he's
    lost  of his bat speed and that's a HUGE amount of speed

  That open stance is KILLING him   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is
    released  Downing could do this without significant head movement 
    Canseco can't  Also note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes
    they're fully closed  Without a good starting point it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing


I understand from an unreliable source that Canseco was considered
expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance  The A's brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated if not caused by having a wide open
stance closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
that's a paraphrase of what I remember

In any event Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power



Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch
so that I'd never have to work again I'd restructure my entire swing

Apparently you sound like LaRussa

Second drop  pounds  Cut out the weight work

The A's also objected about this


If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems he'll be out of baseball in three years  If not he could
still hit  HR

Again I'm just repeating something I heard  But possibly the cause
and effect is the reverse of that

I'd be willing to make two wagers
 Snow doesn't win ROY
 Mattingly is out of baseball within five years

I'm skeptical of the first because I don't think Snow is that good a
player and he is on a losing team


I don't have a history handy but I don't recall that the preponderance
of ROY's come from winning teams  In fact I think team performance is
generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins
Am I wrong

And he is not necessarily on a losing team  While the Angels' staff
is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank
you  Snow is playing great  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments
Easley appears fine but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up
Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady  Even Myers and Orton are contributing

Personally I think they can finish over  which makes them a 
winning team




	The Beastmaster 



I'm skeptical of the second because of his back  Mattingly is  this
year and how many players play until they are   Not too many and
most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 

Could be wrong on either or both but I think that's the smart way to
bet

Cheers

I'm no Kingman fan  Just thought I'd point out that he's the
only player in history to have five threeHR games  Joe Carter
has four  Eddie Murray three  McCovey and Gehrig also three
Ruth Mays Foxx and Dawson two each

I don't think Reggie's WS game counts else I believe he would 
also have had two

RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics

Actually they're pretty worthless if you want to evaluate players
with stats  RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned all they do is
confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself  

  You
can talk about OBP and SLG all you want but the fact remains

	The team that scores more runs wins the game
	

Uh so

You've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players
Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game
Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods
which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored  that's
where OBP SLG Runs Created Linear Weights etc come in  These
simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's
offensive contribution to the team's runs scored

Thank you for making our case  Have a nice day

No he's not nuts WIP is second to none THE sports station  They
don't have Tony Bruno working ESPN radio and Al Morganti doing Friday
Night Hockey because they suck  I live in Richmond Va but I visit
Phila often and on the way I get WTEM Washington and WIP  I hear
the FAN at night wherever I go the signal used to be WNBC when they
played golden oldies because you can't avoid it  Of those three
WIP has the best hosts hands down  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer
and neither is Jody Mac  WTEM is too generic to be placed in the
catergory  In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice the
theme music is identicalsame ownership I think so  WIP is
totally original  Their hosts actually have a personality this is a
knock at TEM the TEAM not the FAN because Mike and the Mad Dog and
Sommers are good I mean comparing the morning guys in Philadelphia
to the ones in Washington is a total joke  Anyway I like the FAN
and WIP but I think the edge goes to 'IP  

When I get back from Philly I go into withdraw cause Richmond has
nada except the national sports line and those guys are totally
clueless   
I was really mad when WCAU was cancelled because they had Steve
Fredericks doing sports phone after the Phillies games  WCAU is
another strong station now it's an oldies station but they still
have the Phillies I started listening to the FAN because I heard he
went there  I finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the same
guy  Those NY fans got to him  I was glad to hear him back in
Philly when I went to see a few Eagles games  


I will admit I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically an
Eagles station  days a year  BUT I bet you the Phillies are in
control right now


About the knock on G Cobb I like him  He knows the Eagles like a
book  I remember the weekend before they went to play San Fran
when everyone thought the Eagles would be blown away Cobb said that
the Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win
Well they were inches shy of pulling the victory  

Well that's my

Since someone brought up sports radio howabout sportswriting

Anyone give an opinion 

Which city do you think has the best sports coverage in terms of
print media 

these are general questions 

Is the Washington Post better than the Philadelphia Inquier or the NY
Times  

Howabout the Philadelphia Daily News compared to the New York Daily

Do you notice papers being subjective or objective to the home team

Something else to consider

Alomar's HR splits were  SLG  OBP Baerga's was 
and  Pretty clearly Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park

Not necessarily  It could mean that or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road see Frank Thomas' homeroad
splits in ' for an example  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence
There's no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and
Alomar is not a home run hitter

I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now TP
rated Baerga higher actually

Only because of tP's bogus fielding stats which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league  On a career basis I think TP's
fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is but he sure isn't the worst in baseball

Offensively TP rate Alomar much higher last year

Regarding the A vs B argument I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future

I don't have a history handy but I don't recall that the preponderance
of ROY's come from winning teams  In fact I think team performance is
generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins
Am I wrong

Not really though I wouldn't personally say the most deserving
candidate wins  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid
season and there have been several duds in recent years  But this is
more a factor of mediot biases than anything else  I wonder  If
Amaral hits like he is capable of will he receive ROTY votes  He's
only  he could have a long career ahead of him  

And he is not necessarily on a losing team  While the Angels' staff
is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank
you  Snow is playing great  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments
Easley appears fine but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up
Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady  Even Myers and Orton are contributing

Personally I think they can finish over  which makes them a 
winning team

I think they are a seconddivision team  They should finish ahead of
the Royals Mariners and possibly Athletics  But I don't think
they'll be above   I think the East is stronger this year

Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible  This
year their offense is better but their pitching is still pretty bad
Even if Finley returns to form he won't replace what they lost in
Abbott  Sanderson  Farrell  I don't believe it

And while their BA may be good and they have decent speed their
offense lacks punch  They don't have any bona fide power hitters
Salmon Snow Davis and Curtis  None with more than  HR
potential

Cheers
Valentine

PS Which AL team had the most steals last week  Those gogo Tigers
The mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed more
balance in their lineup  You see they were scoring too many runs
too consistently  Gotta run more to break that up

 Not clear to me at all  I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
  games than  games  In the  game luck is going to play a much
 bigger role than in the  game 

But you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to
one run

Yeah but what's your point  You still need the offense to score more runs
than you allow too  

The Braves do have a fine pitching staff  But that's still only half the
game

losing this guy who's been in AAA most of the last  seasons  The Pirates
released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options then

He's another year older and still can't hit why do they think he wouldn't

 I agree though I'd also be happy with a stadium that looks
 like new Comiskey The new park was also made for baseball
 Unlike Three Rivers the Vet Riverfront etc it's not a
 football park in which they also play baseball
 
While we're on the multipurpose subject let's not forget Shea which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets  Jets  It was the first
stadium I think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football

Of course with the Jets gone to Jersey and a truly good football
stadium the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where
because it's circular the seats are almost always too far from the
action  The Mets announcersKiner  Murphy in particularhave
always hyped it as beautiful Shea
Stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is

The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner  The ball cleared the threefoot high fence and
went into the crowd  Darryl racing over from right center got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he
missed the ball  A fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt
reached up and caught the ball  Home run

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry  What cannot be disputed however is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch

That exuberance disappeared immediately however when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and
just relocated him to another area  In an interview after the game
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning  LA Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play  Was the fan wrong  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference  Or was he human and just reacting  By the way he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of  rbi through the first
nine games

I question what he was doing in right center with a lefthanded pull
hitter up and the game on the line  Had he been closer to the play
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan

Went to the Dodgers game tonight  it was cap night
 
Astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all night
In the first he walked a batter balked him to second then
a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the
throw home  Another single made the score  Cards
 
Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler Reed And Piazza
batting third  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder
and Webster
 
Piazza homered in the first to make the score  Cards
The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single
by Offerman
 
By the fourth inning Astacio had already made about  pitches but
the score was still   The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive
plays  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate gunning down a runner
trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who
had strayed a bit from first base etc
 
Karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into
the outfield  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going
through he just kept running past second  Karros got up and threw
to third and EASILY got the runner at third
 
My heart sank in the th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen
 
Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when Gross entered the game
with the score still  Dodger fans just KNEW it was over
 
Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday pitching just  
innings forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen  The  inning
game had the same effect the next nightso only Gross was fresh
given his light work out Tuesday
 
Gross lived up to his name  He walked the first batter gave up a hit
to the second and walked the bases loaded  After a grounder resulted
in a force at home Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it
 Cards  Gross paid little attention to the runners and the next
thing you knew the Cards had stolen a fourth run  The runner on
first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the th run had
scored long before that
 
Meanwhile the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning
Lee Smith pitched the ninth  He had little trouble getting Karros
and Wallach does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days
Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger a single but
that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount  Smith got his
third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my
free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza  If Piazza keeps this
up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year
honors  Though its really early Karros is already showing signs
of a sophomore jinx year
 
The final scoreCardinals  runs on  hits
Dodgers  runs on  hits

Summary Lopez is better than current Brave catchers
Keywords Solid  good

In article mssCqADtvnetcomcom mssnetcomcom Mark Singer writes
In article Aprcscornelledu tedwardcscornelledu Edward Ted Fischer writes

I'm still catching up from Spring Break but bear with me

in the bigs especially when they haven't even played AAA ball  We
certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but
there is really no need to rush him especially since we have a mega
million dollar staff that is probably well served by a batterymate
who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling  Lopez'
time will come  Let's give him some time in AAA


Javy Lopez has proven over  AB in the minor leagues that he is
ready to play in the majors He is not being rushed Players who are
clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level
are wasting their time and may actually have a court case against
major league management for keeping them at AAA

No  Maybe I need to improve my writing skills  Lopez who is very
ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age 


Unless Lopez is me defensively I'm '''  and born to play
second base  he belongs in the major leagues

training  What does he have to do to earn a chance  Maybe not a full
time job but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove
his worth

Gee  I don't know   abs sounds pretty good to me  About as good
as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather
than start every day at AAA  Talk about me as a GM

Valentine isn't saying he should back up He's saying he should be put
in a position to win the job in the major leagues which IMHO he
would if given the opportunity Val if I'm misinterpreting please
let me know

So far you have come up with two arguments against Lopez
 He is very ordinary defensively
 He is young and most players suck when they are young

The first is irrelevant  He's trying to make the majors with his bat
And the second involves seriously warped reasoning

Valentine

OK  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age  see current
related posting on Clayton one of my favorites  Most players 
benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at AAA
Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their
clubs in the bigs  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the
Braves for this year

But the players who are ready are the best and  the ones most
likely to benefit from being in the majors Javy Lopez is not a middle
oftheroad prospect He's the real thing NOW 

Again the most important thing a player can do is hit Lopez does that
miles better than Olson or Berryhill If his defense is good enough for
Greenville or Richmond it's good enough for Atlanta If he really was
awful defensively he would no longer be a catcher See Sprague Ed

Now  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out
runners  Not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans
The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the
outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid MVP candidate
at third and one of the better hitting shortstops  The center
field platoon will probably hit   However good Lopez'
what they have to offset the differential in experience and 
defensive ability  The kid will improve playing at AAA and
he probably won't being a reserve with the big club  

Oh where to start OK First of all solid  good I want good players
Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really
aren't very good at baseball Think of it as TWG without the caps
It's a losing strategy to say We have solid guys we don't need to improve
You used it four times in that paragraph BTW

Same for experienced I might add though that Greg Olson and Damon
Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk Olson has played three years
Berryhill five although  and  were a wash The only difference
IMHO between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast

Two big bats Hrm I like Justice but I find Mr Gant's trend disturbing
Call it one and a maybe The Braves' platoon is OK but neither player
has any value outside of the platoon Bream vs LH and Hunter vs RH
are awful I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone Pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already If the CF platoon hits  I'll retrace
Mr Likhani's midnight run down Forbes and I live in NY and LA
Got that Mike

And doesn't Cox call pitches anyway

goodness  Do you believe the other poster who thinks Lopez
is being held down because of his future earning potential
Why on earth do you people thinkthe Braves made this decision
Are they idiots who have built this ballclub  Jeeeesh

Nope They're baseball management possible the most shortsighted 
collection of people in the nation Do you not believe this goes on
Mark Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in
 Or Cal Eldred wasn't really better than Ricky Bones last year

And I'm the treasure

You're mostly polite make defensible if flawed cases have wit and
have in the past admitted being wrong That does qualify you on rsb
We'll make an SDCN out of you yet

Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the
BB DDD this year I expect the Phillies staff while getting the wins
would have to rank up there Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among
the early league leaders and all  of their bombs have come at the
Phils' expense Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater
prowess in the past 

How have the Rockies been early I know Mile High has produced a ton of 
runs but is it the launching pad everyone expected yet

 Uh yes  Baerga has a lot of flash but Alomar was the better hitter
 last year
 
stats deleted  we've all seen them by now
This is fascinating  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last 
year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga
had a better year  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP

I nominate this last bit for AntiStathead Quote of the Week

Alomar only has a  point advantage in the most important offensive
category while Baerga who studied in the Joe Carter School of OutBurning
has more impressive mediot stats largely due to opportunities rather
than quality

The lines are fairly close in value but edge to Alomar

Now Baerga ain't chopped liver but Alomar is still the man to beat among
AL second basemen

A lot of teams carry  catchers on their  man roster
but the rd catcher is seldom ever used  He is only
insurance in case of extra innings or the nd catcher
is injured during a game     So to free up this roster
spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever why not
invoke a catcher resubstitution rule

If the last roster catcher on a team is
injured during a game the team is permitted
to substitute in his place for defensive purposes
a catcher who has previously been yanked from
the game   

Given this rule a team wouldn't need  roster
catchers  The rd catcher could be playing
in AAA or be a nonroster bullpen catcher

so you want to decrease players' salaries

so you want to increase owners' salaries

the two are equivalent

bob vesterman


Only if you insist that the ticket prices cannot be adjusted downward
Or the taxes for the revenues to build the ballparks  Or the parking
charges  Or the concession costs  Etc


 why would owners decrease ticket prices when they obviously get
   lots of people to pay the price they're asking

 even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners
   decrease ticket prices that does not decrease the tv contract

bob vesterman

So what will happen when the tv contract runs out considering networks
have been losing money on it  Either ticket prices will go up or someones
salary will be cut or perhaps the local community or merchindise could make
up the difference  Baseball is probably facing a dramatic drop in income
very soon and someone will suffer probably the fans from higher ticket
prices but definitely someone

As a touter of Braves prospects all I can say is that IMO
someone on the Braves roster is about to become Pipped
It may not even be Hunter  But I think they'll have a
problem getting Klesko out of the lineup once he's in

Well this may be good news  If Klesko hits I'd look for Bream to be
traded if possible or released since Bream is also a lefthander  Hope
Klesko hits

According to the Atlanta paper Bream will be the fulltime first baseman
with Klesko used as a lateinning defensive replacement if Bream is lifted
for a pinchrunner He'd have to hit a homer in his first AB or win the
game or do some other amazing thing to be rewarded with a start so he could
even attempt to push Hunter or Bream out of the lineup

You are the first person  nonmediot  I have seen endorse this policy
I have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the

been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and
shouting Hurry up  If I cough up big bucks for a ticket I don't mind
a game that last more than   I really don't understand it

I agree with Nick  What's the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball there's that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games especially when
it's coming from TV people has to something to do with advertising
Probably time wasted in the middle of an inning say by a batter
stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves or by a pitcher
walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts could
otherwise be sold as advertising time

Not at all  I am talking about Morris winning with Toronto last year  You

last year  Morris did

The problem with your nihilistic approach Roger is that it takes all the
sense out of the game  By your line of reasoning if a guy hits into a
double play with one out and the bases loaded there's no point in saying
that that was a bad thing to do if his team won anyway or speculating
on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise so the double
play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was
eventually won or lost for unknown reasons  After all any speculation
involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't

Roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the
ceiling instead  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence

Teams go to the postseason when they win more games than anybody else
in their division  If they don't make the postseason they don't win the
Series  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate
goal in ringcollecting

If so you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal
towards winning the division and our disagreements come when we consider
how to win games

In your viewpoint as expressed winning games happens for reasons that
cannot be analyzed  While many of us are thinking things like Base
runners are good outs are bad and therefore walks are better than
double plays with the bases loaded you are thinking things like
It's a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious
team dynamics that will cause the team to win today

The result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual
players  Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left
field  After all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would
have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt
it  Therefore I could be an extremely valuable player  Did Dave Winfield
have anything to do with the Jays' victory  Probably but how do you know
If you replace him with Andres Galarraga perhaps the Jays would have won
perhaps they would have lost perhaps they would have defected to Alpha
Centauri bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed
in midseason had Winfield been DHing for Toronto

Was Babe Ruth a good player  He played on some WSwinning teams but did
he have anything to do with their success

It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player and
Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't  It seems to me that anybody who
would deny this needs to provide the proof

Now we have observed things about baseball over the years both empirically
and by looking at the rulebook  It is necessary to score more runs than
one's opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score runs
and to prevent one's opponent from scoring  Runs are scored while a team
is batting and an inning ends after the third out so it would seem that
making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good  Players have tendencies
to hit or pitch at certain levels and these are usually somewhat consistent
from year to year

We do use these statistics to predict winners and so do you  To make
some flat predictions  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBPSLG than
Gene Larkin this year  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies
in the standings  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals but
will also give up more  I would be astonished if any of these turned
out to be false and I suspect so would you  As a matter of fact I
am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year given
 guesses per division and this is certainly better than random
chance and almost statistically significant

If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in
the World Series you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure
likelihoods however fuzzy

It is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally
meaningless

So how about real life  Person A robs a service station with two people
in it using a  automatic pistol gets  and is convicted and sentenced
for three years  Person B with a similar criminal record robs a service
station with two people in it using a  revolver gets  and is
convicted  Since they used two different types of handgun are comparisons
totally meaningless

Say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works my cats are always
testing this  they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time  You
have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before so
all previous evidence is meaningless  Or would you be surprised if it flew
out the window instead of hitting the desk

However what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games

I agree with Nick  What's the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball there's that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write but
neither of you two sound as though you have kids and you may not have
spouses either

Consider a night game starting at  PM EST  It was  last year
but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back
I go and I'm into it until  PM minimum  Extra innings could put me
well past midnight  Even without extra innings if the score is beyond
 I can't see my family that night at all  If the next day is a workday
I may have to bag that as well  Further the later the game goes the
colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie

All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game  If
you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up IMPO you are 
saying you don't care where the time goes and that the game is for people
who don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day

Don't you GUYS think so  I mean c'mon  What the heck are women doing
even THINKING of getting into baseball  They cause so many problems  Just

Assuming you're serious I guess you'd be surprised to hear
that us GUYS don't think so I would guess that a tiny fraction
of  of the folks reading your post agree with it I kind of
doubt that even you agree with it

Sheesh  I agree with you here Dave  Anyone for starting
recsportsidiots for guys like Austin

No but I am for starting recsportsidiots for people who respond to obvious
flamebait

Nah let's reserve recsportsidiots for people who POST
obvious flamebait like yourself

If someone posts something as controversial not to mention
idiotic as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup
someone should challenge the statement  There is a school
of thought that suggests that silence  consent  Whereas
this idea may not apply to everything in life it certainly
SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion which rsb
is

If you've been reading rsb lately you'll find
that even elementary school children have had access
to our postings alibet in an edited form  It's making me
think a little more carefully about some of the things I post

In conclusion if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel
in some obscure newsgroup that I don't read fine  He's got the
right to rant rave and drool all he wants to in the name
of free speech  But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read
then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal
to his drooling

Now of course you don't have to read any of this
And if you want to cut down on flames then




DON'T POST FLAMEBAIT

kubeysgicom Ken Kubey said

I suppose a foul ball machine like Brett Butler is pretty valuable
but I'd rather watch and root for the lower OBP guys who can
actually hit the ball

Now this is a legitimate point  Baseball is entertainment and I have no
quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than
others regardless of their winvalue  Personally I'm a huge fan of the
slugbunt I doubt it's a highpercentage play but I get a big kick out of
it  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun

Of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that Galarraga's
inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he isn't
paid to walk or is an RBI guy or whatever

And finally I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them than because they have a great eye

I'm not sure  I used to think this was true but more and more I'm becoming
convinced that it's the other way around among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot

Let's break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot


			Power			No Power

	Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler
			Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith
			Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck
			Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins
			Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton
			Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost
			Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove
			   			   
			   			   
			   			   

	Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen
			Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston
			Joe Carter		Andres Thomas
			George Bell		Jose Lind
			Kirby Puckett		Devon White
	etc

As far as I can tell all the categories are full  It really looks like the
two are independent  Nobody could possibly be afraid of Craig Grebeck at
the plate and yet he walks quite a lot  Part of that undoubtedly is being
small of stature but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of 
target at least  times out of   Randy Milligan is an even better example
he's only shown noticeable power for one partial season but he walks all
over the place despite his huge strike zone

Some time back in this newsgroup I seem to recall a thread about
predicting the runs a given lineup of  batters could be expected
to score given the appropriate statistical alphabet soup for these
hitters OBP SLG AVG bat length hat size dayoftheweek
weather conditions etc    Anyway was I dreaming or is there
some such animal

My apologies if this has been covered recently I probably get to

that HE'D been thrown out  And Gant had a legitimate beef about
the  pitch that was called a strike  A reasonable umpire would
not have tried to FORCE Gant back into the box in that situation

A reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games  I for one am glad to see this happen and hope more
umpires will do as Hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if
the batter won't get back in the box  

So what if the previous strike call was bogus  It's in the past it can't
be changed get back in there and deal with the next pitch  

Sorry Sherri but I can't agree with this particular incident  While
I'm all for cutting down the number of chainrattles and other examples
of rampant Hargroving there was a difference here

  Since time immemorial batters have complained about calls
So have pitchers and catchers  Usually nothing happens
Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing
complaints Hirschbeck was acting against expectations

  It's not as if Gant was in Hirschbeck's face  Gant said
something about the call stepped out of the box and turned away
from Hirschbeck  As a hitter alibet of little consequence but
with a decent eye whenever receiving the short end of the stick
on a questionable call I'd want a moment or two out of the box
if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on
the experience of the last pitch  And if I was really angry
at the ump I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than
turn to him and say something that might get me tossed
especially at a key moment in the game

When Gant turned away Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant
to step into the box  IMO at this point in time Hirschbeck
was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game
Gant wasn't dawdling he hadn't had a chance to dawdle  And Hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play  Gant resisted as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and
Hirschbeck called for the pitch  At that point Cox came out on
the field the pitch was thrown and many other Braves left the
dugout  Cox was tossed protecting his player  I was pleasantly
surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game

It's a small sample size but based on what I saw in that game
Mark Hirschbeck has a hairtrigger temper and a need to play
God on the field  Not good qualities for an umpire  I will
keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the 
future in order to improve my sample size

IMO any game where you remember the name of the umpire was
a bad game for the umpire

We cannot isolate the total contribution that any player at any position
makes to his team's victory  And since we cannot make that measure with
complete confidence of objectivity and since there is no absolutely 
necessary reason to make that kind of subjective measurement I submit to 
you that it is pointless  If a GM is trying to put together a winning
team he might consider ERA he might consider attitude he might consider
past performance in key situations  But what he is looking for is not 
the player that he considers the best  The GM is looking for the player
he thinks can help his team win

We cannot isolate completely Roger but we can make a pretty good
estimate I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really
measure who was better Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga last year the
difference is too close to call But Larkin and Lee Clemens and
Morris The differences are too great there

In your measure of the game why should a team that has just won it
all ever replace a single player Since they are now clearly best
how can they do better Yet every team can always find someplace where
they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player
a little better than one they already have BTW by my definitions
the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team
win I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the
team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others

Baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents It is
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success
or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most
cases Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe
Carter Robby Alomar Tom Henke Juan Guzman John Olerud et al
Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as
Herm Winninham Luis Rivera and Jeff Reardon To define the quality
of the team as a sum of its components as I do albeit imperfectly
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the
mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you
do

A few weeks ago I posted about the Phillies team personalities  Did anyone see the ESPN feature on the Phils on Monday Night  John Kruk had a great line  He was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury  He said if they do they know we'll kick their ass  The 
time I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped  When I saw it at
they bleeped ass  Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of 
throwaways from other teams and that is why they are so close  Kruk said that
they all get along this year  Last year he said they hated the pitchers  I 
assume he was joking but he always keeps a straight face when he talks  Oh
What a team

Besides this stuff is EASY to find Baseball America puts out a book called
the Directory It's US Has every team's data and schedule in it If I
WERE to type in the whole scheudle I'd just be spending a lot of time
infringing on their copyright

Folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list

No but I am for starting recsportsidiots for people who respond to 
obvious flamebait

Nah let's reserve recsportsidiots for people who POST
obvious flamebait like yourself

Funny  I didn't realize Mr Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v Pam Postema
in the first place  Thought it was someone named Jacobs

If someone posts something as controversial not to mention
idiotic as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup
someone should challenge the statement  

Why  If a statement is truly idiotic and is universally thought so
the challenge is a waste of panting  Further challenges that have
nothing yes nothing to do with baseball are wasting others' time

You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks  Let's hear it in
some sort of categorical manner  Actually I question whether either
Knepper or Postema aren't old news at this point although what I
have read of Postema's book is interesting

There is a school of thought that suggests that silence  consent  

I agree this far

Whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life it certainly
SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion

Sez you

If you've been reading rsb lately you'll find
that even elementary school children have had access
to our postings albeit in an edited form  It's making me
think a little more carefully about some of the things I post

That does not come out in what you say down the road here

In conclusion if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel
in some obscure newsgroup that I don't read fine  He's got the
right to rant rave and drool all he wants to in the name
of free speech  But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read
then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal
to his drooling

Yo  Even elementary school children have had access to our postings
albeit in an edited form  You want them to hear you talk like this
Don't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think
you like to do the same  Or do you want them to think you're some 
politically correct demagogue who's ohso sensitive  Hohum

Plus you're here limiting free speech to some obscure newsgroup that
I don't read  What BS  You got a problem with what Jacobs says what
Knepper thinks all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas more
and better speech  Yours is the easy way out

As for Knepper ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about
any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of
them  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't
preprepared  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women they
pop some question about Postema  An interesting related question would 
be whether the two ever appeared in the same game  Off the top of my head
I guess no  If my guess is right Knepper popped off about something that
had nothing to do with him  and Postema gets a book for it and he doesn't

Now of course you don't have to read any of this
And if you want to cut down on flames then DON'T POST FLAMEBAIT
You don't have to respond to flames either  Saves cyberspace

Now why didn't I think of that

Quick name a

I bet you can name two dozen white ones
Otis Nixon
Stole  bases  Ok he's still lighthitting but baseball managers don't
think so they think he like Omar Moreno before him is a perfect leadoff
man  Awesome defense

Well yeah On the other hand for the first few years of his career he
looked like Herb Washington Dan Gladden doesn't seem to suck defensively
either

Darnell Coles
He's still around because of his  when he hit  HR
Yeah and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career
It's actually not an uncommon phenomenon and how long a guy hangs around
based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a
racial basis

Billy Hatcher
We'll see if he's still around in  for his tenth year
Hey he plays for Lou Gorman doesn't he OK so it's eight years

OK I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook but
only after the first  or  Oh and there's the alltime lighthitting
black outfielder Lou Brock Look it up And Curt Flood Cesar Geronimo
Cesar Cedeno 
Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease but he wasn't perceived as
lighthitting  Neither was Curt Flood  Cesar Cedeno was not light
hitting

Good point on Cedeno OTOH I haven't seen that extensive list of year
Dan Gladdens either There really aren't that many players altogether who
hang around for  years even if they're reasonably good

A reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games  I for one am glad to see this happen and hope more
umpires will do as Hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if
the batter won't get back in the box  


	A reasonable umpire would have recognized that Ron Gant was 
disturbed with the call  A reasonable umpire would have realized that
there was a run game in progress with two outs in the ninth  What
Ron Gant did was try to regain his composure  What a normal baseball
player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument
with the umpire and since you can't argue balls and strikes he would
have been ejected from the game  Ron Gant by trying to avoid such a
conflict was penalized for showing some restraint

	Incidentally a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been
so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire as Gant
requested  If the home plate umpire had appealed to first the first base
umpire could have wrung up the strike and Gant would not have been so
upset  If the call had been a ball and the catcher had requested the
appeal it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help

	Finally the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the socalled
efforts to speed up the game  The game was played very quickly it was
just at  hours when the stuff happened in the ninth and the only delays
in the entire game had been the result of actions by the umpires other than
Deion having to clean garbage off the field

We cannot isolate completely Roger but we can make a pretty good
estimate I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really
measure who was better Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga last year the
difference is too close to call But Larkin and Lee Clemens and
Morris The differences are too great there

In your measure of the game why should a team that has just won it
all ever replace a single player Since they are now clearly best
how can they do better Yet every team can always find someplace where
they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player
a little better than one they already have BTW by my definitions
the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team
win I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the
team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others

Well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that
Alfredo Griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs
to win while Larkin might not have that something the team needs
Would Griffin then be better than Larkin
 

Baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents It is
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success
or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most
cases Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe
Carter Robby Alomar Tom Henke Juan Guzman John Olerud et al
Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as
Herm Winninham Luis Rivera and Jeff Reardon To define the quality
of the team as a sum of its components as I do albeit imperfectly
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the
mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you
do

No I am not trying to define the quality of an individual at least not
for the purpose of ranking them  Toronto won with Olerud  They might
have won with Fielder  They might not have won with Thomas  Detroit
might have won with Thomas  Chicago might have won with Fielder  You
can't rank these individuals  You can only look at who might contribute
more to the team effort which is winning the WS  Thomas could not
have contributed to that goal any more than Olerud so I cannot say that
Olerud is less of a player

You want to speed up ballgames

  Enforce the two minutes between innings  As it is many fields are
    allowing THREE minutes between them  Fifteen seconds before 
    TV commercials are gone to Thirty or so before action begins upon
    the return to the game  Two minutes last out to first pitch or
    a ball is called

  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it  They may get
    pissed at first but they'll get in line once anything the pitcher
    throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike

  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches the current
    rule is too lenient and then enforce it  Fifteen seconds is more
    than enough time  If the pitch isn't released in  call it a ball
    and restart the clock

Baseball games take about  in the NL and just a shade under  hours
in the AL  That's just too damn long  I don't like to PLAY in  hour
games much less WATCH a game for that long  My butt falls asleep and

Just a refresherthe baseballs came on the field during Sunday's

	The garbage started hitting the field well before the Sunday
game  It started on Thursday or Friday I can't recall which games I
didn't watch on TBS  Deion was getting pelted with trash the whole
time it seemed  The announcers talked about the change in the seating
in the bleachers and how that made it easier for the events that

 nonmediot  I have seen endorse this policy  I have no problem with the
length of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd  and other announcers 
bitching about it  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking
at their watches and shouting Hurry up  If I cough up big bucks for a 
ticket I don't mind a game that last more than   I really don't
understand it  
	Games are longer now for several reasonsstuff deleted
	Maybe I am just a ne'erdowell with nothing better to do but I 
would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you

Well I don't want shorter games per se but I would like for them to stop
wasting so much time during games The Gant incident is a perfect example
When a guy comes to the plate he should be up there to hit not show off
or show up the umpire which is clearly what Gant was doing I feel like
writing a fan letter to Hirschbeck

The facts are that Morris
 has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning club
 Clemens hasn't 

What does it take to play on a WS winning club

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu
tion  from the rest of the team's  There is only one way of determin
ing best in baseball  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game  Each game determines which team is the best
that day  At the end of the season the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division  The playoffs determine the
best of the best  But the point is that the only decision making pro
cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re
lates to the teams  Not the individual players  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  And that
is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup  Sheer speculation  Impossible to ascertain

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria then fine  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS  because  that is the
only measure of best that has any meaning in the  context  of  base
ball   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub
jective  and  is  mere opinion  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon

The fact is that Morris didn't win any ballgames Toronto did in
spite of Morris' contribution   This has been explained to you

Exactly  The Jays won with Morris pitching   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about

many many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it

You don't have to be rude

You are completely consumed by the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy

For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy  Ignoratio
Elenchi  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   although  I  have  tongue in cheek claimed
that in the past  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced  So when a poster claims that Morris is better
than Clemens because he has more rings the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds

 I don't
 blame players like Galarraga Dawson and McGee when they swing at
 a strike and put the ball in play

Well no problem  But I get pretty annoyed when they swing at nonstrikes
and make outs  Especially ball four on the  counts

argument over reasonable players and umpires deleted

	Incidentally a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been
so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire as Gant
requested  If the home plate umpire had appealed to first the first base
umpire could have wrung up the strike and Gant would not have been so
upset  If the call had been a ball and the catcher had requested the
appeal it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help


Yes but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a
strike There was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal
Once he called it a strike the call could not be changed  

I thought that the umpire did the right thing

Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans ie the football crowd   Invariably all the
arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on TV say the
same thing  the games are too long and too boring  Baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider TV appeal  If you look at
it though baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games  The difference is that there is more action in that duration in
football games  Perhaps if there were more action in baseball games you
would get more of those fans to tune in  Anyway coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult
On soapbox Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since it's obvious
that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in
Nebraska Off soapbox

 You want to speed up ballgames

  Enforce the two minutes between innings  As it is many fields are
    allowing THREE minutes between them  Fifteen seconds before 
    TV commercials are gone to Thirty or so before action begins upon
    the return to the game  Two minutes last out to first pitch or
    a ball is called

  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it  They may get
    pissed at first but they'll get in line once anything the pitcher
    throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike

  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches the current
    rule is too lenient and then enforce it  Fifteen seconds is more
    than enough time  If the pitch isn't released in  call it a ball
    and restart the clock


I've only ever seen this called once  Back around   I think
that Steve Carlton was pitching  On the other hand I am not sure how
much effect this would have  It seems that most of the time lost is
when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this


I have wondered why a pitcher is given  pitches when he enters the
game  Let's be serious  The relief pitcher has normally been
throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes  Does he really need 
more pitches

It's certainly not very easy  What I do is use frame advance on the tape
and simply count the frames  Five times and try to throw out any outliers
It's not perfect but it's better than a blow to the head with a large
metal object

  Ah so you finally found a use for that super slomo and frame advance
other than scrutinizing Sorority Babes in Heat Congrats 

I wish I had FILMS instead of tapes preferably at fps rather than 
but while I'm at it I'd like to have ten million dollars and be able
to eat anything I want and never gain any weight either

  Trust me you'd have a helluva time manipulating them Besides if you
converted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the
difference in frame rate unless you're an expert at doing  pulldown for
a laserdisc company or something 

Gary's list of the ten slowest bats in baseball

  Hey no fair What about 'Fettucine' Alfredo Griffin The guy practically
has to pivot the bat around along with his body 

Gary's list of How the HELL can he hit like that

  Julio Franco
  Phil Plantier
  Darren Daulton

  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange He's a little bit quiet at 
the plate but like Franco gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane The first time I watched Julio Franco I didn't think anyone could
hit like that Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look every time he makes
contact it's solid He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch 

  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne'  Sure looks like it  

  How 'bout one to add to your list Travis Fryman The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing across his body He generates a lot of power but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips 

Gary's list of I'd give Dave Kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that

  Well they're already spoken for by several people but  

  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list among others I really like Dean
Palmer's swing for some twisted reason as well as Pedro Munoz's swing 

That's all for now  I'm looking at Derrick May's tapes tonight along
with Troy Neel's  That guy is a serious ox

  A thought about May It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball
IMHO he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he's going to see lots of sinkerssliders
low and away Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and leftcenter IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month

I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write but
neither of you two sound as though you have kids and you may not have
spouses either

I wonder why you say that  I don't see why having a spouse andor
kids would have anything to do with it  It might if you brought
your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get
to bed at a reasonable hour in which case I'd probably decide
to take my kids to games on weekends as many people do or else
be prepared to leave the game early but from what you say later
on you don't bring your kids or your spouse to the game
As it happens I have a husband but no kids and my husband usually
attends games with me

Extra innings could put me
well past midnight  Even without extra innings if the score is beyond
 I can't see my family that night at all  If the next day is a workday
I may have to bag that as well  

I can see it's a problem if you don't bring your wife to the ballgame
but that's a problem even if the game goes a trim   hours  As far
as bagging work the next day I don't really understand why that's
necessary unless going to a game also means that you consume vast
quantities of beer I note that this is the case for many guys
If you don't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening
out then don't have long evenings out during the week

All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game  If
you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up IMPO you are 
saying you don't care where the time goes and that the game is for people
who don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day

Look if I pay between  and  apiece for tickets plus  
for parking plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston 
plus spending additional money on concessions etc at the ballpark then 
I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money
I can't afford to go to a lot of games  Hence going to a game is a
big deal like going to a play or an opera  Maybe you have more money than 
I do and can go to games all year long so it's not such a big deal for you  
But I'm not interested in having games sped up any more than I want to
have Die Walkure cut down to a convenient weeknight version of two
hours  If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere 
with my family life or my work life then I'd choose to go to a weekend game

and also that Gant should have listened to him  However what is with this

I wholeheartedly endorse it

 I have no problem with the

Haven't been to many A's games have you

Seriously I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts
a long time because there is good baseball being played  However I don't
like  games that take  hours because there's a lot of dead time going
on in that game  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or
pitcher wander around between pitches or watching the catcher make a slow
walk to the mound or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason
Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this the game could be way out of
reach and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage  

I want to see the game not people standing around  I don't really enjoy
watching NFL football games in person for example because there's so much
dead time you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch
it on television because they're busy showing you replays  I don't like
that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game
the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next
year they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next
year and they're going to a  second clock  

There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm
watching them on the tube and if I'm going there in person  For me going
to an A's game has become a major commitment of time one that I'm not
willing to make that often  the length of their games is costing the A's
revenue from me

  Since time immemorial batters have complained about calls
So have pitchers and catchers

However batters didn't use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree
they do now  

Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing
complaints Hirschbeck was acting against expectations

Everyone was told of the new emphasis on speeding up games  The rule that
Hirschbeck invoked has been in the books a long time

  It's not as if Gant was in Hirschbeck's face 

Nobody including Hirschbeck ever said he was 


When Gant turned away Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant
to step into the box  IMO at this point in time Hirschbeck
was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game
Gant wasn't dawdling he hadn't had a chance to dawdle  And Hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play 

That's your perhaps colored by your partisanship of the Braves
perception  Hirschbeck's view was that Gant was heading off for a long
walk and in accordance with his instructions concerning speeding games up
directed him into the batter's box

 Gant resisted as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and
Hirschbeck called for the pitch

The point is based on the rulebook and the umpires' instructions it was
not an unreasonable request

The Braves were already upset

IMO any game where you remember the name of the umpire was
a bad game for the umpire

Had Gant done as instructed you wouldn't have remembered the name of the
umpire

 Hispanic magazineApril  had a couple of interesting articles about
Hispanic players including its Hispanic AllStar team 
Some of the major points are

	NPR's Morning Edition aired a report this morning  on
	HispanicLatin American players in MLB and how they have many of
	the same problems faced by blacknegroAfrican American players
	when they first entered the league  However although baseball
	has adjusted to the presence of black players many Hispanic
	players still labor under the stereotype of being fireballs
	hot blooded flashy  The report also emphasised that despite
	the rantings my word of Jessie Jackson about baseballs
	discrimination against black players in its upper echelons
	baseball has actually done much better by black players than
	Hispanic players

	Another interesting point was the language barrier problem  The
	reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he
	gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with
	the fact that there are maybe  major baseball writers that
	speak Spanish despite the fact that Spanish is one of if not
	the easiest languages to learn so easy that the author Cormac
	McCarthy learned Spanish at age  in order to research his
	book All The Pretty Horses  Yet few MLB organizations
	employ Spanish speaking personel one of the exceptions being
	the Oakland A's

	Another point

	Nearly  of Latin American players have some African blood
	Yet most report that they'd never really felt black until
	playing ball in the US

  
	Ironically enough it is the early presence of Latin American
	baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that
	baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson
	as many light black or brown Latin Americans were
	incorporated into baseball

	Cox should've protested the game the second time the garbage got
thrown at his outfielders  He should also have protested the game at the
point where Ron Gant was assessed the second strike in the ninth on the
grounds that he Cox was on the field and time should have been called

Both protests would be denied of course  The umpire's judgement
determines the garbage thing although I think the game should be
called but that's my personal opiniondoesn't matter  There
is time only when the ump says so the second argument is baseless

	The situation with the Giants' bleachers is a case in point for the
need for a commissioner

This is true but the main thing the commish ie Selig needs to do
is to suspend Bobby Cox  You cannot allow a team to come out at
the ump as the Braves did  I usually rip umps but in this case
the players were dead wrong  Cox should go for  games  If I
had ever umped a game where that happened I'd have ejected every
player that came out  Only Cox and Gant would have been spared and
then Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument

BTW by my definitions
the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team
win I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the
team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others

Well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that
Alfredo Griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs
to win while Larkin might not have that something the team needs

No  I do not find this conceivable  I also cannot conceive of the
possibility that there is any hypothetical team which Morris would
help more than Clemens

Would Griffin then be better than Larkin

Given your premise yes  But you are alone in your ability to
conceive of that premise

o any of you experts want to analyze Ron Gant
Is his early season slump because he is still swinging his bat the way
he was last year trying to hit to all fields etc or has he changed his
swing back to the old Gant and is just in a small early season slump

Is his spot int he lineup even secure especially the way he has
been hitting

I always thought that a reasonable means of measuring value between
players was to attempt to determine if a team would trade one for
another

The major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age  Even if
Morris were performing as well as Clemens right now and were likely to
this season nobody would trade Clemens for Morris straight up because
Clemens has more of his career left

Stanton  Mercker are strong and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch
The bullpen is fine probably superior

 coverreliance on Pendleton a Pendleton slump becomes a team slump
 

Also false  Gant Nixon Justice Hunter Blauser present a decent enough
offense  EVERYONE is slumping except Blauser not just Pendleton

BTW what is the story with Brian Hunter  Is he in the dog house

I need a little help from a Texas Rangers expert

I was at Yankee Stadium Sunday  Texas rout with my kids  We
wandered out to the outfield during Rangers batting practice and
I caught a ball tossed into the stands actually wrestled some guy
a bit I might add by  on the Rangers  Who is he  Looked like
a bullpen assistant type youngish I think  He was not in the
roster listed in the Yankee scorecard  Any ideas

Please email as I haven't been reading rsb regularly

Thanks

 I have wondered why a pitcher is given  pitches when he enters the
 game  Let's be serious  The relief pitcher has normally been
 throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes  Does he really need 
 more pitches

  If the relief pitcher didn't get  pitches there wouldn't be enough time
to

   Play Hit The Road Jack
   The Iron City Relief Pitcher Commercial
   The announcers to detail to us exactly what drove the

Hey Valentine I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their
fingers
Yah  So
Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his 
future
He certainly didn't earn his last one  HOW many games did he blow
in the World Series  All of the ones he started
He certainly did earn it  He was a valuable member of the Blue Jay team 

Not particularly in the World Series During the season he was probably
more valuable than say putting Olerud out there to pitch but yeah he
was valuable in getting them there In the postseason he sucked dirty
canal water through a straw The Jays won in spite of Morris much more
than because of him

Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best signing
Oh yes  Definitely  Therefore Morris is better than Clemens
Your definition of better refers to some measurement on a scale that
has nothing to do with winning WS rings

Umm Roger Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago
where the poster Valentine was replying to used  of WS rings as a measure
of better The concept is called context and you should really become
familiar with it someday

The facts are that Morris
has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning club
Clemens hasn't

Unless this transaltes to Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it

You can go on about what Clemens has done in the 
past and claim that he is better than Morris if you want to  But 
the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens
hasn't

What on earth does this mean Over their careers Clemens has won  of
the games he's started Morris  Per year Clemens has averaged nearly 
wins Morris just under  Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game If
so then consider that Clemens allows  runs innings pitched Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings In fact Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA But
I forget in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in  had Morris been on the Sox it
would have been a routine groundout right

Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement
is totally meaningless  The object of the game is not to compile 
high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important
The object of the game is to contribute to WS victories  But this
has been patiently explained to you many many times and you are 
either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it

Speaking of stupid it has been patiently and notsopatiently explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask

Don't give me that shit  If Boston had Alomar Olerud Henke and
Ward while Toronto had Rivera Jack Clark Jeff Reardon things would
have looked a little different last fall  Give credit where credit is
due  This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me sick
Yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit tooforget about what
didn't happen and open your eyes for once and look out there and
see what is REALLY happening  Forget about how Morris shouldn't
have won  with an ERA over   
When Morris pitched last year the Jays won  Stop crying about it and
get on with life

No one is crying the Jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series and I congratulate them for it As a Red Sox fan I hope they
keep Morris I was happy when they picked up Stewart and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson You see unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky Luck runs
out just like it did in  when he pitched odd more innings than 
gave up exactly one earned run more than in  and went 

Seriously Roger I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the  Morris and the  Morris Which one was a better pitcher
and why Did Morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years
If so then why did he go  in  with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than

The real way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the
following schedule of bonuses to players on both teams

   For all players who participated in the game offer  for each 
   minutes less than  hours the game took ie if the game only took 
   hours each player gets a bonus of 

   For all pitchers throwing  or more full innings in the game extrapolate
   the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have
   thrown in a full  innings and offer  for each number less than 
   If the pitcher throws a complete game with  pitches and  throws to
   first he would get 

I suspect you could finance this the same way Presidential campaigns are
paid for Offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says I want
 of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses

maynardramseycslaurentianca Roger Maynard writes
It sure does  And it all depends on the definition that you use for better
Yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really
happened

Well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened But that's OK I understand you
have a hockey background Stats like plusminus make RBI look good

Is it Viola's fault that Boston had no offense  Is it because of Morris that
the Blue Jays had such a strong offense  Don't tell me that Morris has this
magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs
This is the perfect example of your problem  You are isolating Viola's
contribution from the rest of the team's efforts  You can only do
this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without 
Viola  Only then can you compare  But you cannot know how the team
would have done without Viola  Your analysis is fallacious

OK how about a straigh answer then Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to Please
answer yes or no Roger
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs
AL only please

For anyone else following along it is a wellknown and demonstrable fact
that a team's winloss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows It's not a definite
hardandfast function but there is definitely a correlation In fact as a
rule of thumb if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs
for every  runs fewer than Y that team B allows it will win another game
So for instance if we look at the  Toronto Blue Jays we find that
they scored  runs and allowed  of which Morris allowed  All other
things being equal if Frank Viola with his  ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the  innings Morris threw plausible since Viola threw 
for Boston the Red Jays would have allowed about  fewer runs or
enough for  more wins Now that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway which is a harder park to pitch in
particularly for a lefthander than Skydome So um Roger Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis Clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a  if he had been on the Jay last year but
that is not the claim We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that had Morris
performed as Viola did his team would have been better off

It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out
here in the real world guys

This is true but not so open that your brain falls out

Yes  Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are 
finally moving in the right direction  They should finish
over  this year and maybe even be in the pennent race 
in August  However I would take back a few moves

  The Jim Abbott Trade
    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person but a
    great pitcher also  He could win the Cy Young this year 
    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield
    isn't good enough  So why was this not a good trade  
    JT Snow  How many rookies have been able to step in and
    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on 
    the Angels  I know it's early but if you've seen this kid
    hit field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be 
    a tremendous player  The Yanks should have kept him  What
    about Mattingly you ask  Well  it's great that the Yanks
    have taken care of him and remained loyal but he's  years
    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as
    before his back injury  It's a shame but as a Yankee fan 
    who wants to see the best Yankee team I'd take 
    Snow over Mattingly at first  The Yanks also gave up two
    promising propects with Snow for Abbott  Besides with
    Domingo Jean Brien taylor Wickman Militello and Sterling
    Hitchcock they are just loaded with propects  I know Abbotts
    only  but this was too much to give up  I believe George
    forced this trade because he believes and he's right that
    Abbott will be a big hit in NY  However I'd like to see the
    Yankees build a baseball team not an amusement show

  Wade Boggs
    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot  But his career is 
    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop
    a long term solution ie Hensley Muelins Russ Davis Velarde
    Besides Wade just doesn't have any range  What a shame about
    Charlie Hayes huh

  Spike Owen
    See Wade Boggs  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri
    or whoever  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is
    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA  point  And these guys
    are on the down sides of their careers

  Danny Tartabull
    Yes  he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think
    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year  But he
    never is  We should expect  games max out of him  Meanwhile
    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing
    left field  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists
    last year  and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder

What I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right
direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year  They should
at the GM level be planning for a  or  world series  This
means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they 
will be ready in a year or two  

I'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner
Certainly the Boggs deal was all George  It looks like George is
planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world
series now  The veterans are always available and can be added at any
time like Boston did this year  Develop the young players first
then add the one or two veterans or in the Yankees case just keep
them  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle
the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee
organization back into one of respect  I'm really afraid that he will
trade whoever it takes to patch holes today relief pitching for
example  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is
still one or two years away  Have patience George and we will all
enjoy the future  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball
hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time

Sam I'm not Militello or Millitello Mandelbaum

I have posted two new postings on the net since I discovered how to use it
and both times I received redicule for predicting the Red Sox as high as
Third in the AL East  Id like to hear why it is people dont think the Sox
can be as high as Third this year  Here are some of my observations

Well had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of
your predictions the responses would probably have been a bit more
measured Be that as it may

 Roger and Frank are in vintage form and the Sox are rresponding to them
Clemens is always in this form and Viola isn't really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected How do you know that the Sox are
responding to them and not to Al Bumbry Hobson or my most likely
suspect new hitting coach Mike Easler I certainly am more likely to give
Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola

 Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries
This was the optimistic scenario but not unreasonably so He hasn't shown
much power yet though

 Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him
How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership Perhaps it's
Calderon Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola Maybe Hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him Or maybe
it's all a myth And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well but not as
well as Greenwell Vaughn Cooper or Fletcher

 Russell is finishing well
In three games Why don't we look at this one again in say July

 Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter
A bit better than could reasonably have been expected But don't forget that
Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about  AB's last year Beware of
small sample sizes Still if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd
be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year Be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he doesn't have to make more than  AB or so in a year

 Cooper is hitting well I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field
and just as good at the plate
Ummmsorry no I can buy the in the field part and I think he'll be
better at the plate than the  Boggs but in general Cooper while he'll
be a pretty good hitter couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap With a little
luck he could be the fourth or fifth best B in the AL Martinez Boggs
Ventura and Palmer will all be better

If the sox Pitch like last year they have a better pitchiong staff now
and hit like they are so far they coiuld run away with thee division but
since I think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge
of running away with the division I think that they win be over  and at
least Third if not Second or First

See here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether 
is plausible third is not unlikely but phrases like could run away with
the division are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year If
Russell does well Darwin doesn't go on the DL and Hesketh doesn't pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation they could
be better On the other hand if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody Fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a
lefty and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad

In article mssCqrrzHnetcomcom mssnetcomcom Mark Singer says


 why would owners decrease ticket prices when they obviously get
   lots of people to pay the price they're asking


I don't think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing
to pay the price  I'm sure someone out there in netland has some
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity
sold  But even if the trends are relatively flat you have to consider
what is happening on a teambyteam basis

When the TV money dries up franchises will be seeking to supplant the
lost revenues from alternative sources  One of the best sources may
be ticket sales

Example 	The Dodgers

	The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales
	and probably believe that they have the ability to raise
	prices without hindering revenues  I certainly think that is
	true

Example 	The Padres

	They will be lucky to average  fans a game this year
	If they raise prices less  If they want to increase their
	overall revenue base the best thing they can do is put a
	winning team on the field  But given that won't happen it
	won't they can probably make more money by lowering ticket
	prices and running frequent promotions  Will they do that
	I have no idea  But they won't increase prices because it
	won't work for them


 even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners
   decrease ticket prices that does not decrease the tv contract


The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place
Each team's market is somewhat different and each owner is going to
be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those
market forces  As a buiness manager I would never want to lower my
prices but sometimes that strategy is necessary and sometimes it works
You have to consider everything if you want continued success

Haven't been to many A's games have you

There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm
watching them on the tube and if I'm going there in person  For me going
to an A's game has become a major commitment of time one that I'm not
willing to make that often  the length of their games is costing the A's
revenue from me

I stopped going to A's games some years ago while I still lived inthe
Bay Area for exactly this reason  I believe the length of their games
has been institutionalized by LaRussaDuncan  They encourage their
pitchers to be overly deliberate to throw to first often to study
the catchers' signals and so on  And almost every A's hitter takes
a step out of the box after every pitch  This is not imo a coincidence
This is planned  And I hate it

As for the Gant situation I did not see the game or the replays  But
I do wonder  What if Gant had requested a time out  Would Hirschbeck
have been required to give it to him  Could he have denied the requst
For all he the ump knew Gant could have had dirt in his eye

Is it just me or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield  He 
misplayed Martinez flyout into a double against the Expos misplayed

WIP is rockin with sports talk from  AM till midnight check it
out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia  If I'm not
mistaken WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation

I'm from Dallas and you have alot of nerve saying that WFAN has a bunch of

That's very true  I live in Richmond home of the AAA Richmond
Braves and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit  HR's at home
last year  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot BUT the way the
Diamond is built Home runs are a rarity   In fact Ron Gant
Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in
Richmond  When they were sent to the majors they never came back
If you can hit in Richmond you can hit anywhere  

So far after beating Scranton Phillies  in the first game the
best team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming  Too many
expectations I guess

Me too RBI are a worthless stat Of course so is stolen bases because 
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run And of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases
so batting average slugging and obp out too  Hmmm i guess homers would
not count then either
My point RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is And no stat or lack
of can tell me there are no clutch hitters Maybe no stat CAN tell me
either but some people are I just know it 

But why would you want to use RBI   RBI is an attempt to measure is some
combination of clutch hitting and power hitting  If you believe in
clutch hitting then look at how the guy hit with RISP  If you want to
see how good of a slugger he is then look at his slugging average  

In terms of evaluating players RBI totals are better than nothing  But
why use them when so many better stats are out there

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy name possibly
garbled by me an official historian for the CIA  She has won an Emmy
for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary which I know from nothing
but which sounds good  She said that among other things Berg was the 
principal spy for the OSS CIA's WWII precursor spying on Axis atomic
programs because of his physics background and language skills  She said
that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland and had 
instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb
research he concluded they were two years behind and didn't shoot him
I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb
program but I don't know how reliable this is  Unfortunately NPR didn't
mention any kind of a book she's writing  I'd certainly buy it

In case you're wondering about baseball relevance Berg was a longtime
MLB backup catcher  He was a member of an MLB AllStar team that toured
Japan in  presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because
he was one of the few Americans much less MLB players who spoke Japanese
Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids
according to McCarthy

	stuff about Ron Gant incident deleted 
 A reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season get
 the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
 length of games  I for one am glad to see this happen 

	I agree that Hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do
and also that Gant should have listened to him  However what is with this
policy of trying to speed up the games  You are the first person 
 nonmediot  I have seen endorse this policy  I have no problem with the
length of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd  and other announcers 
bitching about it  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking
at their watches and shouting Hurry up  If I cough up big bucks for a 
ticket I don't mind a game that last more than   I really don't
understand it  

	Games are longer now for several reasons  more pitching changes
more basestealing  and throws to first  etcI think a very small factor
is the increased time it takes Jose Canseco Deion Sanders insert fancy
showboat ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the
batter's box  My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this
an issue because they like shorter games  they get to head back to hotel
bar eat steaks get drunk tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase
stewardesses around the bar  Sure they want the game over with  Print 
journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games
they have deadlines  The ESPN guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy  they
constantly harp on this  primarily because they often have to work late 
when the game goes longer than 

	Maybe I am just a ne'erdowell with nothing better to do but I 
would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you

	As a parenthetical note it seems the league is in any case fighting
a losing battle this year  The increased offense thus far will certainly 
spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly

And finally I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them than because they have a great eye

This comes up periodically and I just don't get it Take for example Mark
McGwire He walked  times in  If that's not a potential great example
of what you're talking about then I don't know what is Now let's look at
what happens when McGwire doesn't walk
   of the time he made an out
   of the time he hit a single
   of the time he hit a double
   of the time he hit a homer
Now you're pitching against McGwire Would you trade  walks for  homers
 double  singles and  outs I would Why give him the base when you
can get him out  times out of 
Then there are guys like Alex Cole who has a career  OBP even
though he's never had a batting average over  he did hit  in
 AB in  or hit a single home run Yep that's right he's
never hit a homer in  AB's through the end of  Who'd be
afraid to throw a strike to him

Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average
stats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated runvalue of defensive
performances compared to league average  I've combined those with my
positionadjusted MLV numbers to come up with firstapproximation total
run values for players last year  We can use these as a springboard for
reconsideration of the MVP award

Major caveats  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment so if
San Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the
infield that will cause some inaccuracies  The offensive numbers are
positionadjusted but not park adjusted so we have to deflate some and
inflate others to be fair  Finally we still don't know what to do about
catchers and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions 
of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts  

Having said that there are still some surprises  Let's look National
League first  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season

	Player		Offense		Defense		Total

	Sandberg	  		  		 
	Bonds		  		   		 
	Walker		  		  		 
	Justice		  		  		 
	Daulton	 	  		  		 
	Larkin		  		   		 
	Grace		  		  		 

As I see it these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season
If you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley you
get essentially a dead heat  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self it
wouldn't have been close but that apparently wasn't the case  Darren
Daulton needs  or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference
and I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible  A good case 
could be made for any of Sandberg Bonds or Daulton as top dude

My personal vote  Bonds Sandberg Daulton Walker Justice


In the American League

	Player		Offense		Defense		Total

	Ventura		  		  		 
	Martinez	  		  		 
	B Anderson 	  		  		 
	Thomas		  		  		 
	R Henderson	  		  		 
	Raines		  		  		 
	Tettleton	  		  		 

OK let's see a show of hands how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top
player in the AL last year  I certainly didn't but I'd have a hard time
arguing against him at this point  Yes I know these numbers are only
approximate but that's a big gap between him and the  guy  Also those
of you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds

Once again there's a catcher in the ointment  If calling a game is as
important as it might be  runs is easy to make up or give away  TAke
a guess folks I don't think we can do any better than that

My personal vote excluding pitchers

	Ventura Tettleton Anderson Martinez Henderson

I'm a big Frank Thomas fan but I have to admit to a bias in favor of
balanced offensivedefensive contribution which should have a higher
leverage in WL record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with
negative defense

For the record

	Carlos Baerga		  		  		  
	Roberto Alomar		  		 		  

Forget it it's a wash

Let me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding
Don Mattingly's defense this past season  Don recovered brilliantly from his
weak ' and ' to end up with

	Mattingly		  		  		   runs

which is clearly an aboveaverage first baseman  However it's still  runs
behind Mark McGwire  runs behind Frank Thomas and  runs behind John
Olerud  On the other hand it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro Cecil Fielder and
every other AL first baseman not yet mentioned

To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism I am having a 
contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current 
heights  You must decide first whether the Sox will be at  again
at any time during this year  Then you must predict either

 Their record the first time they're at  if they are or

 Their final record if they stay above  the rest of the year

So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as  resend it if you 
were serious Val

ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was
in  when they finished  in sixth place

So email me your guess either at barringcswashingtonedu or directly
replying to this post

However what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games
You are the first person  nonmediot  I have seen endorse this policy
I have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the
ESPN crowd  and other announcers  bitching about it  I have never
been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and
shouting Hurry up  If I cough up big bucks for a ticket I don't mind
a game that last more than   I really don't understand it

I agree with Nick  What's the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball there's that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

First a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball  The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches

And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this
is only true when they don't become extralong  Quicklypitched games
can grab and hold your attention much better

Bring back the twohour baseball game  And the three and a half hour
golf game with it

A HBP but it reminds of my favorite apochryphal  sp  Don Drysdale story

When ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hotdogged on him in
two previous atbats Drysdale reared back with the first pitch and
drilled him right in the ribs

His manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled What did you do that

Drysdale growled back What are you complaining for  I saved you three
pitches

 Before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the Jays
 have won the AL with a good pitcher from AAA in place of Morris given
 his run support  How about an average ML pitcher  I can't believe
 that Morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive
 impact on the Jays performance 

I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris but let's give credit
where credit is due

It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris
Last year when the team went  for the month of August and all the 
other starters were being shelled and Milwaukee was making a charge
Morris went  with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly
Also let's not underestimate the importance his  innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day  If he didn't help us win the AL east forget
about the pennent and the world series

His run support was high  runs but so was Stottlemyer's  runs
and he won only  games  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of
 and  ballgames but this is to his credit  He pitched only as good
as he needed to be  When he was up  in a ballgame he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
I hate this expression  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  But Morris being a 
veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball  By saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra
I hate this too when the game was on the line

Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year but let's not change history
to suit the present  

BTW I think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a 
veteran pitcher which Cito would never do but his era is  how much more
can he be embarrassed

 
 From where I sit I'll let others have the excellent players  I'll
 settle for good enough and the ring 

ditto

Give Jackson a breakhe lost about  pounds with that flu he had

DJ was a popular player in San Diego Derek Bell was not faring well in the
clubhouse at Toronto so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it
was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry
No statistic can describe it sorry statheads and since there are so many
new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it

Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v Clemens WS Ring string

Yet at first I was sad to see Derek go still anticipating all of the talent
they raved about at the beginning of last season  I'm glad to see him
faring well for the Padres though

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy name possibly
garbled by me an official historian for the CIA  She has won an Emmy
for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary which I know from nothing
but which sounds good  She said that among other things Berg was the 
principal spy for the OSS CIA's WWII precursor spying on Axis atomic
programs because of his physics background and language skills  She said
that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland and had 
instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb
research he concluded they were two years behind and didn't shoot him
I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb
program but I don't know how reliable this is  Unfortunately NPR didn't
mention any kind of a book she's writing  I'd certainly buy it
Dave MB

There is a great book out called They Also Served which is about the 
ballplayers during WWII  There is some info on Berg in there  It also has 
info on Pete Gray one armed outfielder and other players of the era  Because
of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the
draft for medical reasons  There are some very interesting stories in the
book It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an 
interest in baseball

 You want to speed up ballgames
  
   Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches the current
     rule is too lenient and then enforce it  Fifteen seconds is more
     than enough time  If the pitch isn't released in  call it a ball
     and restart the clock
 
I remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work  I don't remember
why they said that it did not work  Anyone remember this

Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil has been saying that a pitch clock was
inevitable  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first

Another pair of suggestions
 Remove the Balk rule  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
   no matter what the pitcher does

 If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time X   to 
   without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base
   as if walked

The nobalk seems to give the pitcher the advantage  The basewalk allows
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base

 Baseball games take about  in the NL and just a shade under  hours

This is the fifth request to find out about a Cardinals mailing list
It looks like one does not exist  If anyone has the initiative 
creating a list might be a worthwhile activity

  Some comments deleted for bandwidth God knows we need it 

 
Baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents It is
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success
or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most
cases Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe
Carter Robby Alomar Tom Henke Juan Guzman John Olerud et al
Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as
Herm Winninham Luis Rivera and Jeff Reardon To define the quality
of the team as a sum of its components as I do albeit imperfectly
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the
mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you
do
 
 No I am not trying to define the quality of an individual at least not
 for the purpose of ranking them  Toronto won with Olerud  They might
 have won with Fielder  They might not have won with Thomas  Detroit
 might have won with Thomas  Chicago might have won with Fielder  You
 can't rank these individuals  You can only look at who might contribute
 more to the team effort which is winning the WS  Thomas could not
 have contributed to that goal any more than Olerud so I cannot say that
 Olerud is less of a player 
  
  
  Ok Roger here's a question for you  Say you are running an expansion
team  You don't HAVE a team at the moment but the draft is coming up  Who
are you going to pick guys who have won the most WS rings or guys who 
COULD contribute the most to your team  Say the Reds were dumb enough to 
not protect Larkin and the Jays didn't protect Alfredo  Who would you
pick

    I can't believe I'm getting involved in this

Oh great  We fans can subsidize the cost of speeding up the games

not want to provide a list of players and get back nice printed reports

For an expansion team  I'm pretty sure I would go with the rings as long
as their salaries and ages weren't too high  I would want the fans to be 
able to identify the players  I would like a championship attitude in the 
clubhouse

As for Larkin and Griffin  Salaries aside I would have to consider which
player is likeliest to contribute to a WS victory  Past performance age and
attitude would all be integral to my decision  I certainly wouldn't just
haul out my copy of Gillete and pick Larkin as many others would  And
unlike many others who post to this group I hardly consider myself quali
fied to make those kinds of decisions

    I can't believe I'm getting involved in this

DJ was a popular player in San Diego Derek Bell was not faring well in the

No statistic can describe it sorry statheads and since there are so many
new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it

Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v Clemens WS Ring string

  I laugh at you now and I will laugh at you again equally publicly
when the Jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent

  Since time immemorial batters have complained about calls
So have pitchers and catchers
 
 However batters didn't use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree
 they do now  

  I really think that this is the key point  When I saw the incident on
Baseball Tonight Sunday I couldn't believe how far away from the plate
Gant went  Then he casually leaned against his bat  I don't blame the 
umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch

  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the
field  What were they going to do attack the umpire  The only people
who should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches but NO players
I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for
having no control over his team

that HE'D been thrown out  And Gant had a legitimate beef about
the  pitch that was called a strike  A reasonable umpire would
not have tried to FORCE Gant back into the box in that situation

A reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games  I for one am glad to see this happen and hope more
umpires will do as Hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if
the batter won't get back in the box  

While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around
Gant wasn't ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back immediately
As soon as he stepped out Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box
Now Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches  The only reason
he did then because he was very bothered by the call  I expect his
concentration wasn't there yet and in a crucial situation I imagine it's
best to be as calm as possible  Contributing factors would be Gant's
bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the Braves long scoring
drought

Now it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is
telling you to get in there  You know the umpire is going to do something
call for a strike throw you out etc  Gant was wrong

But Hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased view  Aside from the major chip
he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the problem  Gant had a reason
to want some time disputed strike call  Gant hadn't been wasting time all
game  The game had been cruising along and was just over two hours old
The score was  with  outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position
Is there any reason Hirschbeck couldn't and shouldn't cut Gant a little
slack  For no discernible constructive reason Hirschbeck disrupted the
game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key
situation  Did he have a date to get to

And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game

I plan on being in the Toronto area sometime this summer late June or
early July and would like to attend a Blue Jay game  I would
appreciate if anyone could give me information on how to obtain
tickets for Blue Jay games  I would prefer to get good seats and I
assume this would require going through some ticket broker and paying
  Ticket broker info for the Toronto area andor ticket info
directly through the Blue Jays would be appreciated I'll bring oxygen
if need be  My schedule is flexible so any games are candidates
though I'd prefer to see Texas

Thanks in advance

	The reason I bothered doing this DR stuff was to see if I could
determine the answer to the ageold question Is Jeff Blauser more
valuable than Rafael Belliard

Well it looks like just as Doug trumped Tim beating him to the net
with his defensive analyses so Tim has gotten in ahead of me

The way I was doing it was a little different Being me of course I
used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth
and I calculated both rate of performance fielding equivalent
average and total performance fielding equivalent runs But I
compared not to the average player but the replacement player and
here's why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the
system In the AL of  the average SS is  runs above
replacement RAR cf  B  B  LF  RF 
B  We may quibble with the exact numbers but the order looks
substantially right

In the equivalent average I have always set league average to  I
had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of
 the name of that replacement level hitter often as not is
Billy Ripken I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the
same distance from  as  but in the opposite direction as I
have set it up that makes for an eqa of  Yes I can add Runs
are proportional to eqa squared the difference between  squared
and  squared equals the difference to  squared and I rounded
off for simplicity An allreplacement fielding team would have
Randy Milligan at first  Willie Randolph  at second Leo
Gomez  at third Walt Weiss  at short Kevin Bass 
in left HoJo  in center and Eric Anthony  in right Ugh

So the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and
fielding RAR I can rate them by total RAR or RAR per some number of
batting outs like  An average player has a total RAR of about 
 batting  fielding

And finally I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them than because they have a great eye

This comes up periodically and I just don't get it Take for example Mark
McGwire He walked  times in  If that's not a potential great example
of what you're talking about then I don't know what is Now let's look at
what happens when McGwire doesn't walk
   of the time he made an out
   of the time he hit a single
   of the time he hit a double
   of the time he hit a homer
Now you're pitching against McGwire Would you trade  walks for  homers
 double  singles and  outs I would Why give him the base when you
can get him out  times out of 

I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like
McGwire Bonds and Frank Thomas was rational  
I just said that it exists

Then there are guys like Alex Cole who has a career  OBP even
though he's never had a batting average over  he did hit  in
 AB in  or hit a single home run Yep that's right he's
never hit a homer in  AB's through the end of  Who'd be
afraid to throw a strike to him

I don't know Alex Cole's batting style at all   Some questions
How tall is he
Does he go into a crouch like Rickey HedersonPete Rose
Does he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler
Does he take  or  strikes in each at bat

It could be the Cole has a good batting eye
Look above I said that many high OBP guys draw their walks because
pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them not all high OBP guys

   I'm sure many people woulds like to know so why not just post it to the net

kubeysgicom Ken Kubey said

And finally I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them than because they have a great eye

I'm not sure  I used to think this was true but more and more I'm becoming
convinced that it's the other way around among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot

Let's break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot


			Power			No Power

	Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler
			Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith
			Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck
			Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins
			Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton
			Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost
			Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove
			   			   
			   			   
			   			   

	Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen
			Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston
			Joe Carter		Andres Thomas
			George Bell		Jose Lind
			Kirby Puckett		Devon White

Okay I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a
strike or two and try to get on base any way they can

So the No PowerImpatient guys have no excuse
The No PowerPatient guys are doing the right thing

Now the ImpatientPower guys how could you leave out the Big Cat
Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took
more pitches   Perhaps but I doubt it  If you tell Joe Carter
to go up there and take a few pitches he will draw more walks but
he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because
he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive

The PatientPower guys   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and
Rickey Henderson has a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart 
so they get their walks based on the small zone

Look at the other  guys Thomas Bonds McGwire Ruth and Williams  Wow
A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe
walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them
The pitchers would do better in my opinion by just coming after
them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch but pitchers
would rather nibble go  or  and then get hurt

        If I were the manager I'd argue that the runner was out of
        the base line since he was to the left of the first base
        line  If the umps don't budge which they won't  they nev
        er admit when they are wrong I'd file a protest with the
        league

Rule k states It is interference by a batter or runner when 
in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base
 he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of
the foul line and in the umpire's judgment interferes with the field
er taking the throw at first base

The key word in the rule is and A runner isn't out just for running
out of the baseline He's out for interfering with the fielding of the
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first Because the catcher
opted to throw the ball over the batterrunner's head there's no inter
ference



So what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw

The rule book certainly doesn't have a definiton or clarification so it's
possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter
his throw to avoid hitting the batterrunner then again we have interference
You know it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justlyif the
catcher or the pitcher say Rob Dibble for example throws toward first
and hits the runner running inside the baseline the fielder takes the chance
of being ejected  Therefore he probably would throw around the runner or
your scenario above him

You should note that in our American Legion League which uses MLB rules we
interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there IS interference
per rule

Umpires are not required to call time out just because a player
asks for time Only in extreme cases like dust in the pitcher's
or hitter's eyes should an umpire call time

The batter has  seconds to get situated in the box and receive
a pitch I'm against putting a giant clock or any size clock
for that matter up to count down  seconds between pitches and
the minute for warmups But I think umpires should tell hitters
to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and
instruct the pitcher to pitch The same goes for pitchers Umps
should tell them to pitch or feint within  seconds or a ball
will be called That's the way it should be

attempt to avoid getting hit the batter is awarded first for a
base on balls If the umpire rules he did try to get out of the

 Before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the Jays
 have won the AL with a good pitcher from AAA in place of Morris given
 his run support  How about an average ML pitcher  I can't believe
 that Morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive
 impact on the Jays performance 
I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris but let's give credit
where credit is due
It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris
Last year when the team went  for the month of August and all the 
other starters were being shelled and Milwaukee was making a charge
Morris went  with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly
Also let's not underestimate the importance his  innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day  If he didn't help us win the AL east forget
about the pennent and the world series

A guy who threw  innings with about  run lower ERA would have saved the
bullpen even more Say somebody like Frank Viola  innings

His run support was high  runs but so was Stottlemyer's  runs
and he won only  games  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of
 and  ballgames but this is to his credit  He pitched only as good
as he needed to be  When he was up  in a ballgame he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
I hate this expression  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  But Morris being a 
veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball  By saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra
I hate this too when the game was on the line

Nice audition tape Send it to
   Baseball Tonight
   ATTN Ray Knight
   ESPN
   Bristol CT

Have you by chance taken a look at the boxscores from last year to
determine the accuracy of your account I seem to recall Morris getting at
least  or  wins last year when the Jays came back from behind after they
had decided to pull Morris at the end of an inning

 Hi there
 
 I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now
 There are many problems occuring for me One of them is the ERA statistic for
 pitchers What does it say 

ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per
nine inning game  Thus if a pitcher pitched  innings and gave up  earned
run his  inning equivelent perfomance would be  earned runs thus his ERA
is   To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 

	ERA  ERIP  

An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed
to a fielding error  More specifically if an error occurs that represented
the third out all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs
Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base
when the pitcher exited the game  Here are some examples

	If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  If
	an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after
	this error and NOT counted as earned runs

	If a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game
	before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who
	were left on base  If the those runners who were left on base score
	and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are
	attributed to the pitcher who left the game

I hope this explains things for you

					Joe

 You want to speed up ballgames
  
   Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches the current
                                                                      
     rule is too lenient and then enforce it  Fifteen seconds is more
        
Please pardon my ignorance if this is well known but what is the current 
rule 

     than enough time  If the pitch isn't released in  call it a ball
     and restart the clock
 
I remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work  I don't remember
why they said that it did not work  Anyone remember this

Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil has been saying that a pitch clock was
inevitable  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first

Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make
and award a balk if he exceeds it  I'd have another question  who would 
operate the pitch clock  One of the umpires  Add another one to the crew

Another pair of suggestions
 Remove the Balk rule  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
   no matter what the pitcher does

I'm not sure I like this idea  I think it would severely diminish the 
number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic
ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play one of my personal favorites

 If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time X   to 
   without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base
   as if walked

Ahhh  I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the 'f' key
eh  Obviously from what I wrote above I like this idea

The nobalk seems to give the pitcher the advantage  The basewalk allows
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base

It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag since the 
pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner
so he may hurry too much  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of 
sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness
that could result from this kind of rule  So I suppose there are some
disadvantages to that idea too

 Baseball games take about  in the NL and just a shade under  hours
 in the AL  That's just too damn long  I don't like to PLAY in  hour
 games much less WATCH a game for that long  My butt falls asleep and
 if I'm watching on TV I'll channel surf between pitches catching
 colorized versions of Mr Ed Leave it to Beaver and Those Wacky
 Nieporents on Nick at Nite

I too find myself surfing when I know that it will be enough time between
each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery

I remember in little league if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's
box even for a moment we were automatically out  That may be a little 
harsh for the majors but seriously how about putting a limit on the 
batters being able to step out take several dozen practice swings pound
their shoes scratch their balls etc  Maybe forcing them to stay in the
batter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea  That could save a few minutes

While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around
Gant wasn't ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back immediately
As soon as he stepped out Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box
Now Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches  The only reason
he did then because he was very bothered by the call  I expect his
concentration wasn't there yet and in a crucial situation I imagine it's
best to be as calm as possible  Contributing factors would be Gant's
bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the Braves long scoring
drought

And it is not Hirschbeck's job to help Gant with any of these difficulties
If Gant can't gather his concentration for whatever reason that just makes
him all the more meat in the batter's box  The umpire's job is to 
maintain flow of play  Gant is not entitled to time to regather his
faculties

Nor is anyone else

Now it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is
telling you to get in there  You know the umpire is going to do something
call for a strike throw you out etc  Gant was wrong

Absolutely  I think it'd be more accurate to say Gant was foolish

But Hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased view  Aside from the major chip
he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the problem  Gant had a reason
to want some time disputed strike call  

If a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout games would last
about ninefifteen weeks if Jack Morris or Dave Whiner Stieb were
pitching  A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out
Suck it up get back in the box and never badmouth the blue  They're
not going to change their mind and you're just going to come across
as a pinhead which won't help you with the borderline calls

FTR  I never speak to umpires when I don't know them personally nor
do I glance at them or react to calls  As a result I think I get more
than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate because I have a
rep of having a good eye  Actually there are a lot of negative
connotations that go with that rep including copious questions about
my masculinity party affiliation and sexual preference

Gant hadn't been wasting time all
game  The game had been cruising along and was just over two hours old

Irrelevant  He was wasting time THEN

The score was  with  outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position
Is there any reason Hirschbeck couldn't and shouldn't cut Gant a little
slack  

  Because it's not his job

  Because setting the precedent of cutting slack THERE can easily 
    extend to those  hour games  Kind of like the phantom DP

For no discernible constructive reason Hirschbeck disrupted the
game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key
situation  Did he have a date to get to

Gant hurt himself and the Braves disrupted the game  Your biases are
exposed and I'm sitting here defending umpires and the SF Giants
which is like Phyllis Schlafly defending Gary Segura Jack Kevorkian
and the Swedish Abortion Team  

And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game

I believe Terry said the magic word  There are some truly quick ways
to get tossed from a ballgame  For a primer email me

Of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that Galarraga's

Alright that's enough I've suffered with all kinds of insults as
typical for the net but give me a break Galarraga is currently
batting over  and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing
enough walks  What would he have to do to please you guys bat 
You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen
THEN I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches My comment
that he isn't paid to walk doesn't mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it's more along the lines of he's
batting  and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference
does it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks Sheesh

Don't you GUYS think so  I mean c'mon  What the heck are women doing
even THINKING of getting into baseball
Oh I don't know  Maybe because they love the game
 
 
  They cause so many problems  Just
look at Lisa Olson  Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New
England Patriots locker room  She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL
So people deal with unfair treatment differently  I suppose you would have
more respect if she punched out some people like a stereotypical macho
man would have done
  I
just don't think women belong in a man's sport  Before you smart guys
flame me for this I know the given example was about football  Who cares
 It still applies to other MALE sports
MALE sports are only that way because they won't let women be involved  There
is no Divine Providence segregating sports  It is the decision of the men
who run it  Men almost as liberal thinking as you
 
   How can we have women umpires
UmmmBy insisting they  pass an Accredited Umpire course then hiring them
 
Jeez  Look at Pam Postema  Just because she's a woman everybody on the
face of the earth thinks it's great that she's getting an opportunity to
ump  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of
roast beef you'd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires
Besides she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a
foul tip off of Wade Boggs' bat Or Jose Oquendo's bat
Listen Mr Status Quo I know Pam Postema  I've seen her work  She is without
question the toughest person I've ever met  She doesn't give a damn about
her fingernails but does care about working the game  She's not there to find
a man to take care of her but to do the best job ANY umpire can do  Your
bullshit comments are obviously tailored to show off the red on you  neck not
your grasp on society


There's nothing wrong with a red neck  Why some of us hicks even
listen to cultured music and such can you say the same  Aside from
that you shouldn't try to shit on this guy by insulting where YOU
think he comes from  Where I'm from we milk cows drive trucks and
yes even like baseball  So screw anyone that doesn't like it

Oh yeah learn the difference between to and too cityboy see below

	 unnumbered wannabe member of the Bob Knepper Fan Club BKFC


 
  Either way there
are too many complications
Nobody said life was easy  Pam is aware of that  To bad that she has to be
judged by people like you who can't look past anatomy

 Does anybody know what is going on with Lankford I know he was
 out for a few games with a slight injury but since he has
 beenback and before the injury for that matter he has been
 really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths

His performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury
received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series
It may also be him pressing a little

As for the baserunning it does not appear to be just Lankford
Dent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game
against Cincy  but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger's catcher

 
 Whereis the Ray Lankford we saw last year

Good question  At least it doesn't appear that we are seeing the

A comment made by one of the Braves announcers attributed to
an anonymous player after Friday night's game

	I'm sorry we didn't tie it up I wanted to see some more
	 umpiring

Just about sums it up

Sure like Ron Gant wasn't completely out of line

If I were Hirschbeck I would have ejected in order Ron Gant every single
last Brave who came onto the field and possibly Bobby Cox depending on the
language he used  Since Cox was the only Brave rung up I suspect I would
have thrown him out too

You simply cannot show up an umpire like Ron Gant did  It is disrespectful
of not only the home plate umpire but of the dignity of the game

When Gant turned away Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant
to step into the box  IMO at this point in time Hirschbeck
was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game
Gant wasn't dawdling he hadn't had a chance to dawdle  And Hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play  Gant resisted as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and
Hirschbeck called for the pitch  At that point Cox came out on
the field the pitch was thrown and many other Braves left the
dugout  Cox was tossed protecting his player  I was pleasantly
surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game

Did you see the same game I saw Gant most reasonable argued a
horrible call which Hirschbeck correctly did nothing about Gant
then proceeded to walk halfway to rd base lean on his bat and
glare at Hirschbeck While I don't necessasarily subscribe to the
theory of showing people up this was an obvious attempt by Gant to
do so to Hirschbeck He left Hirschbeck no choice but to take control
of the situation The bottom line is Gant started a dangerous
power struggle with Hirschbeck when his team needed him most and
he lost

The events I saw were
  Called strike by Hirschbeck
  Shockedlooking Gant asks for appeal to first
  No appeal to first
  Gant steps out of batters box
  Hirschbeck immediately orders Gant back in  bad move
  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off bad move
  Hirschbeck yells at Gant  Gant is silent
  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch
  Pitch is called a strike
  Cox argues couldn't see when he came on the field
  Cox is ejected players everywhere
  Play finally resumes

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out the
whole incident probably would have been avoided

I agree with Nick  What's the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball there's that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

First a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball  The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches


Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football
Last year I hardly watched a game  What turned me off were the
incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game  A team scores
 minutes of commercials  Kickoff   minutes of commercials
Three downs and a punt   minutes of commercials  AAAAARRRRGH

Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's whom I
believe institutionalize slow play  I don't mind the catandmouse
game with Rickey on first  in fact I rather enjoy it  Similarly
I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first  What
I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first
or when the game is a blowout  I don't mind when the pitcher steps off 
the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation or when a hitter
steps out of the box to regain his concentration  What I object to
is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity
When a game is exciting these little delays serve as tension builders
and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game  When the
delays happen with regularity they become nuisances just like the
commercial breaks in football  

I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to speed up
the games basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move
the markers and the ball to the spots faster  That did not address
the problem of the continuity of the game  It may have appeased the
sponsors and the networks but I would be amazed if it did anything
to enhance the experience of the fans

Similary while some hour baseball games bore me to tears those are the
ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly
long periods to get ready for each pitch  I doubt if anyone watching
the BravesGiants game cared about Gant stepping out  I doubt if anyone
watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an
opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that
was present  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would
eliminate that aspect of baseball

On the other hand I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful
enough to sit down with AldersonLaRussaDuncan and explain that they
are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games 
out the way that they do  I sure wouldn't mind a little armtwisting
there

Out of curiousity why haven't you pointed this same thing out to Mr

against Will Clark As for taking the word of those two Leonard has
repeatedly said he had no problems with Will and Mitchell refused to
comment

Mike you again prove your utter inability to read plain english

It is ironic that in any post that criticizes langauge ability the critic
invariably makes a mistake himself english is generally written English

Find somebody who is literate and have them explain my full post
to you

I am not saying Will Clark is a racist
I am not saying Will Clark is not a racist
I am saying that I do not know and you do not know
I am saying that I do not care and consider it the Giants' concern

Oddly I do not see that I have contested any of that Perhaps you with 
assuredly greater english ability can explain in tiny words that I might
grasp their meaning precisely WHERE I infer that you have said any of those
things 

David Nieporent understood my post and replied in private email  You
should perhaps take reading lessons from him

No Mr Fisher you should place the burden of proof on the one who makes the
allegation in the first place You do not Perhaps you might explain why that
is As for the email route Mr Fisher you might have tried that yourself

In my computerized baseball game I keep track of a category called
stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not
make with average effort  Using the  Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols Thanks Sherri I've figured out some defensive stats
for the centerfielders Hits Stolen have been redefined as Plays Juan
Gonzalez would not have made

OK I realize that's unfair  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff
fluke shots and a monster park factor  But let's put it this way  If we
replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's  out
making ability how many extra hits would go by

To try and correlate it to reality a little more I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra 
Bases doubles and triples let by

Finally I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution or
DCON   Basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS Defense  Onbase Plus Slug which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team  So don't
take it too seriously  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article

More discussion 

DCON formula  NHS  NDPPA  NHS  NDP  NEBAB
Why such a bizzare formula  Basically it's designed to be added into the
OPS with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored
The extra outs are factored into OBP while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors

DCON formula  NHS  NDPPA  NHS  NDP  NEBAB
Why such a bizzare formula  Basically it's designed to be added into the
OPS with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored
The extra outs are factored into OBP while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors

  Wade Boggs
    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot  But his career is 
    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop
    a long term solution ie Hensley Muelins Russ Davis Velarde
    Besides Wade just doesn't have any range  What a shame about
    Charlie Hayes huh

Actually according to the DA information posted by Sherri Boggs is superior
defensively to have  Here's their Defensive Averages for the last five
years compared to average at b AL

                                            
Boggs                  
Hayes                   

If Hayes is a defensive standout at third he's done a good job in disguising
it  To put it another way compared to an average third baseman last year

Boggs converted  more grounders into outs turned  more double plays and
prevented  doubles

Hayes let  more grounders go by for hits turned  more double plays and
prevented  doubles

It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris
Last year when the team went  for the month of August and all the 
other starters were being shelled and Milwaukee was making a charge
Morris went  with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly
Also let's not underestimate the importance his  innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day  If he didn't help us win the AL east forget
about the pennent and the world series

His run support was high  runs but so was Stottlemyer's  runs
and he won only  games  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of
 and  ballgames but this is to his credit  He pitched only as good
as he needed to be  When he was up  in a ballgame he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
I hate this expression  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  But Morris being a 
veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball  By saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra
I hate this too when the game was on the line

I don't buy this at all  I think things are colored to a very large
degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are  Try
this exercise

XXX is pitching today  His team scores  in the first inning and 
in the fourth  XXX gives up  in the st through th  In the fifth
he gives up  runs  In the th he gives up  more  The score is now
 with XXX's team still on top

I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris the assessment would be he is
a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win

If XXX were Mike Trmbley the assessment would be he is an
inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch  Needs more
seasoning  Send him to AAA  Or to the spice rack

I don't think it was that obvious at the time that Viola was better
Morris and Viola had comparable KIP ratios in   Viola was coming
off an injury whereas Morris was healthy

At the time I didn't really want the Sox to sign either  I was more
than a little worried about Viola's elbow

But you surely remember my shout of relief when after a week of
rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox they ended up with Viola
instead

Now I'm even happier  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely

Also Morris was willing to sign for only two years
The Jays don't like to sign pitchers to longterm contracts which I think
is a sensible policy

How long did Viola sign for  Three years  I generally agree with
their policy of avoiding longterm contracts for pitchers  But I
think they enforce it rather too strictly  These days the premier
pitchers all sign three or four year deals  Which leaves the Jays
with Morris and Stewart  If the Jays want to compete for top free
agent pitchers they will have to accept greater risks

Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris  Are there any
automatic activation clauses  What is the buyout amountf

too difficult but a bit challenging nevertheless

Mail me your answers please or post them


  Which pitcher played for the Harlem Globetrotters

  Which major leaguer briefly tried professional golf in 

  Which does Dieon Sanders have more of professionally
    career touchdowns or triples

  Has there been any player of both pro hockey and baseball
    If so name him and the years he played each

   Another pair of suggestions
    Remove the Balk rule  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
      no matter what the pitcher does

    If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time X   to 
      without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base
      as if walked

This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably  Suppose the pitcher uses up N of his N pickoff
attempts  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time

Would this suggestion apply to pickoff attempts per pitch per
batter or per base runner on the same base

Alright that's enough I've suffered with all kinds of insults as
typical for the net but give me a break Galarraga is currently
batting over  and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing
enough walks  What would he have to do to please you guys bat 
You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team

Fine are you willing to bet that he will bat  the rest of the way

The point is that he has hurt the Rockies so far it's that he will hurt
them eventually  Just as much as he hurt the Expos and the Cardinals the
past couple seasons

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen
THEN I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches My comment

It has happened for the past  seasons where have you been

that he isn't paid to walk doesn't mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it's more along the lines of he's
batting  and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference
does it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks Sheesh

We'll see come September  I have an outstanding bet with someone that
Galarraga's OBP will be less than  on June

The Red Sox usually have  catchers  I don't think they have a backup now
but they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder  You don't need a good rd catcher just a
competent one so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field

Actually I'm not sure that Philly won but they were ahead  in the bottom

of the eighth I was going to post the box score but since Cinci was playing
so criminally bad the pub I was at had to turn the game off

So here's what's up

Cincinnati had seven hits all singles by the end of the eighth  This makes
it six games with exactly ONE extra base hit

Cincinnati was  with runners in scoring position
Now if a team is going to be completely without power they absolutely
HAVE to hit in clutch situations

Cincinnati starter Tom Browning pitched  innings giving up  runs and  h
its
while striking out   He was surely the loser tonight
Reds starters while supposedly solid have won only one game this year
Of course the Reds have only won two

Cleanup batter Sabo went   Besides yesterday's homer he's SUCKED at the
plate

Dibble may not actually return Friday This may not mean anything since Cinci
may
not find themselves in a save situation for a while

Speaking of which The Reds have ha exactly one lead this week for oneand
ahalf innings after Chris' dinger on Tuesday

Manager Tony Perez says the Reds are just not swinging the bat well right now
Good call Doggie

Well there's a big difference between just not swinging the bat well and
what the Reds are doing at the plateUUUGGGHHHH

    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment
of WFAN and WIPI go to school in Philadelphia and I listen to
both stations on a consistant basis  Now that the fan has Mike
Lupica on from  to noon they have a person who can get the 
big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance
He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show but he 
had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too  
  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent
Morning show
  In my opinion I think Imus is much better than Bruno Cataldi 
and Morganti even though I would feel different if Morganti
had a better crew of people to work with  To me WIP tries
to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme  In terms of
sports Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he
interjects humor and politics into his show
 AM to  Noon
  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their
abilities to host a radio show but I think Chuck has the
advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller
who is asking about who the local team is going to draft
in the sixth round  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get
better interview guests but I heard the PD of WIP say that
they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless
it was a major story
  I would consider this even because they are two different
styles of host

 Noon to  PM
  At this point I would have to give a big advantage to 
Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been
on for a couple of weeks  I just think JM has the ability
to transcend the homer mentality of the Philadelphia fan
base  This is most evident when the IGGLESPhiladelphia 
spelling play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan
Where else can you have people call up and predict a 
score without the egging of the hostsreWIP morning 'guys'
I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight
and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating
hosts  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on 
either station by a good margin  If you are in NY and
you can't get WIP JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes

PM to PM
  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and 
Russofatso and froot loops and I become the most divided
in my loyalties  Mike and the dog are very entertaining
but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 
to  minutes without talking about sports  MATD do
get great guests and that is the basis for their show so
it is like the  to  debate  Another plus is the
appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning which
are often hilarious  

 PM to  PM
  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli  I like
Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks  
I know that SF came from Philly originally but when he
was at the FAN he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly
homer now  I don't listen to WIP much after  PM unless there
is a game on that night but you will see later for the 
reason  That is why I give the advantage to FAN

 PM to Midnight
  SM are on WIP until  and then it is the man who makes
Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on
charges of racism G Cobb  This man is so grating on my
nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go
nutsI know that is biased but listen to his show
On FAN there is usually a game on Knicks Rangers Mets
Jets or St John's basketball  If the game is on the
west coast then it is usually Howie Rose  Of course
I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP but
WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season
If this is the sports station why did they lose the
IGGLES to WYSPhome of Howard Stern in Phil
During the summer it
is all talk on WIP


Overall I would have to give the advantage to WFAN with
the exception of  to  and  to  where it is even and
 to  where WIP has the advantage

ObBase  Apparently the new owner Drayton McLain sp doesn't particularly
like excuses  An item in our paper the Austin AmericanStatesman  If you
read it here it was somewhere else first said that he wouldn't take 
injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been
accounted for  Uh oh  I don't want an owner that'll keep everybody on
edge  I'd never gotten that feeling about him but who knows  Does 
anybody down there in the Houston area have a feel for how meddling of an
owner McLain is going to be

I Love it how all of these people are blaming the Phillies success 
on a weak division  Why don't we look at the record of the teams in

is really kicking the shit out of the West  I know it is early but 
that is all we have to go on  Atlanta is just so strong with their 
 BA Cincinnati is  coming off a sweep at Veteran's Stadium in 
Philadelphia and Houston was swept in it's first three games by the 
Phillies in the Astrodome  That my Western Division friends shows 
that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you 
think
 
  Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by
  midseason C'mon the Phillies haven't proved anything yet Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils  years ago They sucked They started having
  a good year but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
  division which is how it should be So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year not just a good  weeks they won't get any respect
  either BTW Atlanta's  BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are Their record is  Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting  hahahaha And Atlanta's hitting will
  improve dramatically

The Sox are the only undefeated team in the AL East after  days

Steve


As I have read this net the last few days I am continually amazed at the 
pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals  Especially when it 
comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer  As a long time Red Sox
fan I will simply say  The Impossible Dream Year   for those of you
with short memories short lives or both  

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
from those who only follow 'the hot team'  This statement is supported based
on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net  A true fan of a 
team any team will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
years and be amply rewarded when the time is right  

Yeah so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in   Who cares if
Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower  The
fact is they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
supported them  Now that it appears that they are on lean times the number of 
detracters come from all over  So what  Let them play and we will see what 
happens come September  The Red Sox may not be that good but they are certainly 
not that bad either and they do have a chance to win the World Series after all
remember the  Mets  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that
far let alone beat Baltimore

Let's face it Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football
and Basketball  Because of this one can never say with absolute certainity what
the outcome will be over the course of  games

Off and on over the last several months threads about RBIs and
related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can 
predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall
performance and the number of runners in scoring position RISP
that he bats with  In the Brock model Bill James calculated
predicted RBIs as RBITotal Bases  Home Runs  This 
completely ignores the context which was all that Brock 
could do since context was unknown to it  So I thought I'd
take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to
the data you get by comparing RBIHome Runs to SLGRISP

I've started with team data using data from the Elias's that
I've picked up over the years when a I could afford them and
b I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits
That gave me the years   and   I don't 
have team RBIs for ' or I could add that year  If you
run a simple least squares fit to the data you get 

RBIHome Runs  SLGRISP

The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is  which is
significant at a ridiculously high level  So I feel like the
fit is good at the team level  I've no started to move on to 
the player level and have looked at  players Will Clark
Ozzie Smith Joe Carter and Don Mattingly  I hope to 
add quite a few more during my copious free time this year

It doesn't do too badly except the equation underpredicts the
low HR hitter Smith which may be a fault of the model or it
could just be Ozzie  The results

                           RBIHR
         Years        Actual   Predicted
Carter              
Clark            
Matt'ly             
Smith               

I think we can make a case and I hope to make it stronger that
RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall
and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up

Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers one of 
my least favorite in LA Sweet  Also the Mets my other least 
favorite team loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a 
great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be
hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots
of hits and not many runs  Hopefully with the coaches stress on
situational hitting in spring training the runners LOB will be lower
this year probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and
Lankford and Zeile's off year

I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies  The media and all the 
Filly fans on rsb forget who is right behind them in the standings  
Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games 
and we'll see who is in first then  I believe the Cardinal pitching 
staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the
difference

On a side note a few years ago  a comment was made by some 
baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense  He was asked 
where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied Fair  I 
remember it being in the They Said It section of Sports Illustrated
I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in

Guess which line is which

The walks should give it away  OBP's in general somewhat more valuable than
slugging and Alomar's edge in OBP was quite a bit larger than Baerga's edge
in slugging

I'm no SDCN but what's more valuable

 hits w more doubles  more HRs   OR
 more triples and  BBs  Let's not forget the  extra SBs How many CS

Alomar had  CS  Baerga had 

Don't forget the  more outs Baerga had his GIDP balances out his CS and
he had one more sacrifice than Alomar   A replacement level second baseman
could have had  hits  walks and a couple of XBH for the additional
outs Baerga had  A triple is little different than a home run  We're talking
exchanging almost  walks for six or seven home runs and four doubles  I 
would say the almost walks are more valuable

Also Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from 
his And six or seven home runs Hmm

So if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in Toronto you'd take 
Alomar Anywhere else and you'd probably take Baerga

This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year and that
we've just had a rash of highscoring games  I bet this one day's worth
of games pulled everything back to close to average

Interesting because the other day all but three games had ten or more
runs scored and yesterday no game had more than nine

Most of the points you made about Lopez v BerryhillOlson have been
made by others and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of
Frank Thomas I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of
his supporters


Nope They're baseball management possible the most shortsighted 
collection of people in the nation Do you not believe this goes on
Mark Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in


See  This is essentially what everyone was doing    comparing Lopez
to one of the best players in the game  I'm really looking forward
to seeing this can'tmiss superstar now  As for Thomas I remember
being an advocate of his being brought up in  even though he was
only  or  can't remember  But who did the Sox have at first
Calderon  Martinez  Kittle  The spot was there  The talent was
there  Sure I say go for it

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in  and I am not convinced that Olson
Berryhill are nearly as bad as KittleMartinez were

BTW I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months





Or Cal Eldred wasn't really better than Ricky Bones last year

Well if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game
let's compare our decision to one of the most Boneshead right

Cal Eldred was  when he came up with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career  Frankly I don't know why he didn't
make the club in   Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a bigleague pitcher  No one   I repeat NO ONE  
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade  Though I guess
Mieske has a future

I take it back McIlvaine may have laughed louder



You're mostly polite make defensible if flawed cases have wit and
have in the past admitted being wrong That does qualify you on rsb
We'll make an SDCN out of you yet 


aw gee shucks  thanks guy  except I missed the part where SDCN's
admit they're wrong

Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the
BB DDD this year

The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first
atbat this year went  feet if I remember right I'll have to check
my scorecard at home  I think that's the longest so far in the Kingdome
through the first stand five games there  A weak showing despite some
promising taterball candidates  Ben McDonald Rich DeLucia and the
rest of the Mariner bullpen  making appearances

Anyone have the tapemeasure value for Omar Vizquel's grand slam in the

So who will start this year's All Star game for the AL
 
 Probably Alomar 
 
 Not to put him down he's a great player But it helps to have 
 all the recognition he's had plus to play in a city which is
 likely to pour in the votes

I like Alomar  But I'd like to differ with your opinion about a city
which is likely to pour in the votes

I attended many games last year during the balloting  I know that a
great number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots but left
them beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands  Toronto gets
no more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game

Unfortunately this is not a one time thing  I've attended games
during the last four seasons and it has happened every time  The
apathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me

NoHal McRae is the worst manager in baseball  I've never seen a guy who
can waste talent like he can  One of the best rawtalent staffs in the league
and he's still finding a way to lose  I'll be surprised if he makes it through
the next  weeks unless drastic improvement is made

I'm confused  How is it Hal McRae's fault that he can't win with a team 
whose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt  I mean let's be real  Kansas
City will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end
up near  they have less offense than any other team in baseball even
if you count the expansion teams

One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled
'Pitching is  of Baseball' implying that fielding is   How do
they determine that  Beats me  it's been a long long time since I
read it

This was my opinion the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game The
argument was

 Defense or runs allowed is  of the game
 Unearned runs amount to  of the runs allowed earned runs 

 Since unearned runs are the result of fielding not pitching and
earned runs are the product of pitching not fielding fielding is 
of defense and pitching is  of defense
 Caombining with  pitching is  of the game fielding 

Pete is usually sharper than that My own feel is that fielding is in
the  of defense range call it  between fielding and
pitching

One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the
split probably somewhere around  and 

I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe  or
even  Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats which wouldn't be that unreasonable and
even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base they'll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going firsttothird more often No offense

He writes about unusual situations that occured during the week  Unusual
stats  He has a section called Kinerisms of the Week which are stupid
lines by Mets brodcaster Ralph Kiner  Every year he has the LGTGAH contest
That stands for Last guy to get a hit  He also writes for Baseball 
America  That column is sort of a highlights of Week in Review  If you 
can check his column out sometime  He might make you laugh

Isn't Stark that idiot who writes in Baseball America   Twice a month he
writes a Who woulda thunk it article which is really the same piece
every time   Who would have thought that Buddy Biancalana would have
more home runs than the Colorado Rockies Babe Ruth Omar Vizquel and

Some discussion about whether Elias is money grubbing deleted

funny it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks
which are nothing BUT collections of statistics are authored by bill james
and stats inc and howe for the minor league handbook

and i am not sure how the  bill james player ratings book qualifies
as a book with statistics while the elias analyst is a statistics book
the analyst contains more stats sure but it also contains more dialogue

finally the point was not about the word statistics  it was about
moneygrubbing  i don't see how anyone who has looked at the bill
james player ratings book cannot consider him moneygrubbing

bob vesterman

Some thoughts and facts

  Bill James is a partial owner of STATS inc  However he has almost
nothing to do with the daytoday operations of the company although he
does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name
The handbook but not the scoreboard  To the best of my knowledge the
only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section
of the handbook and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook

 The debate over Elias goes way back  Bill James' early stuff was hampered
by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price
Project Scoresheet and later STATS were founded to fill this void  You
can call STATS and ask them for a report on just about anything in their
database and they will provide it  for a price of course  Or you could
just log into their online system and look at the data yourself  Having
attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past football not baseball they
just don't do that  In STATS eyes the high ground comes from making the
information available at all

  That being said I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year too
I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers 
desire to have the book come out sooner than April

Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer

Bias alert  I am a former parttime employee of STATS

Can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make
absolutely no sense  At least in the local Gannett rag that finds its way
to my door  I must have stared at Cleman in the Mets' box for a
good  seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was  Wouldn't
it make more sense to use Colemn

I've seen it as Colmn also

Blame the Associated Press  After the official scorer balances the
official score card they copy it and give it to several diffent people 
One of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up using a
template on a laptop and transmit it to the AP offices in New York
Rockefeller Center via the telephone  The box scores are not checked
and just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services  If there are
corrections those are issued later  It is the person sitting in front
of a laptop at Shea or whereever whose fault that is  NOTE The AP
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in
most newspapers being the first one

Not totally true  For the past year or two the AP has been getting box
scores from STATS Inc  The AP representative in the press box is actually
a STATS reporter  dollars a game but free parking  And anybody can
do it  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago some quick error 
checking is done and then STATS sends it to the AP  I'm not sure where
the appreveiations come in hear  I don't think it is at STATS's  It may
just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day 

While I'm mentioning STATS reporters they are always looking for new
people  Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh you're road
to getting into the press box may be real short  For more info call 
STATS   and ask about the reporter network  It's a fun
way to get paid for watching baseball games

End of public service announcement


Last week they were in Denver  Maybe the AP person in Denver did this
remember they just started with MLB out there  Check tomorrow's
paper  and see if the person who is doing it from Shea does the
same thing

DJ was a popular player in San Diego Derek Bell was not faring well in the
clubhouse at Toronto so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it
was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry

  I laugh at you now and I will laugh at you again equally publicly
when the Jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent

The Jays will finish third because of the depletion of their pitching staff
NOT because Derek Bell was traded for Darrin Jakson

I couldn't agree more  The Jays have a lot of power in their lineup 
So far pitching has been the biggest problem  Maybe we can get Acker back 

But anyway the point of my post if you missed it was that Derek Bell was
traded because he was basically in the doghouse with Cito and the rest of
the team

One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on
to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were
back in the clubhouse  Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air
waving a big towel over his head  He looked like a big jerk especially
when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole
season  The next day Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's
Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started  The stadium
announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's
jeep  Bell really freaked out I don't think Bell was to popular after that

I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now  He's known
for being a great outfielder  and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been
booting balls and playing generally awful

I gots ta know

	Dummy Hoy a late thCentury baseball player was deaf  In
order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or
strike the umpires developed hand signals  This also helped to relieve
the stress on umpires' vocal cords so they didn't have to shout STRIKE

    Well officially it's the Braves At least up until they started winning
    it was Are they still officially 
    If so why and how did they receive this label
    
    Unoffically but without a doubt America's Team is the Cubs Why
    Well my guess is because America loves underdogs Every year no matter
    the Cubs' talent or the predictions they never as close to never as
    possible win anything Over the years as the losing has mounted America
    has fallen in love with these perennial losers The Cubs have more fans
    in Chicago then some teams do worldwide The Cubs have more fans 
    worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined 
    An aura of excitement surrounds the Cubs at the beginning of the season
    like no one else including the WS champs It must be that Eternal Hope
    this is the year they've got the talent they're off to a good start
     they've got the pitching or hitting or whatever their strong point is
     at the time It's that inevitability that the Cubs WILL eventually 
     win the WS again When Only God knows Since it's been so long it 
    could come at any time or it could be another  years But until they
    do finally win and start winning consistently The Cubs will remain

	You are absolutely correct  Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of
bandwagoners  Correct me if I am wrong but  or  years ago you couldnt give
away a ticket to see the Braves playI  would bet my next paycheck that  of
the socalled Braves fans living outside of Georgia at the present time can not
name more than  players from their  season On the other hand ask any
Cubs fan living anywhere in the United States to name  players from any given
year and  of them probably could
	Granted the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park but
that does not mean they diserve the title America's Team
	The only reason they are considered America's team is because of Ted
Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation
	I'll consider Toronto AMerica's team before the Braves

So Alfredo Griffin is better than Barry Larkin

If rings is what you're judging by then I don't see your point since Barry
has one 

Yes but Alfredo has at least two  Dodgers and  Blue Jays
Not only that he has won World Series rings for more different teams than
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig combined how do we know that the Yankee dynasty
was not due to Lazarri being at third 

	Warren I agree with your premise but The Babe won on
two teams That's right he was part of the Red Sox Dynasty of the
s And everyone knows that the Yankee Dynsaty wouldn't have
happened without thier famous bullpen catcher whose name escapes me at
the moment

Tim Belcher pitched a dandy threehit shutout tonight as Cincinnati won 
their second straight   Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and 
often by the heavily rightunbalanced Reds lineup which managed some
recently rare power with their bats

Belcher  was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the
game progressed  Early on he had several threeball counts but even those
were few and far between later on as he allowed only one baseonballs while
striking out nine  In a post game interview he said his changeup was working
for himI should say so  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on 
breaking balls

Tomlin  on the other hand was in trouble early giving up a secondpitch
double to leadoff batter Bip Roberts  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and 
Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right  The big guys
Mitchell Sabo Milligan were unable to get anything after thatin fact
they all struck outbut Kelly managed a score anyway due to a doublesteal
and a Tomlin wild pitch

In fact it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky
start he retired  of the next  batters to get to the fourth behind only
  Randy Milligan though had different ideas as his lineshot was
poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple  Milligan would 
later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly giving Cinci the  lead 
after 

The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second
double of the game and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the 
left field line chasing Tomlin  Barry later would score the final run on
Tom Prince's twobase passed ball  

The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the
fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit backtoback singles the second 
being of the bunt variety but Carlos Garcia struck out Prince fit a 
foul fly and pinchhitter Lonnie Smith K'd to end any Pittsburgh hope

Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well though  relievers Blas Minor
Moeller sp and Nagel gave up only two hits in their fourplus innings
work

Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he misplayed 
bruised his right thumb  He was taken to the hospital for precautionary
Xrays  Let's hope he's OK

Cincinnati is now  still the worst record in the majors but with the
two wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar
Pittsburgh is now

How about Brooks Robinson's last homerun ever   came on  at

Larry Harlow was due up but Brooks pinchhit a  pitch from Dave LaRoche

I agree with Nick  What's the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball there's that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

I don't really mind the length of games either  If they want to speed
the games up in sensible ways that's fine with me too  However what
I object to is the assertion by baseball people Whitey Herzog Buck
Rodgers are who I've heard say this that games are too long because
hitters are taking too many pitches and that the strike zone needs to
be expanded

Dale Stephenson says

The events I saw were
  Called strike by Hirschbeck
  Shockedlooking Gant asks for appeal to first
  No appeal to first
  Gant steps out of batters box
  Hirschbeck immediately orders Gant back in  bad move

Even I noticed that Gant's demeanor was not one of a batter
attempting to regain his concentration  Gant was stalking off
I wonder if Gant said something to the ump

  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off bad move

Actually there was a small hand wave by Gantas if to say
'Don't bother me' Gant may have said something here too

  Hirschbeck yells at Gant  Gant is silent
  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch
  Pitch is called a strike
  Cox argues couldn't see when he came on the field

Cox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called

  Cox is ejected players everywhere
  Play finally resumes

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out the
whole incident probably would have been avoided

My impression was that Gant was not 'stepping out'  He was making
a protest about the lack of an appeal to first  As has been
pointed out earlier there is no appeal to first on a strike
I can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a twoout
RISP    game ninth inning  He let it get to him  The ump
also overreacted  Gant was stalking off but I doubt he would
have been gone long  Hirschbeck should have let him have a
moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat
IMHO umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck
showed  Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely
he would not get a hit

A very bad finish to a pretty good game

As the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not

consistent hitter  definitely the best in the National League  IMHO to 
have Williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting
th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the
Giants

 simple reasons

   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get
      more good pitches to hit  This is important since he struggles
      so much with breaking balls  Opposing pitchers don't want to
      walk Williams to get to Bonds

I don't understand this at all  Matt Williams has demonstrated
throughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit
He won't take walks  He'd rather swing  If I'm the opposing pitcher
why would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well
when I know that Williams will swing and miss or at least not hit
very well at a low and away curve

Hey folks

Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday April   It was the game
where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a twoout
tworun homer to right to win it  It wasn't the game where the fans 
threw the giveaway fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer 
too bad huh

Well the 'Stick is still cold  The Saturday game ended at pm and it
was cold then  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick  The
wind kicked up a little too and I got this idea

At most games there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on
the field a lot of the time  I propose a Kid's Cleanup Corps composed
mainly of  year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
out on the field in the fifth inning when the guy in the Toro smooths
the infield and grab the trash

It might not be glamorous but at that age I probably would have given
anything to be on the field with the ballplayers  Everybody wins here

Whaddaya think

You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched
in between Clark and Bonds  He must and I mean MUST get fastballs to
hitotherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise
What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds Williams and Clark
 the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing
abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners
I think the chance of getting  extra stolen bases with Bonds in the
 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having 
Clark in the  spot

 Before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the Jays
 have won the AL with a good pitcher from AAA in place of Morris given
 his run support  How about an average ML pitcher  I can't believe
 that Morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive
 impact on the Jays performance 

I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris but let's give credit
where credit is due

It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris

Well when you say without Morris you have to mention an assumed
replacement  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston
softtoss the ball underhand to the opposition every  days then
of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris  If the
alternative was replacement level then I think it would've been very
close and yes Morris might've made the difference  If the alternative
was Frank Viola the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with
Viola

Last year when the team went  for the month of August and all the 
other starters were being shelled and Milwaukee was making a charge
Morris went  with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly

Yes  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented 
the team from collapsing in August

Also let's not underestimate the importance his  innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day  If he didn't help us win the AL east forget
about the pennent and the world series

Those innings were probably helpful

His run support was high  runs but so was Stottlemyer's  runs
and he won only  games  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of
 and  ballgames but this is to his credit  He pitched only as good
as he needed to be  When he was up  in a ballgame he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
I hate this expression  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  But Morris being a 
veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball  By saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra
I hate this too when the game was on the line

Well I think is complete bs  What happened most of the time is that
Morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued him  Mostly
this is because he's a lousy st inning pitcher and much better
the rest of the way  That the team can climb out of   holes
consistently and win them  is not to Morris' credit it's to the
team's credit

Furthermore while Morris did exceed the WL percentage that would
be projected from his runs allowed and run support he hasn't done
this in previous years  In fact his WL record in  is a lot
worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed
Do you think he just came up with this ability in 

Look at the  postseason games he pitched decently in  Typical
Morris games  Morris gets behind team rescues him  He's not
responsible for that rescue  And in both those games the team
just didn't rescue him enough  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did
during much of the season in those  games the offense just didn't
earn him a victory

BTW I think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a 
veteran pitcher which Cito would never do but his era is  how much more
can he be embarrassed

Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start
anymore he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen

Did anyone happen to see Peter Gammons on ESPN last night  He addressed
this exact issue and dismissed it rather quickly  According to Gammons
advanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have
the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability
to keep the ball hidden during his release  Guzman and Stottlemyre have
gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a
little work with the pitching coach  Gammons looks to see Morris back in
top form within the month

I on the other hand still have my doubts  Morris' ERA last year was
rather high for a pitcher who won  games  His showing in the Series was
not surprising  Although I'm not convinced that he's washed up I have my
doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the
Twins in '

First a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball

I definitely do  That's why I don't like going to see games played
on artificial turf 

The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches

And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this
is only true when they don't become extralong

Well your idea of interesting differs from mine  I think
batting practice is interesting for example and make a special
effort to get to the game very early in order to see it  I think the
delaying tactics of batters pitchers catchers and managers are
interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control
of the flow and timing of the game  Of course the umpires can and
should intervene when these tactics get out of hand  As Ryan Robbins
has pointed out there are rules that cover this

One of the more fascinating things about baseball I think is its
openendedness with regard to time  You never know if the game is going
to zip right by and be over in less than two hours or if it's going to
go on until four in the morning  Likewise some games are actionpacked
and some games are slow and lazy  That's fine by me  Those folks who
want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel
surf and cater to their short attention spans

Does anybody know what is going on with Lankford I know he was
out for a few games with a slight injury but since he has
beenback and before the injury for that matter he has been
really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths
 
Whereis the Ray Lankford we saw last year


I beg to differ he had a couple  hit games after he came back  He did
get caught stealing though  He also missed sunday's game  Did he play
tonight  If not I'm worried  He's on my team too

As the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not
batting th for the Giants behind Will Clark  Barry is such an awesome and
consistent hitter  definitely the best in the National League  IMHO to 
have Williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting
th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the
Giants

 simple reasons

   Batting Williams ahead of Bonds will create a LeftClark 
      RightWilliams LeftBonds situation in the middle of the
      batting order  This makes it tougher for opposing manager
      to change pitchers

   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get
      more good pitches to hit  This is important since he struggles
      so much with breaking balls  Opposing pitchers don't want to
      walk Williams to get to Bonds

Both your reasons are not good ones  Joe Morgan thinks that BondsClark
Williams should be the  hitters  While he believes that ClarkBonds
Williams is fine he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit
ahead of Williams  I am inclined to agree with him
Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties
very well  He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant
Williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season
But the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive
hitter than Williams and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in
the   or  hitters who are expected to have high OBPs than with Williams
Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open
because of the threat of Bonds stealing

You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched
in between Clark and Bonds  He must and I mean MUST get fastballs to
hitotherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise
What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds Williams and Clark
 the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing
abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners
I think the chance of getting  extra stolen bases with Bonds in the
 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having 
Clark in the  spot

Matt


Williams does not like hitting cleanup
Secondly Bonds and Clark in that order are a lot more productive with
runners in scoring position than Matt I am streaky free swinger Williams

Your list of Jewish ballplayers includes Levi Samuel Meyerle son of

Meyerle's surviving relatives say he wasn't Jewish according to
Nineteenth Century Stars published by SABR in  Incidentally
Long Levi he was foot batted  in the first season of the
National Association the first pro league Needless to say he hasn't
been topped yet Of course the NA is not considered a major league

	Granted the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park but
that does not mean they diserve the title America's Team
	The only reason they are considered America's team is because of Ted
Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation

This is precisely why they were considered America's team  Even
especially when they were bad you could see most of the Braves games on
cable  You could do that for the Cubs as well but the Braves had better
camerawork better announcers what would you rather listen to  Harry discuss
the game or Skip and Pete discuss motoball and teams that weren't too
much worse  Because of TBS the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia
At home in Kentucky even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was
as many Braves fans as Reds fans even in   You could actually watch the
Braves play  you had to go to Cincinnati to watch the Reds  I can go

Tim Wallach can be explained with the rabbitball  Deion can be explained

Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI's
This is the situation that brought the question up

The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the th by a score of   The Mariners
had the bases loaded with  out  The batter hits a fly to center which the
fielder catches  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw  

Now without a judgement call and I don't think there is one this is an RBI
for the batter  It seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive
indifference since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores
at that point  I know I can think of several If the Mariners stole third
and second which opening the base would allow and then the batter hit a
grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and
third he wouldn't have a play at home third or second for the out and
maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out etc
scenarios too  But does it really matter if this guy scores this way when
you're down by   If the tying run is going to score so is the guy on third

The point is that the batter IMO shouldn't get credit an RBI for utterly
failing to do his job  which at this point is to get a hit or a walk not
trade an out for one run  What do you guys think

Total Baseball which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensive
and defensive contributions gives Barry Bonds a Total Player rating of
 for  Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark Cal
Ripken for his  season Rounding out the top five offensive players
in the NL last season Sheffield  Sandberg  Van Slyke  and
Larkin 

The top  offensive players in the AL in  were E Martinez 
Ventura  Anderson  R Henderson  and Thomas 

In short Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons
ever in the game's history  better than any year had by Mantle
Mays Williams etc If you disagree don't flame me flame the
writers of Total Baseball Also Martinez and Ventura are neck and
neck so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis which one
had the better year can be considered a tossup Thus Total Baseball
supports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of

Now that time has passed what would the posts be like if Rickey were driving
his boat drunk killing himself and one of his teammates  What would people
say if Bonds drunk out of his skull smashed his car into a tree disabling
himself  say Willie McGee for the season  I can tell you  They would be
considered spoiled lazy say it niggers  

	This awfully presumptious of you to assume you can read our minds and
predict the future  What makes you so sure I would be thinking these things
What makes you think that there's not a lot of people out there don't think
Crews is a god  Anyone who is dead because of a mistake deserves sympathy be
it Crews Olin Bonds McGee Rickey or you or meWhy does it bother you so 
much that two dead white men are getting a little sympathy Would it make you 
feel better if we only mourned dead black baseball players

To beat a dead horse I seem to remember a fair amount of sympathy for 
some black fringe player named Roberto Clemente  And for Roy 
Campanella  And for Thurman Munson  And for just about anyone else 
who we may not even have liked as players but mourned for dying too young

Wiggins Alan

But that's besides the point  I'm sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed  But they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions

Example  

How about Jose Canseco  He gets a couple of speeding tickets and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time

Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year  Two years ago  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity etc  

Meanwhile Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton and I didn't
read any sportswriter complaining about that  They may have talked
about how bad it was for the Phillies but I NEVER read anywhere
criticism of Dykstra's character or Daulton's intelligence for that
matter based on this incident

If black players can't survive being mediocre or worse how can McRae

Nobody's saying it's a hard and fast rule  My point is that white

I went through TB III and made a list of year OF and B who were 
negative in both Adjusted Batting Runs and Total Player Rating  TPR
has some problems but it's generally not too far off for a career

A few black players there a lot of white and hispanic

Hmmmone questionHow do you differentiate hispanic and black
After all some people fall into both categoriesRafael Ramiriez
comes to mindand he'd fit into this grouping also
oopshe's not an OFBalthough he is a lighthitting
utility player  Sorry about that  But Miguel Dilone would
qualify if I remember correctly

When I say black I mean USborn black people for the purposes of this
discussion  Hispanic players were in baseball before  and one 
team in the 's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did  

And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

Don't know  But remember this is the country that had special racial
laws for one group and one group only blacks  Our national history 
includes huge longterm global tensions regarding the black minority 
the hispanic minority while often discriminated against has never been
the object of national obsession

It might also be worth your while to subdivide the data into careers
starting at year intervals  I would think that your prediction
would be most true for careers starting in the 's and least true
for careers starting in the 's  Of course you'd also have to
compare total ML racial percentages for the era in question

But it certainly did exist and all out talk of TWG's and all that is

I'm of the opinion that your point is less valid today than it was

I like the ClarkWIlliamsBonds order
Pitchers can only walk Clark with  outs unlike last year

Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming
in the ondeck circle  Since Matt has a terrible batting eye
this helps the Giants a lot

When Bonds gets on base all by himself he can try to steal nd
and then be driven in with a single by Thompson Manwaring or Clayton

If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers then you don't want
him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a
big inning

Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he
is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double

The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the 
bases infront of Bonds and I think that's a problem the 
Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot

 In any case I think Viola would have made a better signing  Why
 Viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does
 Toronto have

Well I agree that Viola is a better signing  However why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect eg Yankee Stadium

The answer is  they're stupid  Seriously I think you're right
on the money I've never understood the preoccupation with making
sure a rotation has lefthanded starters  The only time it makes
sense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main
rivals is loaded with lefthanded hitters  Other than that I think
you're completely right

Brock Coleman and Wilson were hotdog basestealers also Lonnie Smith
that seems to be a special class  CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get 
more of a break especially if they actually do field well  And Brock
wasn't all that bad a hitter either not until the end there when he 
spoiled his ifetime  BA

And again I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time  But if
you look at the history of the last three decades there seems to 
be a clear racebased pattern by which utility players and platoon

Light hitting   HR  lifetime OPS mainly with HOUSTON

Stole  bases  Ok he's still lighthitting but baseball managers don't

man  Awesome defense

Darnell Coles

He's still around because of his  when he hit  HR

Henry Cotto

Hasn't played  years in the bigs  Wasn't a fulltime majorleaguer

Manny Mota

Consistent  hitter

Billy Hatcher

We'll see if he's still around in  for his tenth year

Herm Winningham

Same goes for Herm

Lonnie Smith not light hitting but a horror in the field

Doesn't count then

Gary Redus

Redus is hardly lighthitting plus he stole  bases  Close to
 OPS career against LHP

Dion James

We'll see if he's still around in  to qualify

Daryl Boston

Slugged  to  for three straight years in one of the worst hitters'
parks in the NL  He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this
year  Plus to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver
and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox

Vince Coleman yeah he's finally started to have a decent OBP

Coleman assuming he makes it to  was never perceived as being
weak offensively though of course he was  Led NL in SB his first six
years in the majors

Cecil Espy

We'll see if he's still around in 

Willie Wilson

Wilson has always been overrated but hit  five times in a sixyear
stretch and led the league in triples five times  But we can count him
if he's still playing in  though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon
deluxe with slightly worse defense

Gary Pettis

Okay if he's in the league this year he can count though he's also
in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome

Milt Thompson

He's not spectacular but he's neither lighthitting nor a tenyear man

Halfway there and unlikely to make it  of the way there

In spite of what all the STAT heads say Jack Morris played a large role in
the Jays winning the World Series last year I don't care if his era was 
he played a leadership role and did win  games His ERA may have been high
but he did pitch many outstanding ball games

And he pitched many notsooutstanding ballgames too

Jack essentially pitched a lot of  ball last year  This certainly
isn't irrelevant and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality
the Blue Jays might not win

Re leadership I don't see it  If the leadership effect is there for
a starting pitcher you would expect to see its primary effect on the
pitching staff  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve
Instead the rest of the staff declined

You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership
the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous
year I'm not saying I buy that but at least that argument makes
internal sense

My father is a huge Tiger fan and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan who endured the collapse of  the heartbreak of   

I don't have the stat book so let's throw them out

First of all Morris in his heyday  vs Clemens present

How many Cy Youngs does Morris have

How many Cy youngs does Clemens have

Ballparks and such Fenway average pitchers park  Detroit hugh hitters
paradise   

Morris is a great team pitcher sort of in the Doug Drabek mold  
If Morris's team needs a well pitched game as in Minn in  Morris
snaps the ball and throw for Ks  Otherwise he just tries to get people out

As for Clemens in the Elias Stat Book of  I believe
that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team as compared to
when he doesn't pitch  How bad would the Red sox have been last year
without him  Can you say  Phillies

I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power and hsi
great tenacity  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers Ive ever seen
but Clemens is in a class with Seaver Carlton etc

maynardramseycslaurentianca Roger Maynard writes

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu
tion  from the rest of the team's  There is only one way of determin
ing best in baseball  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game  Each game determines which team is the best
that day  At the end of the season the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division  The playoffs determine the
best of the best  But the point is that the only decision making pro
cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re
lates to the teams  Not the individual players  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  And that
is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game

And you know what  There is no such method inherent in real life
either  So I would assume you would endorse the notion that we 
cannot state with any level of objectivity that Mother Theresa
has accomplished more good in this world than Joseph Stalin
After all life on earth is a team effort

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria then fine  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS  because  that is the
only measure of best that has any meaning in the  context  of  base
ball   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub
jective  and  is  mere opinion  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon

Have you tried glasses  I find them quite useful  

After all there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds
of evidence we present  It's too bad you feel it necessary to close
your mind and eyes to knowledge you live a poorer life as a result
of that choice

Heck I'd wager that you could predict a WS winner with greater
accuracy than Jeanne Dixon  And you know why  Because I have
full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary
you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up
with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level   

You don't have to be rude

Have you tried calling a kettle black

For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy  Ignoratio
Elenchi  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   although  I  have  tongue in cheek claimed
that in the past  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per
formance

In other words in your world you cannot objectively state that
Jack Morris was more important to the Blue Jays than Al Leiter last
year

In your world that may indeed be true  Fortunately in the world
the rest of us occupy it's not

I hope you never serve on a jury Roger  I think the rest of the
jury would have to kill you  There's no way I can objectively
judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty  You see there are
 billion other people on this planet  We have no way of knowing
whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn't
for all the other people on the planet  We have no way of knowing
how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet
because living on this planet is a team effort  And no individual
committs a crime totally isolated from his society he is a part of
that society  That being case anything I have to say on his
culpability would be absolute subjectivity so I refuse to vote

The injury is to his fielding hand which is good  Unfortunately he may
have some ligament damage and may require surgery which would lay him up
for a while

I don't know about Jefferies

Apparently just a strain of some sort  He hasn't been put on the DL so

As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him the

should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling
prophecy

I don't understand  If it is Williams' lack of ability which you say
above and I agree with which causes him to swing at bad pitches how
will thinking that Bonds hitting behind him will help him to stop
chasing bad pitches

I didn't mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that
specific deficiency  I meant that if having Bonds bat behind him
gives Williams possibly unfounded confidence that might translate
into more hitting productivity  But you're right  if Williams'
biggest problem is more physical than mental that's less likely
to make a difference

Since Roger is a Canadian who probably knows nothing about baseball
I am gonna try to explain it to him in terms of hockey

according to his logic
I can say that since Bob Errey is better than Wayne Gretzky

heyErrey contributed to  Cups while good old Wayne has won nothing
I think the Kings should trade Gretzky for Erreywhat do you think Roger

 Felix J                       

I suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning  An
outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a
lot of balls preventing both singles and doubles and also cut off more
uncatchable balls turinging doubles into singles  However a fielder
who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies this
means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles

Has anyone seen these players' positioning  Do Butler and Felix play
deep and Lankford Martinez and Wilson shallow or is this a park
effect  I thought Butler liked to play shallow

You simply cannot show up an umpire like Ron Gant did  It is disrespectful
of not only the home plate umpire but of the dignity of the game

But of course it is expected that umpires will show up players

Don't get me wrong I understand the nature of the game but I just 
believe that a little egoectomy for the umpires would make the game 
much better

 Last night Boston Red Sox win its  games of  games by beating Seattle
   Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate  He walked at least  man in
 first  inns  But Valetin and Greenwell hit homeruns and Red Sox prevail

Clemens struggled with his control but was also the beneficiary
of some pretty shoddy umpiring but to be fair most of the walks were
early in the game and he adjusted he was also helped by dare i say
it some pretty good defense by the Sox including Rivera playing
at second not his normal position

actually Clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win considering the Sox
almost gave up the lead in the bottom of the th on Mo's error catching
a throwover

 I think that game is must win for Red Sox in Seattle considering Darwin will
 faced Seattle ace Randy Johnson tonight

must win in April
they've already won  more games so far than anyone thought they would at this 
point of the season i hope people aren't getting too caught up
in this streak it's been fun but teams have  streaks all the time
and it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get
so much attention

o any of you experts want to analyze Ron Gant

omeone sure needs to analyze him  Gant is a head case  In his what six or
seven years in the Majors he's put together a combined total of maybe one
good season  He lacks selfconfidence but worse he doesn't really
understand baseball  Curiously he seems to perform best when his job
is threatened  Sit him down for a game and he might get a hit the next
night  But let him play and what is he thinking about  Getting hits
driving in runs  No he's worried if he's going to get that  stolen
bases or that th career home run  He appears to have no learning curve
He never figured out how to play third base what a fiasco  He still
plays the outfield with his legs  He's lucky he's so fast because it enables
him to outrun his mistakes but as I suggested earlier in the season it
looks to me like he's slowing down a little bit or else every groundskeeper
is watering the infield dirt a little extra

Gant has had way too much of a chance already  He may get hot again for
a couple of months but he'll always revert to his true level

Gant's ML record  Age  this season

Year   G   AB     BA   OBP   SLG   HR   SB  CS
                       
                     rd Base Expt year
                      
                  
                  
                  

In the majors for parts of  seasons total playing time
approx  seasons

Just looking at his hitting record he's had  seasons of OPS
greater than  which is pretty good for an OF  His
 season is pretty decent for a rookie B  The move to
third base explains a lot of his   When he returned as an OF
he began hitting again  And of course last year he slumped

But no learning curve  He has obviously improved his batting eye
over the years as well as his SBCS ratio  As to his fielding
he was an infielder when he was drafted a Bman as he came
up through the Braves system and then the Braves put him through
 position changes in the space of a year  He's an adequate OF
although not great and at least some of your perception of his
fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the
ML level  I know you're another longterm Braves fan 

About playing BIMO that's the nd most DIFFICULT position
to field after catcher  At SS or B you need more range and 
speed but at B you've got to have quick reflexes and have 
a GUN for an arm  There are NO second chances at B even when
playing sandlot softball  Granted I'd still put my best
overall infielder at SS but that's because he gets more
chances not because the job is harder  It still amazes me
that so many teams have tried to convert other position players
to B  But maybe that's because the supply of natural B is
scarce

Finally Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to
perform well and works hard to improve  You don't get
those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a
lot of weight work  Now whether he's been overdoing it these
days may be a valid question as is the question of whether
he tries too hard to make something happen during each atbat
But frankly if a player is going to not live up to potential
I'd much rather they fail by trying too hard than by not
trying hard enough  You might be able to teach relaxation
to an adult but at that age I don't believe you can teach
hustle

All that said I don't think I'd sign Gant to another longterm
contract  He's  now and I think he's freeagent eligible
in  years when he'll be   Given his career curve and
limitations I wouldn't expect him to last much past 
as a ML ballplayer  He might surprise me here but Atlanta's
got some talent on the farm and I'd rather take my chances
down the road with Nieves et al

Of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that Galarraga's
inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he isn't
paid to walk or is an RBI guy or whatever
Alright that's enough I've suffered with all kinds of insults as
typical for the net but give me a break Galarraga is currently
batting over  and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing
enough walks  What would he have to do to please you guys bat 
You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team

It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average Yes the
April  USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a  batting average
and a  OBP That's on for hitting with  zip nil nada walks
The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history
of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability except for
drawing walks If he hit  for say even  AB's I'd be convinced that
there was a real change in his ability If he did it with an OBPAVG I'd
not only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in
the history of the game But what do  AB's prove Look at some of the
other fluke players at this point in the season
  Player    AVG AB
  Blauser   
  Grace     
  Milligan  
  Conine    
  Lansing   
  Slaught   
Are any of these guys really that good Well in a word no How significant
is Galarraga's average At the  AB level a hit is worth about  If
he'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good
defensive play he'd be in the  range If he goes for in his next
game he's all the way down to  In one game Come back in June Let's
talk then

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen
THEN I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches My comment
that he isn't paid to walk doesn't mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it's more along the lines of he's
batting  and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference
does it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks Sheesh

It's history Greg Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because he
swings at bad pitches so his average isn't very good  AB's doesn't mean
an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand especially when
there's ample evidence  BB in  that his basic hitting approach hasn't
changed Yeah he might suddenly have turned into a  hitter who never
walks but don't bet the rent money on it

Hey folks

Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday April   It was the game
where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a twoout
tworun homer to right to win it  It wasn't the game where the fans
threw the giveaway fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer 
too bad huh

Well the 'Stick is still cold  The Saturday game ended at pm and it
was cold then  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick  The
wind kicked up a little too and I got this idea

At most games there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on
the field a lot of the time  I propose a Kid's Cleanup Corps composed
mainly of  year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
out on the field in the fifth inning when the guy in the Toro smooths
the infield and grab the trash

It might not be glamorous but at that age I probably would have given
anything to be on the field with the ballplayers  Everybody wins here

Whaddaya think

Sean

i was at opening day the stadium and new owners were great i pick candlesti

I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like
McGwire Bonds and Frank Thomas was rational  
I just said that it exists

But why McGwire and not Carter  I can see some justification for Bonds or
Thomas because they tend to have higher batting averages but the major
difference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesn't draw
walks  Why aren't pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter

During spring training I made a similarly innoncentlooking comment 
about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying  no such
thing as clutch hitting they the SDCN's all screamed  I assumed
they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance
given their comments  I'm still licking the wounds but I do have
a rebuttal planned      gotta do my homework as they say

some deletions
       Rather they showed quite convincingly that
	past clutch performance has never been able to predict FUTURE
	clutch performance

I'm sure you are convinced Dave  Apparently so is Tony Perez
I however am not


I believe at the time of the Sabo plate appearance that Juan Samuel
was on the bench available for pinchhit duty  Over the past four
seasons

		NonClutch			Clutch	 
		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA

Sabo								
Samuel									

I do not claim that this is a complete statistical analysis that
proves the existence of clutch hitting or compelling testimony that
Samuel would have gotten a base hit  I'm sure there is something wrong
with the sample size or that the basic assumption that clutch
performance is random invalidates any conclusions from this limited
application  Or something or other  I don't pretend to understand
statistical analysis


Well we agree on the last part  One of the basic things you need to 
have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year  A 
player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year
A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated
better  That is to say given their past performance in those statistics
we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year  Put in 
some simple information about aging and you can do even better  One of 
the basic problems with something like clutch batting average  overall
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero 
Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much  As a counterexample to 
what you showed consider the following two players from 

               NonClutch                      Clutch
               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA
 
Maldonado                                      
Lemon                                          

If you had had these two players in  by your logic in those clutch
situations you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye  Well in 
 Maldonado hit  in nonclutch and  in clutch while Lemon
hit  in nonclutch and  in clutch  Before you accuse me of 
completely cooking the data there were  players who had  clutch
at bats every year from  according to Elias  As a simple
measure of clutchness let's just look at clutch BAnonclutch BA If you use 
'' to predict ' for those  players you'd find that  of the
 were below league average in that measure both in ' and in '
 were above league average in both periods and the other  were 
above in one and below in the other  If you were just flipping coins
you'd expect to get  abovebelow in both and  that switched  The
difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment
is not statisically significant

BTW correlating players' overall batting average from '' with
' gives a correlation coefficient of  which is significant at
something better than the  confidence level  Correlating their
clutchnonclutch BA for the same period gives a correlation of 
 significant at no level of any interest



       Everyone would agree I hope that a grand 
	slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three
	is a VERY clutch hit  There is just no way to predict who is more
	likely to get the clutch hit based on past performance hitting in
	clutch situations


If you say so Dave  No way          


Actually it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future
clutch performance  It's more correct to say that we can't predict
future clutch performance with any skill

if this is true note that i don't think it is lasorda should be
fired for at least two reasons

          publicly humiliating his players
          knuckling under to his players wishes

There is a fine line between getting players' input and knuckling
under to players' demands  A manager much like a military officer
needs to have his her players' complete obedience and respect during
a game  After the game it's no big deal but when there is no time 
to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often
falls apart see Boston Red Sox ff    

Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like
demands  I suspect that a comment like I enjoy hitting fourth I'm
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if
it came from Strawberry  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying
I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best
in that role  Paraphrased by my memory and bias  That seems like
a fairly nonpetulant answer to what was almost certainly a question 
like How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order
A more mediasensitive player might answer The manager knows what he is
doing  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team then I
am all for it  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a
little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant

Personally I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't
matter much in which order the  players in the order are batted
except for personal stats  If I were Darryl I'd probably answer that
question The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get
paid for RBIs  I think it is best for me to bat fourth but I am willing
to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team  or something like
that  It would be helpful at salary timemy RBIs were down because I was
hitting thirdand make him sound like a team player  Since Strawberry
will not likely go through arbitration but use the free agent market for
his next contract maybe that argument is useless but it would help   
his image with the media without appearing to be totally contentfree

Remember the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hit
fourth so the argument is sensible regardless of whether or not it is
true

Does anybody in the Pittsburgh area know why Mike LaValliere was released
Last year I kept saying that Slaught should get the bulk of the playing time
that he was clearly the better player at this point but Leyland insisted on
keeping a pretty strict platoon  And now he is released  That doesn't
make any sense to me

Greg

    The story goes like this

       Spanky is too slow  If he were quicker he would still be here
But with Slaught and Tom Prince they didn't want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that th pitcher  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely

Well my question still hasn't been answered if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year why did he get so much playing time last year  Yes I know
he was part of a platoon and that's why he got more playing time than
Slaught but that doesn't answer the question  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year wasn't this also obvious last year and shouldn't he
have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties

Polish and Jewish are not mutually exclusive


I didn't mean to offend or anything I'm just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN and the interviewer can't remember who asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he the interviewer was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers To which Stanky replied I'm Polish not Jewish

So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax Greenberg and Blomberg

One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't
yet been addressed  I believe the rule also does not deal with this
situation

However if the Infield Fly is not caught at what point can a runner
legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too
early  

	The runner can leave his base at any time  If the ball is caught
he's got to tag up  If it isn't caught he doesn't have to tag up at
all  So if he's feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up  If it isn't caught he's probably scored
a run  If it is he's probably headed for AAA  

	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out
thereby removing the force on the runners on base  All other rules apply
as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up

This is fascinating  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last 
year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga
had a better year  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP

Well OBP is the most important offensive statistic and by a big margin
 points of OBP is worth considerably more than  points of slugging
That being said I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be and he can't turn the DP
to save his life  He comes across the bag improperly and his release
is slow  Considering the high leverage of the DP this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook  In the long term I'd move Alomar to another position

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something I'll be Alomar
could be a hell of a CF  In the long run I think I'd rather have Jeff
Kent at B and Alomar in CF than AlomarWhite

 The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
 death but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet
 
 Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
 on and his club down by a run  He stroked a line drive into the
 right field corner  The ball cleared the threefoot high fence and
 went into the crowd  Darryl racing over from right center got to
 the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he
 missed the ball  A fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt
 reached up and caught the ball  Home run
 
 Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
 Darryl missed the ball and that the fan's glove was essentially
 behind Darryl's  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
 vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
 Strawberry  What cannot be disputed however is that the fan
 who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious
 to where the fielder was playing  He was also quite exuberant as
 soon as he realized he had made the catch
 
 Stuff about Daryl and Tommy and everyone blaming fan for the loss deleted

I saw the replay several times too  No question about it  Daryl missed
the ball then the fan caught it  Daryl is so tall that he had the
first shot at the ball  Daryl's just whining again  I think it shows a
lack of class when Tommy Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan for
losing the game  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball
What about the pitchers that gave up  runs up to that point  Sorry Tommy
If it were a  game and Daryl was  feet  inches tall then maybe 
just maybe  you'd have an argument

I've been following the Giants closely over the offseason  newspapers
notesgroup etc  but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year Barry's swing was 
very impressive  he's very quick and his swing seems effortless even
compared to Clark particularly Clark as of late

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits b b hr for  rbi's

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better  Clayton's defense has been superb
McGee seems to like leading off this year  Manwaring is driving the ball
So on  so forth

I hope it continuesI think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching

For myself I think the fresh start of MagowanBakeretc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year

Buck Showalter just can't win 

Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings Yanks
lead  so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game Wickman manages to get two outs but in between four funs score
and all of a sudden it's  and Wickman just can't get the third out
So Buck goes to the bullpen and Farr gets out the first guy he faces

Last night Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life this guy just keeps getting better through eight innings Yanks
lead  This time Buck thinks I don't want a repeat of that
nearfiasco with Wickman so I'll give my bullpen some work Steve Howe
whose ERA was  coming into the game left with it at  He didn't
do too good Then Farr comes in He gives up a tworun homer and the
Royals win it 

What's going on This is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead Farr  Howe have done it twice together
Monteleone's done it once and I think even Habyan did it once What's the
deal We finally have terrific starting pitching so all of a sudden our
bullpen turns to shit

What's Buck gonna do And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen

If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up
and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball

However if the Infield Fly is not caught at what point can a
runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early  When the
ball hits the ground  When a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground

Enlightenment would be appreciated

I'm not sure I understand this question When the IF rule is invoked
the batter is automatically out This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught Other
than that isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball That is
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run or decide to stay and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time

   Astros relief corps holding together  If Doug Jones keeps his changeup
     effective and Xavier Hernandez can be effective then it's passable
     There's no reasonable lefthanded help and the middle relief is iffy
     Tom Edens was expected to take over the Joe Boever setup man role but
     he's been injured and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway  
     Houston thought that Boever would demand too much money so they let him
     go  Doug Jones can lose his touch  he went from Cleveland's allstar
     closer to the minors in a pretty short span

  From what I understand Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
                                      
club  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West 
No argument at all with Murphy  He scared the hell out of me when he came in
last year  On the other hand the club though enough of Boever to put him into
an awful lot of games he may have led the league in appearances  he did at
least at some point  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy  but I guess
that's not considered that crucial by the club  I can just remember two years
ago so well though

      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting
      on base  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finley's job  Biggio concerns me since he usually
      starts the season very strong

I'm not that concerned  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the
years and they have no good reasons to decline no injuries not old 
I expect them to come through just fine  It's those guys that have not
been consistently good that are the worrisome part even if they are coming
through right now
                                     

     On a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year's uniform  There is talk that their road uniform will be
blech traditional grey with the word HOUSTON written across the
chest  If I'm not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange shiver  McLane's favorite color is red so

This sounds like their old road unis  Pretty dull  Buttons or pullovers
I'll check through my uniform book to see if they've always had some orange

     I'm really upset the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible  I'd like to see the uniform of the mids return  They
may not have been pretty but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball  and I liked it

Well we'll see  I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the Astros stripes
across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public  i
can see why they might want that to change  Gee if they eliminate the
orange will they reupholster the seats in the Astros stripes section what
used to be the gold and yellow levels  I don't know those numbers they use
now

I saw a pinstripe version of an Astros cap and I actually thought it looked 
good

 Didn't Bob Horner go straight from Arizona State Univ
 to the Atlanta Braves I remember he had one great
 month hitting dingers and then the next I heard
 he was in Japan

 A month  Well he did have a short careercompared to what one might
 have expected for such a highly touted prospectdue to being injury prone
 overweight and having no work ethic  But he certainly did not
 suffer from being rushed to the bigs


Sorry Len this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs
Being overweight and having no work ethic leading to being injury prone with
nothing to loose might have been corrected in Richmond  Did you intend a 
smiley after your comment


If I remember correctly Which is always in doubt Horner's signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St for one more year if he hadn't
signed  Anyhow the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once
it lead to a weeklong walkout  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted and minor league play wouldn't have helped
But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML and it did
keep him there for a while until he started falling on his wrists

I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained
about the old ballyard place Sure it's been cold the food lines were long
and the hired hands were surly but this was all part of the Giants mystique
Or so I thought

I went to Tuesday's game    Giants over the Marlins and the 'Stick was 
a much different place Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind but 
everything is a lot better The lines are a lot shorter the bathrooms are
CLEAN and have running water and the hired hands were very polite 

The new foghorn lights up and blows after each homerun and the wooden fence
are very nice as are the new bleachers The bleachers start right at the top
of the fence and give a great view and they've got beer stands at the
bottome of the bleachers The only complaint is that the electronic 
oldfashioned scoreboard looks electronic  could be better

These things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real 
businessman ex  Safeway President Peter Magowan to figure it out Just 
like he used to tell his checkers If the customers don't come back I don't
need as many checkers This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie  he was a competent
businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public

I'll give an example of how the level of service has changed The onion 
dispenser jammed as I was using it An attendant came over apoligized for
the problem and proceeded to fix the machine After he was done he cleaned
the machine and said he was glad to be able to help In the old days there
was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say Go to
the stand  feet away  they might be able to help

All in all it was a fun day

 I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now TP
 rated Baerga higher actually

Finally an objective source  Alomar's a great player but so is Baerga
Nice to see the objective source cited rather than my dad's bigger than
your dad posts

I know  You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar
to Baerga must be a JayLover and IndianHater  Sorry you got that
one wrong  I hate the Jays and don't care one way or the other about
the Indians  But objectively Alomar had the better offensive year
last year so I have to pick him

You admit TP as a reliable objective source  Then you will note
that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player chosing Baerga
over Alomar only because of his defense

That's a joke  Alomar might not be a goldglover but he's certainly
no worse than Baerga defensively

I'm sure the company for which I work does not have all the same opinions

  The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury

still with the Twins in  and  but if you look at his stats both

I haven't been following the previous HR's  But there are two that I saw
live that would have to be up there up where there  
 Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 
It was hit off Steve Rogers who is a RHP and primarily a starter
Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP
Lee would have been a safe bet  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that
time or so he told me and around  others on a recent venture into 
Montreal  The blast wasn't the important aspect  It was the timing
Seventh game a tie game and in the top of the th  The Expos almost
came back though
 Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in   So close yet so
far
and
 Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago  It went off the technical ring in the Big O  It almost left
the stadium  That was hit HARD

I'm just not used to an overly enthusiastic Houston fan  I really shouldn't
discourage it so HANG IN THERE LUMBERJACK  But get ahold of that shift
key will ya
 
ObBase  Apparently the new owner Drayton McLain sp doesn't particularly
like excuses  An item in our paper the Austin AmericanStatesman  If you
read it here it was somewhere else first said that he wouldn't take 
injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been
accounted for  Uh oh  I don't want an owner that'll keep everybody on
edge  I'd never gotten that feeling about him but who knows  Does 


  To be honest I think the city of Houston loves the new owner  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions  players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros  I don't
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball
McLane is a businessman and doesn't like excuses  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club  Look at the depth of the
bench this season Canadele can play  positions Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too Uribe is nice to have as well  The
pitching staff has  legitimate starters  We're dealing with a young
Houston team so injuries shouldn't play a big role  The only threat is
the bullpen  if Jonesy goes out we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season there is less pressure on the pen

I remember one he hit circa  at Wrigley Field that went across
the street in dead center field and hit a house on the roof  He
whiffed a lot but when he did connect watch out

My favorite was the Barry Foote homer that bounced on Waveland and through
a second floor window across the street  Second though would be the Kong

 abberation from the norm than it seems
 
  I don't get a feeling that the weather has been an issue this year 
    There doesn't seem to be a really cold spell in North America which 
    does makes it harder to hit not to mention making the ball carry less

You obviously did not watch the Twins in Chicago

No cold spell  It's been snowing most of the week in Minnesota

 Not clear to me at all  I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
  games than  games  In the  game luck is going to play a much
 bigger role than in the  game 

But you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to
one run

Not if you've scored four runs you don't  Why strain even the best pitching
staff  Why not make it easier for them  

In the  game the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate
for a blown call a bad hop a gust of wind  Winning close is the 
wrong way to win both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot 
yourself are insurance against the Shit happens aspect of baseball

Not every great teamhas even good pitching  The Big Red Machine of
the 's was leagueaverage in pitching  But somehow RoseMorganBench

 I've recently been working on project to determine the greatest
 players at their respective postions  

 B  Career                         

What about U Johnny Hodapp the greatest nd baseman in Cleveland Indians
history   hits in  consistantly over   A great great second baseman

Um the header said career  Hodapp managed about  PA in his
nine years in the majors

As for his consistently over  make that three years in a row 
preceded by a parttime year plus his last year with Boston  Hodapp
only qualified for the batting title five times  

Was he injured  He retired right around his th birthday

Anyway Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year everybody put up
flashy numbers  That was his only really good year with a bat 
his other  years were marred by a lack of power and an inability
to draw walks  Only  of those  PA were bases on balls which
does not describe a feared hitter  

On the other hand he was part of the long line of famous Cleveland B
Wambsganss Riggs Stephenson etc

 I agree though I'd also be happy with a stadium that looks
 like new Comiskey The new park was also made for baseball
 Unlike Three Rivers the Vet Riverfront etc it's not a
 football park in which they also play baseball

While we're on the multipurpose subject let's not forget Shea which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets  Jets  It was the first
stadium I think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football

Not the first  RFK olim DC Stadium was built  years earlier
Nowadays they don't move the seats back for the few exhibition
games but the rdbaseLF lower deck used to move  It was all 
metal which was pretty noisy on Bat Day

Of course with the Jets gone to Jersey and a truly good football
stadium the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where
because it's circular the seats are almost always too far from the
action  The Mets announcersKiner  Murphy in particularhave
always hyped it as beautiful Shea
Stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is

It's vastly better than it was before they fixed it though  Back in
the late 's it was a dump

Roger don't youlike jet noise

     Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it
I

mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
as

is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell

Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
Eddie

Murray and Jeff Reardon

Um what  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a long time

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot  years and excellently
on several occasions  

Dave Kingman's best year was like Darryl Strawberry's typical
year with the Mets  

Darrell Evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which 
is all that Kong did  

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving

Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards
marginal

Whom are you talking about  Yes Eddie Murray is marginal but that's
because he's  years old  He wasn't marginal for a long time

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there They're both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal

Not  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you hadn't 
noticed

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder

     Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors
so

liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if

Like whom  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near
as goos as the guys you're running down

something
isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When

That's already the case by some standards  But the bad players in the 
Hall are all from the 's and 's  Recent picks have generally been
excellent

certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
candidates the absurdity is apparent Gee can these guys even compare to
the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

No but who cares  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth
Not really  But he obviously belongs there

The Hall has generally had about the top  of major leaguers  As 
more players come through the game more will be in that top   

And yes it's pretty easy to argue that Smith Yount Evans Winfield
etc are in the top   Dave Kingman on the other hand was a liability
throughout most of his career

Of course Garvey hasn't gotten a lot of HOF press so I don't know
what you mean  

As for Ryan is his WL better than Morris'  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at  And Morris was awfully good for a decade and doesn't
lead MLB history in walks allowed either

Just wondering  A friend and I were talking the other day and
we were for some reason trying to come up with names of Jewish
baseball players past and present  We weren't able to come up
with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
humor us  Thanks for your help

Stankiewicz  I doubt it

Koufax was one of two Jewish HOFs the other is Hank Greenberg

Other good players Buddy Myer Johnny Kling Norm and Larry Sherry
Ken Holtzman Saul Rogovin Ed Reulbach  

There have been over  Jewish major leaguers  A few years ago there
was an article about someone who keeps track of this in Spy magazine
the article was entitled Jews on First of course

There have also been at least two books on the subject

Which reminds me yet again of a BucsCards game in Whitey Herzog's
last year as Cards manager  Karen and I were watching the game on TV
and for some barely explicable reason the camera kept dwelling on The
White Rhino himself at his uniformfilling worst  Truly horrible

	Do you remember Game  of the  NLCS after the Dodgers defeated
the Mets and Ughadugh fooboo fat stomach Tom Lasorda came running out
on to the field in celebration  YUCK
	He undulated  His arms flew up and down keeping time with his
rolling set of  stomachs which flew all around the cozy confines of
Chavez Ravine  He oozed like a white gastropod  He ran  It was a 
disgusting sight  Not only couldn't I watch my Mets in the Series I had
to watch Fat Stomach Lasorda roll around Dodger
	BLARGH

But what made it memorable was what Karen eventually said about this
which was

I would rather sleep with a jar of Bill Landrum's spit under my pillow
 than look at Whitey Herzog in one of those uniforms

	If you like short fat men who grunt curse and spit a lot
Whitey's certainly your man  Former WFAN host Pete Franklin on The White
Rat 
	But it's true this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in
tight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary 
physique  Looking at Charlie Hough's scrawny torso through those tight
white shirts just sort of makes me decide Hmmm I don't want to eat lunch
todayor tomorrowor anytime soon
	When Al Harazin first became Mets' GM he was asked if he intended
to help redesign the Mets' uniforms and change their image  In particular
they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the 
sides the uniforms  He said that he's very much in favor of keeping them
because they're sleek and they're sexy
	Sid Fernandez in a tightfitting uniform with a sleek racing
stripe to denote speed and potencty  Mmmmmmmmlard
	Kevin McReynolds diving after a fly ball  MmmmmmmmMan O' War baby
	Pat Howellwell never mind  Nothing could be tight on him 
They don't make uniform sizes that small  

Adam Wishes he contribute something more interesting to rsb Levin

There's a blurb in the STATS Scoreboard about this and though I don't have

far below this  number

 Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
 attention spans ie the football crowd   Invariably all the
 arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on TV say the
 same thing  the games are too long and too boring  Baseball is trying
 to find a way to shorten the games for wider TV appeal  If you look at
 it though baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
 games  The difference is that there is more action in that duration in
 football games  Perhaps if there were more action in baseball games you
 would get more of those fans to tune in  Anyway coming up with a solution
 to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult
 On soapbox Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since it's obvious
 that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in
 Nebraska Off soapbox
 
 How can you say there is more action in Football then Baseball A Football
 Game consists of approximately  plays and the average duration of a play
 is around  seconds This means that in a Game that lasts approximately 
 hours you have about  minute s of action In a baseball game you have
 upwards of two hundred pitches There are very few on field strategy 
 on field stratgy sessions ie huddles and you always have a chance to win
 until the last out is made 
 
 

Ah but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and
a sense of urgency because of the game clock not all the time but it happens
when there's less than  minutes to go quite often  This sense creates
drama even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's
attention  In baseball only  players are involved in the action for about
here comes a wild guess  of the time  And they're just playing a
sophisticated game of catchholdtheballstepoutoftheboxadjustchains
touchselfininterestinglocations  There's a lot of dead time with the
players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the
mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher
who then takes   pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ Dodger fans
will appreciate that one  To the non baseball junkie this is boring
At any rate I'm not putting baseball down for this  I've been an avid
fan since I can remember  it's just that watching a baseball game on
TV at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie  That's what Major
League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of
shortening the game  It's because of TV not because football has more
action than baseball

Some evidence that is NOT working

Take a look at the standings It's REAL easy to get so focussed on 
minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place If it's
working you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things just because you think it
ought to be different

Some folks like to argue about theoretical details I prefer to watch teams
win When the Giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange
the batting order Until then I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong
for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS

PS  Does the mailing list maintainer think that Will Clark is the best 
first baseman in the majors and that Matt Williams is a better power hitter
than any other ballplayer

In the majors I don't follow AL so I won't comment on Majors In the NL
if I had my choice of any B in the league for my team it'd be Clark and
I'd hit him third My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it because
I've never been able to GET Clark I'd take any of the three without
hesitation in real life but I think Clark is it

Williams Not even close I much prefer his defense but when he isn't
headcasing it Matt has a good solid swing and some real punch If he drops
to  then he wanders out of cleanup but according to the latest
Baseball Weekly he's hitting  and in the last week hitting 
That's not exactly chopped liver

Mostly though the Giants are winning and frankly as long as that
continues it's rather silly to secondguess their strategy But evidently
some folks would rather be right than be first

I think Sac flies are the only way OBP can be below BA


Does this seem dumb to anyone else
The fact not the comment

Why should a batter's OBP be hurt by a sac fly  Especially if sac
bunts don't have the same effect since they do the same thing
but sac flies usually score a run while bunts just advance a base

But both of these situations involve the batter giving up an AB for
the benefit of the team sacrifice  So why should it hurt their
stats

The sac bunt is a purposeful act ordered by the manager  
The batter does not go up trying to get a sac fly and the
evidence available indicates that there is no such ability 
players can't will themselves to hit sac flies they fly out
to the same place just as often when there's nobody on third

Sorry I gotta disagree here  Last time I played ball I went up on

difficult with good breaking balls  A good hitter with excellent bat
control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least oh

You haven't been facing major league pitching      

  Maybe more you have to be good at the plate and most
of those guys are just as likely to opt for getting the base hit and
helping their average as getting the sacrifice  The best example I know
of is Jerry Willard in the  Series against Minnesota  All he had to
do was put one in the OF and the game was over  He swung waaaaaay past
parallel and accomplished barely getting the run in safely

STATS did a little study in the  Scoreboard book entitled Can
you hit sacrifice flies on purpose  A summary of the findings

Over the  year period sacfly type fly balls were produced 
percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful and 
 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful

They looked at the leaders in sac flies and found that the leaders
in sac flies  in other words the guys you would expect to be good
at it it  hit sac fly type fly balls only  more often when they
needed to  a difference way too small to be the result of a skill
Essentially the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do
so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often with and without
a runner on third

STATS concludes So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit
sacrifice flies on purpose  even if they practice in the bATTING
cage

with a  ERA  Deshaies allowed  Earned runs in   innings meaning
his ERA will climb slightly  Deshaies who came to MN via a trade with
Philadelphia which sent David West there continues to make Andy MacPhail
look like a true genius

Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins going  innings
on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting  Deshaies and Banks now 
combine for  of the Twins eight victories while TapaniMahomesErickson are


Wednesday's game marked the first opposing lefthanded starting pitcher for the
Twins this year Rickey Bones  The Twins teed off against both him and 
subsequent relief including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead
to   The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead though allowing
 walks in the th inning  of which scored and coming with bases loaded
Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved Guthrie two walks and Mike
Hartley one walk before the inning was over  This tied the game at  and
the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for  runs in the top of the tenth to win
it

Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew   of  career blown
saves have come against the Brew Crew and today's game was shaky as well
Coming into the ninth with a  lead Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn
then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the
side  Once again the tying run made it to second base on Aggie
Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth

General News

Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder playing in left field on
Tuesday's game  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching
though which has limited his playing time  Gene Larkin and JT Bruettformer
Gopher have been playing right field as both can bat left handed

The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow  Starting
Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson Mahomes Banks  The Detroit
Tigers have had TWO  run games in the last ten days and should provide 
quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff

The Twins have  HR's this year three each from Puckett Hrbek and Winfield
the third fourth and fifth batters respectively

Brian Harper pegged  of the first  baserunners attempting to steal second
this year and shows much improvement in this category

Jim Deshaies has three pickoffs and one balk this year  Some say he 
has the best st base move in baseball  This move has enabled him to pitch
out of some tight early jams and has certainly contributed to his  
start  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly
in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the
rubber on the pickoff move

Some folks like to argue about theoretical details I prefer to watch teams
win When the Giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange
the batting order Until then I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong
for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS

This is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division
But the Giants are going to need every break they can get if they
want too hold that lead  I don't think they can afford to be
lackadaisical and say well it has worked pretty well so far and
while we might be able to improve the results we don't think it is
worth the risk

Mostly though the Giants are winning and frankly as long as that
continues it's rather silly to secondguess their strategy But evidently
some folks would rather be right than be first

The two tend to go hand in hand

Dan

Nolan Ryan qualifies on both counts I would guess that Viola is the
other one who has beaten and also lost to every team in the majors

	Viola has only played in the NL with the Mets  not possible for him
to have defeated or lost to every team  Ditto for Tanana who was mentioned
in a previous post

The rd pitcher to lose to every team is probably Tom Seaver but
it could be Koosman

	I don't remember if Seaver managed to get a win against the White Sox
in his brief sojourn with Boston so I'd say the other pitcher to defeat every
team is either Mike Torrez he bounced around enough for a long enough period
of time or Koosman as mentioned  I would also guess that if one of these
two did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team

One funny story is that during Spring Training the Braves played a game in Mexico  This game was broadcast back to Atlanta in Spanish  It took the broadcasters a few innings to get a rythm going because they had to keep changing their location  Seems it took a while to find a place where they could get a clear signal on their cellular phones through which they were calling the game

    Besides Wade just doesn't have any range  What a shame about
    Charlie Hayes huh
Who would you have playing B Wade Boggs or Charlie Hayes  My choice
is Boggs  No contest  It will give them time to develop younger talent
in an area the Yankee farm system seems to be deficient

Ahem Two words Russell Davis Playing in the cavern at Albany AA last
year  down the alleys and to center Davis went 
with  homers There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern
League either He's  and his MLE was   HR I have no
fielding statistics but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say
that he's not Brooks Robinson but neither is he Howard Johnson Unless they
think they can win the pennant this year which seems possible and need
Boggs to do it I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis
that Boston made with Boggs leaving him in the minors for two or three
years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter

  Spike Owen

Too bad they gave up on Randy Valarde  Too many trips on the Columbus
Shuttle

Hrm They still have him on the roster  AB through the first two weeks
They've just never figured out what to do with him I suspect that he hits
enough especially vs lefties to be a reasonable shortstop One rumor
running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert
Silvestri to be a catcher because his body type was wrong for a
shortstop  You'd think that somebody in the same division who plays
Baltimore about a dozen times a year would know better

 Just watch me Mattingly is a below average fielder 

 Before you start up yes I have proof There are really only two
 adequate ways to measure fielding prowess the first which has the
 advantage of being applicable to older players since it uses raw data
 available for almost all of MLB history is the Total Chances per Game
 method favored by the Total Baseball people among others It basically
 says that you measure a fielder by how many balls he gets to 

But it is subject to all kinds of bias and is almost completely useless
for first basemen  From the raw stats there is no way to tell which of
a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders and
which were made on his own plays likewise you can't tell whether a
double play was  or   Fielding Runs thus gives a first
baseman no credit for putouts or double plays only for assists and
errors  

It thus favors first basemen who play deep reaching a lot of balls but
forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently  It also hurts first
baseman who play behind lefthanded pitching staffs and thus face few
lefthanded batters

 A better method but newer and based ondata that has only been collected
 over the last few years measures the percentage of balls hit into the
 part of the field the guy is responsible for 

This is better of course it still isn't all of a first baseman's
defense

 Some references Mattingly's  defensive rating STATS method from
 Mike Gimbel's Baseball Player and Team Ratings 

Defensive Average which uses larger and probably better zones has
Mattingly tied for second in the league

 On the other hand he has contributed  runs by his batting
 actions a pretty healthy number 

While  batting runs is good it is mostly in the past the runs he
produced in  don't say much about his value in

In a game that saw a little of everythingincredible defense some power
clutch pitching and a little wildnessthe Reds managed to overcome their
trademark lack of timely hitting in crucial situations

 During spring training I made a similarly innoncentlooking comment 
 about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying  no such
 thing as clutch hitting they the SDCN's all screamed  I assumed
 they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance
 given their comments  

This is certainly not the case  There is no significant ability toi
perform in the clutch but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a gamewinning hit  The clutch pitching quoted above is
something which happened not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher

 Over the past four seasons Sabo has had  hits in  abs defined as
 clutch situations by The Scouting Report for an average of 
 Over that same period he had another  abs with  hits for an
 average of 

 According to the rest of the SDCN's any differential such as this is
 completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable
 inference such as perhaps Perez should have used a pinch hitter in
 that situation

Simple statistics tell me that there is a  chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split the average decrease is  points
standard deviation about   There will be such hitters in any league
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays

And there is only a very weak correlation  in my best study between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability  Based only on this data I don't see any reason to
pinchhit for Sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinchhit
Does the pinchhitter give you a platoon advantage  Any portion of
Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves

 	Ideally DHs should be the strongest offensive players because
 any schmoe can play DH if he can hit  That would take care of position
 corrected anomolies such as Frank's  Since that is not the case and why
 not  Is it always this way then we are going to have trouble finding the
 true value of DHs using the same models as that for position players

There are several reasons for this difference  The main reason is that
good hitters in their prime such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull
are rarely regular DH's even if they can't field it's more commonly a
place to put aging veterans

Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury
slowly getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the
field  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did
during the rest of the season

A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first
or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason  Reggie
Jackson was a good example in five years as a RFDH for the Angels he
hit like the old Reggie when he was in right

The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by
their primary position only a player who plays  games in right and 
at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages

 	A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement
 value if you can find it for B or LF or something  We can assume that
 if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value even though I
 doubt this is actually true for players like Winfield and Molitor  This
 would let us discount the time they spend playing DH because that
 forces the team to find another real fielder to play

This makes sense you might also look at it another way  Although the
average offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left
fielder the replacementlevel offensive performance is certainly
lower if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job
anywhere then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH

Sigh  Here we go again                     

Actually several SCDN's stated that there were no definable skills
that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch
situations vs nonclutch situations however one might choose to
define clutch

Right  Can YOU define such a skill

Must I  If I were to say that batting average is a predictor that 
can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a
hit on a particular plate appearance is that only valid if I can
define the skill in hitting a baseball  That's all I've said 
except I used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations

And elsewhere on this thread Sherri Nichols repeats her position
that batting average in clutch situations is a meaningless statistic

For predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  At least
if it has meaning we don't know how to find it

I did not say I could predict the future  I've suggested that the
statistic is not necessarily meaningless  Here's the data for this
situation

		NonClutch			Clutch	 
		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA

Sabo								
Samuel									


If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time I assume you
would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting Samuel  I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance  You just wouldn't have used this particular
aspect of prior performance  Is this not correct


I'll try to avoid being insulting  But it's difficult when you so
cavalierly dismiss hundreds of hours of work with an I don't pretend
to understand but

NOBODY IS DENYING that there are people who have hit well in the
clutch in the past  But I challenge you to find a method to predict
who will hit well in the clutch in the future  Which after all is
what you are claiming you can do  Since


One more time  I did not claim to be able to predict the future
I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would
have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo

And I am not dismissing your work  I'm stating my opinion
You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work


Fine  We have plenty of data  Obviously our preconceived biases must
be coloring our work since you know clutch hitting is a
welldefined and consistent skill all of our failures
notwithstanding  So I challenge you to PROVE IT  I guarantee you
that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability
you will have plenty of happy SDCNs dancing around you

I did not say that clutchhitting is well defined

	I said that the data is significant  to me

I did not say that it is a consistent skill

	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
	certain set of circumstances
	

But you aren't going to win any support by merely stating a position
and claiming 'they are stupid so I must be right'


And big sigh


I have NOT

is a stupid argument and you know it

Ah  I knew we could get to the name calling  And there's that word
you like so much

works we can then attempt to apply it to  and beyond

Wait a minute  I thought I first had to define clutch hitting
Do I or don't I

You have made strong statements  Now back them up or be proven a
total idiot

I made two statements in my post

	I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting

	I would have hit for Sabo


As for  many of us make a number of written statements through 
this media about what we think will happen in baseball  I'm not
shy about it  I'll make the statement again  I believe that by
season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I can't prove that it will happen so I guess we'll 
just have to wait and see


                                  
Here's another one for you  In    Joe Carter's batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in nonclutch situations each year  I presume you think
this is random  

NonClutch	 AB		 H		
Clutch		  AB		  H		

So what could we expect in  from Mr Carter

Well his composite BA through  was   through  was
  through  was  so I think we have a pretty good
idea of what kind of batting average he can produce  In 
he hit   Not surprising huh  Also in  

NonClutch	  AB		 H		
Clutch		   AB		  H		

No this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 
major league ballplayers  It just makes me think that in 
Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in nonclutch situations
                                 
 
As for  above I have plenty of company  John Dewan of STATSINC is
the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding
clutch hitting are compiled reported and referenced in the text
Bill James makes numerous references to a player's ability to hit
well in the clutch  I am not saying that I can predict the future
any more than they are   You and others are saying that your
work renders their statements and mine meaningless  I don't 
accept that which in your words proves that I am a total idiot


Stupid  Total idiot

Like Clinton and Reno I accept full responsibility for this
senseless disaster  My wife and I picked this game to go to
and thus caused the return of the preseasonprojected Sox
offense  Like all nono's Bosio was good lucky hard grounder
by Vaughn off T Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who 
threw to Bosio at first  and backed by good defense
many nontrivial groundouts  The game was amazingly fast
as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also 
working fast  The Sox relief pitching was ok  the runs off
Quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single
which Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch

Greenwell's mental stability is a serious concern I guess it
has always been but his quirks were amusing back when he was
an MVP candidate  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a
after striking out on a bad inside pitch apparently Johnson
made an ok I've got to stay focused gesture which Iron Mike
interpreted as taunting and struck out to heavy booing the 
next two times  As Valentine noted last night he came up in
the first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game
Can you say take the first pitch  Not Mike who dribbled it
into a   The PI quoted Bosio that this was a batting
practice fastball  Next time up he also hit the first pitch
a hard liner straight to KGJr in center  He also made the
pathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR which looked 
comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight
reel that night

Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively  I couldn't tell from
the field angle but his range looked bad and he coughed a DP
that cost a run or two  Why was he leadoff  I hope Fletcher
gets well soon

Also on lineups Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond
me  It seemed to work as he was  with a HR and some good
defense a wag behind us said He sure don't want to go back to
Calgary  There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth
because they'll likely lead off the second as Boone did

Well now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in
Langston  A reminder that contest entries are open through next
Wednesday  I expect a surge of pessimism  By the way ties will
be broken by earliest entry  One entry per person or pseudonym
please and easy on the pseudonyms

Can anyone out there tell me why they call lefthanded pitchers

I dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums the batter faces northeast and so when
a pitcher is on the mound his left arm is to the south hence the term

Southpaw

Also the story on how the term originated

Thanks 


Go Cubs

Winfield can't touch Frank Robinson or Mel Ott as far as I can tell  
You'd also have a hard time convincing me to rate him better than or
equal to Clemente  

Two sets of numbers career equivalent average and equivalent runs

 Ruth      
 Aaron     
 Ott       
 Robinson  

 Clemente  
 Winfield  

Ruth is in a class by himself for both rate eqa and total eqr
performance Aaron runs over everybody in the total category Ott and
Robinson who lead Winfield in both categories could be safely put
ahead of ahead of him Reggie too although he is barely ahead These
numbers are normalized for league and park Clemente is held down by
some really anemic offensive production in his earliest years and was
still productive when he died it is reasonably safe to assume he had
 runs more he could have gotten Still Jackson Waner
Clemente and Winfield form a pretty tight knot


Yes but

	a we were talking about peak level not career averages
and
	b Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time as far
	    as anyone can tell

I did a quick scan last night looking for players with a peak comparable
to or better than Winfield  In my quickndirty subjective judgement you
could make good cases for Ruth Aaron Ott Robinson Clemente Kaline 
Maris Klein Jackson Waner and probably a few others  This is not a
knock on Winfield but a comment on his consistency all of those other
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches while Winfield has
been more uniformly excellent  Hall of Fame  Absolutely  Top peak
I'm not so sure  Top  total career value  Yes almost certainly

I watched the final inning of Bosio's nohitter with several people at
work After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he
wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out Yet the throw beat Riles
by about two steps I wonder how many others who watched the final out
think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand
Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded And
if he failed to field it cleanly would it or should it have been an
error or a hit Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced
past him he must have thought it would go through for a hit Whether
Vizquel was right or wrong he certainly made one hell of a play

 But it is subject to all kinds of bias and is almost completely

 for first basemen  From the raw stats there is no way to tell  
which of
 a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders

 which were made on his own plays likewise you can't tell whether  
a
 double play was  or   Fielding Runs thus gives a first
 baseman no credit for putouts or double plays only for assists and
 errors  

But ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way Range is
not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman The ability
to field all sorts of balls thrown to him digging some out of the
dirt stretching for others and so forth is important Thus 
putouts do provide some information  Maybe what we need is a
comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the
first baseman vs how many he actually got

Oh yea and Chris Bosio pitched a NOHITTER  One over the minimum two
bases on ball in the first inning one runner left  pitches  I listened
to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a
real treat as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite I doubt if anyone is
better than Niehaus  but that Fairly guy is really annoying me

But I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching it would have 
been a different story 

Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest best hitting team in
Major League baseball   Pretty impressive in any league

Man if Johnson Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a 
really interesting team to follow this year  Also John Cummings rookie
has had three solid outings with no support  If Fleming comes back 
this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year
relief is another story though  grimace

Too cool  The first nohitter that I have been able to follow from 
start to end  And again I think Niehaus will win some kind of award
for the way he called the game  The guy is truly a joy to listen to 
he deserves a pennant race

I've been a Braves fan for as long as I've been watching baseball almost 
years now  I say that just tp preface what I'm about to post

This Braves team is made up of slow starters  People are amazed that the
Braves aren't hitting  Don't be  They weren't hitting last year at this
time nor were they the year before  They had slow Aprils and Mays in the
 and  seasons  and yet they still managed to go to the Series in
those years  Well this team is no different so why should we be suprised
at their slow start  They started that way for the past two years and
they'll be that way until the Richmond club makes it to the majors  Judge
their offense in June or July when things start to average out  I'm just
happy that the Reds have gotten off to such a poor start  The Giants always
do well in the early part of the season but they'll be out of the race by
July just like the last few years  Unless Bond's developes a knuckelball
their staff will get rocked by midJune  

Wow You really know how to hurt a guy Guess I shouldn't bother watching
any more games It's already been decided

 I don't pretend to understand
statistical analysis

Well we agree on the last part 

Cool  And thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly
namecalling of others  


 One of the basic things you need to 
have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year  A 
player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year

OK

the basic problems with something like clutch batting average  overall
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero 
Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much

Actually I think the largescale sample size is part of the problem
It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to BA vs Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve  The Xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting
vs nonclutch  the Yaxis being the number of players  Certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  My
supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently
year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players
as opposed to all baseball players

  As a counterexample to 
what you showed consider the following two players from 

               NonClutch                      Clutch
               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA
 
Maldonado                                      
Lemon                                          

If you had had these two players in  by your logic in those clutch
situations you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye  Well in 
 Maldonado hit  in nonclutch and  in clutch while Lemon
hit  in nonclutch and  in clutch  Before you accuse me of 
completely cooking the data

You won't hear those kind of accusations from me  It is interesting
that you selected Maldonado because he is someone whom I have also 
looked at  He has been a very inconsistent hitter in terms of BA
hitting in            Admittedly he has
been traded between leagues as well as clubs  His clutch hitting 
record is equally inconsistent  So for my purposes in  I would
not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based
on his prior performance  I don't know how I would have felt in 
but you may indeed be right  

When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting and
a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately
below his nonclutch BA  Ditto for Joe Carter

This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having
with others on this topic  Must any conclusion based on statistical
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before
it has any validity  Is it impossible or irrational to apply
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base


BTW correlating players' overall batting average from '' with
' gives a correlation coefficient of  which is significant at
something better than the  confidence level  Correlating their
clutchnonclutch BA for the same period gives a correlation of 
 significant at no level of any interest

I completely accept that reasoning  Again what if we were to find
the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent
basis 

Actually it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future
clutch performance  It's more correct to say that we can't predict
future clutch performance with any skill

amen

Sigh  Here we go again                     

You started it

For predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  At least
if it has meaning we don't know how to find it

I did not say I could predict the future

You most certainly did

		NonClutch			Clutch	 
		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA
Sabo								
Samuel									

Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel  Yet you would pinchhit
Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and
Sabo will be a choke hitter  Right  I'd call that predicting the
future

If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time I assume you
would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting Samuel  I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance  You just wouldn't have used this particular
aspect of prior performance  Is this not correct

Right  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past  Overall performance LR splits
even matching hittingpitching styles  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly

EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance  And in this case everything else
pointed to Sabo

One more time  I did not claim to be able to predict the future
I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would
have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo

That comes down to the same thing  When Perez left Sabo in he
was predicting the future the next AB  He was predicting that
Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel

By supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite

And I am not dismissing your work  I'm stating my opinion
You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work

Well yes  You are aware of its existance  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it though I suspect you are simply unwilling  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite  You don't seem to think the
work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important
I'd say this is insulting

I did not say that it is a consistent skill

	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
	certain set of circumstances

RIGHT  This is the beef  It has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under any circumstances  At least none that
we've been able to come up with  If you know of some where it is an
indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret

It is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility
that you actually could have some preconceived biases

Most certainly  As I have repeatedly stated if you can come up with
a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability I would
love it  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have
all failed miserably

Yeah  Hindsight is always   Doesn't that make you bright  This
is a stupid argument and you know it

Ah  I knew we could get to the name calling  And there's that word
you like so much

Well it was a stupid argument  Are you honestly debating that
Sure we know Sabo didn't get a hit  We have no idea whether Samuel
would have done any better or not  One AB most certainly doesn't
prove anything

I believe that by
season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I can't prove that it will happen so I guess we'll 
just have to wait and see

Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year  Or is this
a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit
xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall

If you mean the first then as you say we'll just have to wait and
see  But the second is a much stronger statement  In fact it
suggests a rule  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years  I think you will agree that if the rule
didn't work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do
any better this year  Right

Here's another one for you  In    Joe Carter's batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in nonclutch situations each year  I presume you think
this is random  

I'm not going to get into case analysis  Sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '' and then hit poorly in ' as well  You
can also find those who hit poorly from '' and then hit well in
'

No this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 
major league ballplayers  It just makes me think that in 
Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in nonclutch situations

Gambler's fallacy  Unless there is reason to expect consistency a
run proves nothing  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next  I've seen a detailed study of
why I shouldn't expect it to correlate

Stupid  Total idiot  

My my  Such hostility

The stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  And
I don't see how you can deny it  As for total idiot  Yes  If you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong I would say the term fits nicely

So tell me  Does the term fit  Or do you have an open mind

Keywords Mattingly Fielding GoodHands

In article CwzoxLeskimocom steveteskimocom Steven Thornton writes
stuff deleted
Mattingly scores badly on both counts He doesn't get to very many
balls and he lets a lot of balls go through The fact that he looks
smooth has great hands and makes few errors means NOTHING This is
traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be
misled Like a lot of bad fielders Mattingly actually makes himself
look better by not having any range He's nowhere near as bad as Steve
Garvey but that's not much of a compliment 

I agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific
argument  That has great hands means nothing  It seems to me that
a firstbaseman's defensive value is not entirely or even primarily
from his ability to field grounders or catch popups  How many such
chances does he get during a game  Many fewer than he gets chances
to catch throws from BSSB and P I mean the total of these is
much higher than GrounderPopup totals  This implies to me that there
is value in catching these throws well even if they are high uptheline
or in the dirt  Good Hands are needed for such plays and thus have
value  I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences
of these plays but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are
similar  It's just like you don't judge catcher's defense primarily
on how they field bunts and popups But not as marked I suppose

      after his first day period was up I read in the USA Today Sports

      wondering if that was new I thought he was just letting it heal
As of today's USA Today  John Wetteland should come off of the DL
tonight and possibly pitch in the series this weekend I forget who they play

      Another question Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now
      that Olin is gone I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to
      replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok Any information on

Derek Lilliquist is probably going to be the main closer but it will be kind

To all the Braves doubters

Don't worry  The bats will come alive and the Braves will come around
The pitching is solid and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries
to the starting rotation they'll continue to pitch well  Heck with
the five starters on the Braves rotation they could even sustain an
injury to one of the five I hope this doesn't happen though

The bats are there Pendleton will certainly bat over  Justice
is catching fire Bream Nixon Sanders Gant well there's too
much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer  Right now the
Cleveland Indians have  players batting over   But I certainly
wouldn't their seven for our respective seven though wouldn't the
Braves be something right now with their pitching and  players batting
over 

The bullpen well it IS suspect  But when the bats come alive the
guys in the bullpen will be of less concern

So anyway I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season  I'm
not saying the Braves have automatically won the division but I'm optim
istic about their season though it's awful painful to watch them at
times right now

Go Braves

Oh no I wasn't confused  I understood that it was your personal

games  The arguments which declare this need seem to hinge on
the assertion that long games bore people and otherwise discourage
them from going to the ballpark  I'd like to see if the increased

there is a problem and something should be done about it  If it

is they have optimistically only  good starting pitchers

Actually I think the largescale sample size is part of the problem
It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to BA vs Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve  The Xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting
vs nonclutch  the Yaxis being the number of players  Certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell

Right  Most definitely

My supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players
consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other
then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about
those players as opposed to all baseball players

This may be the root of the confusion

Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind  Note
that I am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the
question at hand

Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game  You pick a number from 
and win if that number is drawn  Suppose we have a large population
of people who play this game every week

In the first year of the game approximately  of the population
will win  or more times

In the second year of the game  of those time winners will again
be time winners

In the third year of the game  of those who won  or more times in
each of the first two years will win  again

Suppose I started with  people in my population  After three
years I have  people who have consistently in each of the last
three years won  or more the number of times expected

Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game
No  Because we know there is no skill involved  Nothing about these
consistent winners can influence their chances of winning  But
suppose we don't know whether or not there is a chance that skill
might be involved  Perhaps some of the people in our population are
psychic or something  How would we test this hypothesis

We can look for correlations in the population  Now most of the
population will show zero correlation  But our psychics should show a
high positive correlation even if they aren't very good psychics
they should still manage to win  or more times most years  Net
result  A small positive correlation over the entire population

This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having
with others on this topic  Must any conclusion based on statistical
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before
it has any validity  Is it impossible or irrational to apply
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base

Well zero correlation is zero correlation  You mention that Sabo has
hit poorly in the clutch over the last  years  But if we look at
the past we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse
as they are to remain consistent  The length of the streak doesn't
seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be
clutch or choke the next year  Is there any reason to expect this
streak to be different from past streaks

Now if it were true that  of all threeyear streaks remained true
to form then we might have something useful  But then we wouldn't
have zero correlation  Instead we have  of all threeyear streaks
remain true to form and  of all threeyear streaks reverse  You
look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more
likely to choke this year  But it would be equally valid to look at
those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to
be clutch this year since the probabilities are split  each
way

I completely accept that reasoning  Again what if we were to find
the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent
basis 

Then we would have something useful  And we would also have a
positive correlation  But for every individual that exhibits such a
pattern and holds true there is another who exhibits such a pattern
and then reverses

Summary let's talks stats and not stats

Note  I'm not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard
but as an independent sort of thread  I do actually quote some things
that Roger Meynard wrote but it might be better to think of this as
sampling his post in the hiphop sense because it fits in with what
I want to say

maynardramseycslaurentianca Roger Maynard writes
But the point is that the only decision making pro
cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re
lates to the teams  Not the individual players  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  And that
is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game

There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball
team and some people's conception of a biological organism  In the
biology context we would very likely read fitness for the score of
the game and organisms for teams  How we interpret players is
trickier but either organs or genes might seem reasonable
choices depending on what point we were trying to make  A genes
interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case 
but that would be a different and probably longer post

If however we take the organ view then our knowledge of biology
should make us pause before we start saying things like species X is
more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z  Given what we
know about the interdependence of organs we would often be suspicious
of such claims  But note that this type of argument is quite often
made when you map species X onto 'humans' and organ Z onto
'brain'  On the other hand some statements of this kind do seem
more reasonable than others as far as we can test them eg 'brain'
above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross
pathology particularly if species Y is a primate

Even when you make such statements you should be concerned with the
functioning of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ
might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another
Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial
in some third species  However if we are nonvitalists with any
kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism is
not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intriguing
process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are
potentially observable  Some of these processes might be localized to
particular organs while others may be distributed across multiple
organs  In a way this is just like a baseball team except that I
think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved
in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup  Sheer speculation  Impossible to ascertain

One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly
controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do  But of
course this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they
can and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the
absence of certainty  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation
but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens
has done better than another pitcher with those statistics as a
criteria then fine

In this cases we're seeing the word statistics means summary of
observed events where the events themselves can be viewed as the
output of some process and possibly inputs for other processes
Thus if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together
into the functioning organism data in the form of statistics might
give us a basis to test particular hypotheses

But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the
individual's contribution to winning the WS  because that is the only
measure of best that has any meaning in the context of baseball

This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again
Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment
you might be fit in one situation and not another  Moving to
baseball it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an
environment including all the other teams in the league  In at least
a nominal sense the division winners are the fittest teams in the
league in that they on average had better fitness scores than any
of their competing opponennts  But in a real sense there is a fairly
large random component in the performance of each team that is
difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors
intrinsic to or interesting for baseball  The same is true in
biology  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the
World Series in basebal  In the world series the random component
may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played
and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement
where they were originally successful  It might be fun to watch but
it's unclear what it all really means



Now just one more unrelated point

I have yet to see that any of you can predict a
WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon

On the other hand you have seen some of us who can predict the
outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of
teams to finishes and maybe some of us eg me who can do this
better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis
But this is probably only due to the fact that a game schedule
gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference
between the winners and the losers

Moreover you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World
Series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict
the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only
to reflect the wellknown home vs road effect on winning percentage

The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it  There is no new
knowledge being produced  

Since stats are summaries of events it's true that if you know the
events you can derive the stats  But if somebody is trying to
understand the process behind the stats then the stats produce new
knowledge and some of this might even be reliable repeatable and
useful  Speaking of which I should get back to producing knowledge
in a different field  That is of course if I can produce knowledge
even though I'm relying on stats to do it

TWINS UPDATE   Posted April    

Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins but of
the American League as well  Going into today's game Deshaies was 
with a  ERA  Deshaies allowed  Earned runs in   innings meaning
his ERA will climb slightly  Deshaies who came to MN via a trade with
Philadelphia which sent David West there continues to make Andy MacPhail
look like a true genius

Minor correction Hartley came in the West trade to Phily  Deshaies signed
as a free agent M over  years  He pitched for San Diego last year

I watched the final inning of Bosio's nohitter with several people at
work After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he
wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out Yet the throw beat Riles
by about two steps I wonder how many others who watched the final out
think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand

In this morning's paper or was it on the radio Vizquel was quoted as
saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
easily thrown out Riles that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
final play more memorable  Seems a litle cocky to me but he made it
work so he's entitled

Based only on this data I don't see any reason to
pinchhit for Sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinchhit
Does the pinchhitter give you a platoon advantage  Any portion of
Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves


Hey  What's this  We agree

No platoon advantage Sabo vs Samuel

Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters
	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with
	slow curves and change ups

Sabo has more power and a little bit of a better batting eye  Samuel
	is noted as an agressive freeswinger  Sabo has more homerun power

Both players started the game hitting below   

There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted
	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later  But the game
	was on the line and Samuel never did get in

Given all of this I don't see a lot to suggest pinchhitting nor do
I see anything to suggest no pinchhitting  There is of course the
clutchhitting information  But if that's useless

Then again  If it's not

  Wade Boggs
    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot  But his career is 
    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop
    a long term solution ie Hensley Muelins Russ Davis Velarde
    Besides Wade just doesn't have any range  What a shame about
    Charlie Hayes huh
Who would you have playing B Wade Boggs or Charlie Hayes  My choice
is Boggs  No contest  It will give them time to develop younger talent
in an area the Yankee farm system seems to be deficient
 
 Ahem Two words Russell Davis Playing in the cavern at Albany AA last
 year  down the alleys and to center Davis went 
 with  homers There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern
 League either He's  and his MLE was   HR I have no
 fielding statistics but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say
 that he's not Brooks Robinson but neither is he Howard Johnson Unless they
 think they can win the pennant this year which seems possible and need
 Boggs to do it I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis
 that Boston made with Boggs leaving him in the minors for two or three
 years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter
 
  Spike Owen
    See Wade Boggs  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri
    or whoever  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is
    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA  point  And these guys
    are on the down sides of their careers
Too bad they gave up on Randy Valarde  Too many trips on the Columbus
Shuttle
 
 Hrm They still have him on the roster  AB through the first two weeks
 They've just never figured out what to do with him I suspect that he hits
 enough especially vs lefties to be a reasonable shortstop One rumor
 running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert
 Silvestri to be a catcher because his body type was wrong for a
 shortstop  You'd think that somebody in the same division who plays
 Baltimore about a dozen times a year would know better

 If one of our guys went down I just doubled it No confusion there It
 didn't require a Rhodes Scholar If two of my teammates went down four of
 yours would I had to protect my guys
 	 Don Drysdale


In regard to Boggs  I'll relate a story about a Yankee fan at Fenway last year
for opening day  I was there to see them face Baltimore and couldn't help but
listen to the Boston fans talk about various players on the team  One guy was
totally obliterating Boggs how he sucks etc  I told him I was a Yankee
fan and I'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back  He
said a pile of sht  I know Boggs had some personal problems while playing for
Boston but come on he's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed
dimension to the Yanks  A solid hitter a decent fielder and more importantly
a teacher ask Pat Kelly  I think he's got a few good years left in his bat
and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the American League
East this year  Boston fans have no class  They'll probably boo him like
crazy his first time back in pinstripes and I hope he goes  for  and shuts
them up

          publicly humiliating his players
          knuckling under to his players wishes

I DID NOT WRITE THAT  In fact those statements were a rebuttal to
an earlier posting that I made and this was culled from my strong
rebuttal to those statements  PLEASE  Slander  Shame


There is a fine line between getting players' input and knuckling
under to players' demands  A manager much like a military officer
needs to have his her players' complete obedience and respect during
a game  After the game it's no big deal but when there is no time 
to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often
falls apart see Boston Red Sox ff    


after the game it's no big deal    After the employees leave
the workplace it doesn't matter what they say about the boss or the
company  Puhlease


Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like
demands  I suspect that a comment like I enjoy hitting fourth I'm
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if
it came from Strawberry  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying
I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best
in that role  Paraphrased by my memory and bias  That seems like
a fairly nonpetulant answer to what was almost certainly a question 
like How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order


First it's Ross Porter  Second I am really tired of seeing the kind
of response that indicates that all I do is parrot what some media
person says or writes  I have a brain  If I choose to characterize
something in a certain fashion it's because that is what I believe
to be accurate  It is not just because some unnamed mediot made
the characterization  

A more mediasensitive player might answer The manager knows what he is
doing  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team then I
am all for it  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a
little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant

I did not brand Darryl's response as petulant because I never heard
any response from Darryl  I did call him a name  I referred to him 
as a primadonna  Someone else concluded that I did that because I
hate him  I don't hate him  I think he's a primadonna  If you
disagree fine  But stop putting words in my mouth

 Well it's just studying tape frame by frame  That's all  The biggest
 thing that you notice however is how bastardized the strike zone has 
 become  Death to the umpires' union  The plate is   across
 not   Call the high strikes strikes and quit calling pitches 
 outside strikes  they're balls
 
  Speaking of this  wide strike zone

  I'd sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that 
  an overview shot of home plate is available  CBS had this during the
  WS or did I just dream it

  Then again playersmanagers must not be too upset with the current 
  wide strike zone

  Mark Pede





Wait a minute  If I read the rules right A stike is ANY portion of the ball 
over ANY portion of the plate


Given that the ball is    in diameter  This sez that the zone width
is        or    While this is still less than the  
number given  I can forgive any UMP for misjudging  on an object moving
at  to  miles per hour many times not in a straight line

I think the Umpires Union has a great grasp of the rules

Actually I think the largescale sample size is part of the problem
It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to BA vs Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve  The Xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting
vs nonclutch  the Yaxis being the number of players  Certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  My
supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently
year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players
as opposed to all baseball players

Let's be careful here  If players' performance was completely random
in ClutchNo Clutch then you would still expect some players to be
good in the clutch every year and some to be notsogood every year
With two years worth of data you'd have  of the players good each
year  bad each year and  would have one good and one bad year
We have  players for  years ''  Just flipping a coin you'd
expect  players to be good all  years and  to be bad every year
This is what we actually get

No of good years                        
Clutch performers                    
Coin flip random                   

Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years
of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process
leading to deviations from nonclutch performance was completely random
If there was anything to clutch hitting at least in this definition
that had any predictive capability you expect to see the number of
players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping
a coin  Further if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above
or below average in clutch situations say  standard deviation from 
the mean more than one year the random explanation still looks good
In the four years '' that I looked at the data from Elias there
were   players with a minimum of   at bats in clutch 
situations that were  sigma from the mean two different years  Of
those   players   of them changed sign between the two
years  In other words they were great clutch hitters one year and
really horrible the other year  If it was just a random process 
you'd expect those numbers to be    

Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period
of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 
proposed definition has looked like a random process with the 
caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage
that could be dragged out of the dataeg John Lowenstein 
probably never had a clutch AB against a lefthanded pitcher
but he might well have had some in blowouts so that there would
be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his 
platoon advantage  This is not a subject that has been glanced
at casually  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into 
studying it and every one of them with the exception of the
Elias study has been unable to find anything that would allow
you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better
than flipping a coin  Selfserving plug follows  some of the
flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth
coming SABR book The Perfect Game by Taylor Publishing  The
authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance so go bug
your local bookstores now and maybe I can get enough to take my
wife to dinner once

 	The subject line says it all What is the rule that qualifies
 a pitcher as making a save

IMHO this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by today's rules in all 
of baseball  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot 
pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least 
appear in the ondeck circle  Also the lead a pitcher enters with cannot 
excede three runs

I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 
determining winnerssaversetc  For instance a pitcher can come in in the 
ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in 
the next half inning and earn the win  Has this pitcher earned a win no 
way

I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his 
teammates rally to tie the score  Assume he came in to start the fourth 
and left after the eighth  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in 
the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win  The 
third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat 
satisfaction

who we may not even have liked as players but mourned for dying too young

Wiggins Alan

I believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died

But that's besides the point  I'm sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed  But they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions

Example  

How about Jose Canseco  He gets a couple of speeding tickets and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time

Uh he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car and smashing it
into a tree as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car And the 
speeding reported was over  mph reckless driving

Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year  Two years ago  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity etc  

Actually I hadn't heard about this thanks

Meanwhile Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton and I didn't
read any sportswriter complaining about that  They may have talked
about how bad it was for the Phillies but I NEVER read anywhere
criticism of Dykstra's character or Daulton's intelligence for that
matter based on this incident

I don't know what you were reading or watching but I sure saw a LOT about 
that and about Dykstra's poker games Most of the writing was along the lines
of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was and how he'd hurt the team by
wracking himself and the catcher up etc ESPN raised questions about his
judgement etc The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary
action wouldn't be taken against Dykstra and one article pointed out that if
Lenny wanted to kill himself there were ways that wouldn't endanger other
people's lives Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it
was etc

When I say black I mean USborn black people for the purposes of this
discussion  Hispanic players were in baseball before  and one 
team in the 's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did  

What about black hispanics

And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

Don't know  But remember this is the country that had special racial
			    
laws for one group and one group only blacks  Our national history 
 

Man you had better do some SERIOUS reading I really really doubt that you

Just wondering  A friend and I were talking the other day and
we were for some reason trying to come up with names of Jewish
baseball players past and present  We weren't able to come up
with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
humor us  Thanks for your help

Hank Greenberg would have to be the most famous because his Jewish
faith actually affected his play missing late season or was it world
series games because of Yom Kippur

The other Jewish HOF'er is Rod Carew who converted  

Did he ever really convert  He married a Jewish woman but I've never
heard him say he converted  Elliot Maddox on the other hand

Lowenstein is Jewish as well as Montana's only representative to the
major leagues

Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish  Between Stone
Koufax Ken Holtzman  might have the wrong pitcher I'm thinking of the
one who threw a nohitter in both the AL and NL and Big Ed Reulbach
that's quite a starting rotation  Moe Berg can catch  Harry Steinfeldt
the b in the TinkersEversChance infield

Yep Holtzman  Saul Rogovin won an ERA title in  or so before blowing out
the arm

Is Stanky Jewish  Or is that just a Dave Cohen kinda misinterpretation
Whatever doesn't look like he stuck around the majors too long

I'd be surprised  btw they may just be shopping Gallego around to
make room for AS

   Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
 on the team To a large extent If Frank Thomas hit first he'd lose a LOT
 of RBI's and anyways how many nd place hitters have you known to drive
 in  runs Doesn't happen that oftenvery unlikely with Devon White's
  OBP in front of you
I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once  I know someone
will correct me if I'm wrong  

RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  You
can talk about OBP and SLG all you want but the fact remains

	The team that scores more runs wins the game
	

Right  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited as long as the TEAM
gets more runs  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI but 
doesn't score them all himself who cares

Consider

Player A single
Player B grounder to short reaches on the force at nd
Player C Double B to rd
Player D Sac fly

B gets a run D gets an RBI  Are you sure they helped the team
more than A and C  Think hard now

Flame Away

As you wish

Mark Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident where he lost a homerun
and the fan caught it

 Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
 wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
 are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
 that are in the field of play  Was the fan wrong  Should he have
 been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
 of interference 

Yes I think he should have done more to get out of the way  As much
as fans want to catch a ball they really should be aware that winning
the game is more important  As a Dodger fan he has to be aware that
this is the home stadium and that entails helping the home team win
in any way possible  As soon as the ball was hit that far his first
instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it not to try to catch
it himself particularly when he is sitting that close

I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans where they are against 
visiting team home runs so much they actually throw them back on the
field

Now this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or
not  Sure he probably screwed up but the fan should realize his
first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win

I've been following the Giants closely over the offseason  newspapers
notesgroup etc  but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year Barry's swing was 
very impressive  he's very quick and his swing seems effortless even
compared to Clark particularly Clark as of late

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits b b hr for  rbi's

     The Giants always hit Maddux well but it was interesting that Maddux
did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night  He threw  straight
fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the st last night got away with the
first one but Bonds hit the second one out of the park  Then in the rd
when Clark was at third base with one out Maddux did not intentionally
walk Bonds and Bonds dropped a single to leftcenter


The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better  Clayton's defense has been superb
McGee seems to like leading off this year  Manwaring is driving the ball
So on  so forth

     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has
not scored a run yet  He will always hit around  but I'm concerning
about his onbase percentage  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams he
has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base


I hope it continuesI think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching

     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL  Burba
has done a superb job filling in so far he looks like a different pitcher
from last year  However Swift is terrible in both of his starts  With
Burba moving into the rotation Mike Jackson is the only righthanded
reliever aside from Rod Beck he'll get a lot of actions  I also hope that
Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig especially on Beck
I was concerned when Beck was used for  straight days earlier this week


For myself I think the fresh start of MagowanBakeretc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year

     So far so good

        Spanky is too slow  If he were quicker he would still be here
 But with Slaught and Tom Prince they didn't want to lose Prince in order
 to bring up that th pitcher  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
 Prince is coming along nicely
 
 Tom Prince is a  year old nohit catcher  Think of him as a young Dann
 Bilardello  

Or a young Don Bordello

 I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of
 losing this guy who's been in AAA most of the last  seasons  The Pirates
 released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options then
 eventually sent Prince down anyway and he cleared waivers without a peep
 He's another year older and still can't hit why do they think he wouldn't
 clear waivers now  Why would they care

There's a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching  
prospects in the minors at this point  at least nobody ready for any serious  
AAAmajors duty  The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  
just age especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mids or something
 
All things considered though I'd be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  
the plate than Prince  Isn't there decent backup backstop out there looking  
for work

I'm sure all of you have heard of the extraordiary start by  rookie
JT Snow of the California Angeles  Other than the fact that his
father was a star receiver with the LA Rams and is now a radio
personality in Los Angeles and JT came from the Yankees organization
I don't know much about JT  If anyone has info and background on 
the young fenomplease post

By the way for those of you not following his exploits he has hit
four home runs in three days  Two last night  He has also delivered
the winning hit a couple of times for the Angeles in this young season

Thanks

To really speed up the game umps need to START CALLING STRIKES the way
they used to  I'm talking about making the strike zone start at the
knees and go up to the top of the letters  Forget this the strike zone
is in the general area of the groin  A lot less and counts and a
quicker game 

They tried that in the ''s and people stopped coming to the ballparks 
in droves as offense suffered immensely

They lowered the mound first before the  season  The shrinkage of
the strike zone didn't start until the mids

 Well you're absolutely completely dead wrong but thanks for playing
 As soon as I get to my office I'll be happy to post Rickey and Dave's
 career lines  Both are very fine players but Henderson has  
consistently
 been better
 
 As for Rickey 'slacking' due to his contract problems this year  any
 comments  Considering he's basically picked up the entire team and put
 them on his back I think he deserves a little slack and I think he
 deserves a year extension at M per year  Quickly
 




I was upset at people dissing winfield Henderson is the better player  
WINFIELD can come close though Lets see what rickey does for the rest of  
his career People forget how good winny was in the 's and also how

I don't actually have the answer to this one

Bosio after walking the first two batters retired straight for a
backend perfect game

How many other games  including extra inning games  have seen a pitcher
retire  straight excluding official perfect games

The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie
Shore game which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in
Cooperstown Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got
thrown out for arguing over the firstbatter walk Shore picked him off and
retired  straight after that

Just to add to this vein consider that range of a first baseman is not
the only important thing  He is IMO the best fielder of bad throws from
the other infielders  I have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt catch
balls off a large bounce take down balls over his head wide etc ad
infinitum  And he gets the out much of the time  Some of the things
he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing  You have to give
Mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot
near the bag yes I am sure he gets a few calls because he is Mattingly

The Marlins tried something like this and was a complete failure  On
Opening Day instead of having a thinning stretch with the singing of

the crowd into doing aerobics while the PA was playing Gloria Estefan's
Get On Your Feet  The fans actually booed and started singing Take Me
Out on their own  I actually kind of felt sorry for the girls

Are you kidding  I'm stuck with the Toronto SkyDome where their idea
of a th inning stretch is that Blue Jays song where everyone gets
to yell  Okay okay Blue Jays Blue Jays Let's Play Ball

Wow what genius did it take to compose that one to outshine the
old classic  And there are women on the field to lead the crowd

Then again this is the same crowd who is more entertained by the
grounds crew and the word ground is used loosely than it is by
the outstanding plays by the opponents' fielders

also  Then the dam broke  Wickander came in and promptly it was

Some evidence that is NOT working

Take a look at the standings It's REAL easy to get so focussed on 
minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place If it's
working you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things just because you think it
ought to be different

So that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays should keep Alfredo
Griffin just because it worked

A team winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is right
A team not winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is wrong or
otherwise to borrow the Sharks' situation you would say that George Kingston
should be fired

Some folks like to argue about theoretical details I prefer to watch teams
win When the Giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange
the batting order Until then I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong
for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS

By then it's too late  The problem with not fixing something while it's
working is that by then there may not be anything left to fix

Mostly though the Giants are winning and frankly as long as that
continues it's rather silly to secondguess their strategy But evidently
some folks would rather be right than be first

So the Blue Jays were simply perfect last year there was nothing that they
could have done to have improved that team  NOT

What's with John Franco  The Mets are hardly using him  I heard he was
completely recovered but now I'm not so sure

You must have heard wrong  His arm is still sore  He hasn't gone on the DL
but he may  Managmenet is treating him as a daytoday situation  

His doctors thought that he was ready and they had him throw in
Colorado but his arm wasn't up to the strain  He is throwing every day
but he's just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet

This is based on an interview that he gave on WFAN NY radio on Thursday

The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat looked I was also at
the Saturday game in Montreal Apr  that Rockies won  I haven't
paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance
seemed to be MUCH different He stands more erect and very open with his
left foot pointing to rd base I'm wondering if this is a recent change
in stance for him Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter He could
always be fooled by a curve ball low and away If this is indeed a new
stance for him maybe he is not being fooled as easily As for his patience

Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff If he was grooving
pitches to Andres you can hardly fault him for drilling them which he did
Does Andres generally start hot or cold Does it take until May for most
pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away

quoted for future reference
shown to be consistent in the past  Overall performance LR splits
even matching hittingpitching styles  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly

was predicting the future the next AB  He was predicting that
Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel

He believed one of two things  Sabo was more likely than Samuel
to get a hit OR  that more good would be done in the long run
by leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome

In fact you don't know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in

By supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite

In fact I don't think anyone is claiming that they can predict
the future or any particular future event  But we can believe
that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have
identified the cause and therefore will continue

And I am not dismissing your work  I'm stating my opinion
You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work
Well yes  You are aware of its existance  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it though I suspect you are simply unwilling  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite  You don't seem to think the
work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important
I'd say this is insulting

I think seeing insults in other people's opinions is kind of silly
After all Mark didn't call you a total idiot or call your work
stupid he simply stated that it didn't change his opinion on the 
subject

I did not say that it is a consistent skill
	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
	certain set of circumstances
RIGHT  This is the beef  It has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under any circumstances  At least none that
we've been able to come up with  If you know of some where it is an
indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret

If player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has and Mark believes
that it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next
season as well would you respond the same way  At some point you
might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows
what this guy does every Monday night  Maybe he sees his sports
shrink on Tuesday mornings or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights

But this is something that's true of one guy only  It doesn't
mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire
league by days of the week nor that there should be  But it doesn't
mean we can't make predictions based on that for that particular
player

I believe that by
season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I can't prove that it will happen so I guess we'll 
just have to wait and see

Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year  Or is this
a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit
xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall

I only see a prediction for one player here  I don't see anything
about ALL batters

Here's another one for you  In    Joe Carter's batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in nonclutch situations each year  I presume you think
this is random  
I'm not going to get into case analysis  Sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '' and then hit poorly in ' as well  You
can also find those who hit poorly from '' and then hit well in
'

That's exactly what Mark is trying to do though  Find hitters
that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions
for these hitters based on their past performance

major league ballplayers  It just makes me think that in 
Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in nonclutch situations
Gambler's fallacy  Unless there is reason to expect consistency a

Huh  What does gambler's fallacy have to do with anything
Whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you can't
deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that
you don't think it is likely to continue to exist because you
can't see a reason for it to exist

run proves nothing  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next  I've seen a detailed study of

Someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate
The argument along the lines of star player with LR splits will
always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game
ie opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to
face him where his manager will not pull him for a PH

I don't see how you can deny it  As for total idiot  Yes  If you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong I would say the term fits nicely
So tell me  Does the term fit  Or do you have an open mind

What about you  If the shoe fits will you wear it with an open mind

Yeah Morris just knows how to win That's why he lost  for Detroit in
 Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but
loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones And if rings was the only
criteria for success then teams would always tend to repeat and
eventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year Sort
of like the yanks in the s

Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good not great career
Toronto will finish rd or th this year with Morris and all those
rings because their pitching staff was destroyed over the offseason

Blame the Associated Press  After the official scorer balances the
official score card they copy it and give it to several diffent people 
One of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up using a
template on a laptop and transmit it to the AP offices in New York
Rockefeller Center via the telephone  The box scores are not checked
and just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services  If there are
corrections those are issued later  It is the person sitting in front
of a laptop at Shea or whereever whose fault that is  NOTE The AP
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in
most newspapers being the first one

Last week they were in Denver  Maybe the AP person in Denver did this
remember they just started with MLB out there  Check tomorrow's
paper  and see if the person who is doing it from Shea does the
same thing

While we're on the multipurpose subject let's not forget Shea which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets  Jets  It was the first
stadium I think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football

Minor point  Shea Stadium was designed as a multipurpose stadium but
not with the Jets in mind as the tennant  The New York Football Giants
had moved to Yankee Stadium from the Polo Grounds in  and was
having problem with stadium management the City did not own Yankee
Stadium until   The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea
When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the
new AFL franchise the New York Titans approached the City about using
the new stadium  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium where the
Cosmos played soccer in the s  Because Shea Stadium was tied into
the World's Fair anyway the city thought it would be a novel idea to
promote the new franchise and the World's Fair like they were doing
with the Mets  So the deal was worked out

Of course with the Jets gone to Jersey and a truly good football
stadium the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where
because it's circular the seats are almost always too far from the
action  The Mets announcersKiner  Murphy in particularhave
always hyped it as beautiful Shea
Stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is

I'm under the impression that when Murph says it he means it  As a
regular goer to Shea it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and
renovated the place  Remember this is its th Year

That exuberance disappeared immediately however when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and
just relocated him to another area  In an interview after the game
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning  LA Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch

Sounds like Darryl being Darryl Tommy spending too much time on
Slim Fast and needs a pasta fix and the media being their usual
charming selves  Sounds like a New Yorklike story to me  

I saw the replay and am wondering what the big deal is  I didn't
realize the folks in LA were making a big to do about it  I think
Stawberry Lasorda and the various media types should sit and watch
the replay then apologize to the fan

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of  rbi through the first
nine games

Darryl has not gotten off to a good start he has to blame someone

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan

As long as the fan doesn't interfere with the play I see no problems

   Another pair of suggestions
    Remove the Balk rule  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
      no matter what the pitcher does

Quite honestly this one is ridiculous  Consider the following
scenario Runner on third As the pitcher starts to throw home the
runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for
the suicide squeeze The pitcher seeing this does not throw home
but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down  It is the
balk rule that prevents this from happening  

Believe it or not this actually happened to me once in an OBA
Ontario Baseball association game in Milton Ontario  I was the
batter and to my amazement the umpire missed it  In the  years
that I played ball this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw

 the Blue Jays had such a strong offense  Don't tell me that Morris has this
 magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs
 

I don't know why you guys keep bickering about Morris The stats show he
is a mediocre pitcher at best this year is another case he just happened
to win  games I saw many of his games last year he did pitch some good
games But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense he was 
constantly giving up go ahead runs in the th innings the clutch innings
and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him Another major factor in
his  wins is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would
leave Morris in for ever therefore giving him many more chances to win
games i believe this is the major reason he won  games last year

he has stopped throwing the ball  Supposedly he had

First off Jeff has had like  hits in the last two games and walked
yet again  Sorry Ken but Jeff King does have some power which
means his SLG won't be below  and his walks are way up  If
that increase is real Jeff King will be an above average NL third
baseman in   Jose Lind on the other hand still doesn't walk
and clearly isn't a  hitter  My bet is that he won't be getting
any extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the Lind Shift
we were seeing in the NL

Any predictions as to when he is sent to Buffalo or released outright

No although since the Lavalliere weirdness nothing would really

Without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war I would like to
question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real
effect on his longterm performance  Sure if a man is tired and needs
real rest then taking a break might be a constructive act  Perhaps if
a man is mentally strained then sitting him down might help to the
extent that that helps him relax  But I would like to suggest that
in the long run players do slump and benching is probably irrelevant

 The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat looked I was also at
 the Saturday game in Montreal Apr  that Rockies won  I haven't
 paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance
 seemed to be MUCH different He stands more erect and very open with his
 left foot pointing to rd base I'm wondering if this is a recent change
 in stance for him Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter He could
 always be fooled by a curve ball low and away If this is indeed a new
 stance for him maybe he is not being fooled as easily

Yes the stance is new  Don Baylor was his batting coach at St Louis last
year and now as his manager is continuing to work with him  Maybe Andres
has a weak left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the
ball  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics  I dunno  But the
change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as  years ago  His
selectivity has not changed

Also I have the impression from reading this group and Bill James
that Elias is a bunch of moneygrubbing jerks whose mission is to
charge as much as they can for baseball statistical info


and bill james is not yeah  sure  do you own the bill james players
rating book

Uh Bill James doesn't sell statistics  He sells books with statistics
but he is not in the business of providing stats like Elias STATS
Howe Baseball workshop etc are

Greg

funny it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks
which are nothing BUT collections of statistics are authored by bill james
and stats inc and howe for the minor league handbook

and i am not sure how the  bill james player ratings book qualifies
as a book with statistics while the elias analyst is a statistics book
the analyst contains more stats sure but it also contains more dialogue

finally the point was not about the word statistics  it was about
moneygrubbing  i don't see how anyone who has looked at the bill
james player ratings book cannot consider him moneygrubbing

Subject bob vesterman's plan to generate fan interest
Lines 

the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a
large enough portion of the population and have suggested various
remedies such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that
smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation is an accurate description
of what is essentially a laidback game

forget those lame ideas  here is my new and exciting twopoint plan to
generate interest in baseball among the masses

point one sex
point two violence

let's face it sex and violence are the only things that sell in
america  here's how we can implement them in the game

sex cheerleaders cheerleaders and more cheerleaders  dancing on top
     of the dugouts  bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh
     inning stretch  running up and down the stands  the south bend
     white sox actually do this

violence baseball players are such utter wuss boys  the pitcher beans
     the batter and both benches empty in what is called a benchclearing
     brawl  EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER stand
     stand stand  look look look  ho hum  then the bullpens
     come running in  when they reach the fight they just stand
     there too

     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch
     should be suspended and fined  further the bullpens should fight
     it out in the outfield so as not to waste time and energy running
     to the infield

football sex violence
basketball sex violence
hockey violence
baseball da pastime of da nayshun  yawn

Yes  Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are
finally moving in the right direction  They should finish
over  this year and maybe even be in the pennent race
in August  However I would take back a few moves

  The Jim Abbott Trade

bleagh this was a terrific trade  snow will certainly be better than
mattingly in the future but that they'll be about the same now is a
defensible opinion  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in
the game today

  Wade Boggs

i'm not sure about this one  i think that it's good in that a
pre boggs kicks hayesmeulenswhoevers' ass and that a 
boggs still isn't ALL that shabby  it's bad though that the
yankees expect a pre boggs and will probably get a  boggs
however i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam

  Spike Owen

you have my full agreement here  he's not all that much better than
velarde and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him
however i do enjoy the fact that spike is not a nickname
not that this helps the yankees

  Danny Tartabull

i strongly disagree  i'd much much rather have a hundred games of
tartabull and sixty games of dion james than  games of james

 	The subject line says it all What is the rule that qualifies
 a pitcher as making a save
IMHO this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by today's rules in all 
of baseball  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot 
pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least 
appear in the ondeck circle  Also the lead a pitcher enters with cannot 
excede three runs

This is a phenomenon known around work as readyfireaim I am astounded at
the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only
don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding In fact there's a
plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins

For the record there are two ways that a reliever can get a save
He must finish the game and either
 have entered the game with the tying run on base at bat or on deck
 have pitched at least three innings effectively
A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game

I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 
determining winnerssaversetc  For instance a pitcher can come in in the 
ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in 
the next half inning and earn the win  Has this pitcher earned a win no 
way

But this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat not saves

I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his 
teammates rally to tie the score  Assume he came in to start the fourth 
and left after the eighth  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in 
the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win  The 
third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat 
satisfaction

This again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your
post

 	The subject line says it all What is the rule that qualifies

	As far as I know a save opportunity is when it is th inning or
beyond and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game
	For example If it is the bottom of the th inning and Clemens is
pithching The Red Sox are leading  and Clemens has just givin up a hit So
there is a man on first the batter and the batter on deck could tie the game
with a homer  If Jeff Russel came in The Red Sox reliever and finished the
game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score he would get the save
and Clemens would get the win                     
                                                Thats how I beleive it works

In any case on Winfield  Yes his career BA is a mere   He
didn't beat this until his sixth year in the majors and has only
topped it once since   His peak was in the early 's and

Just had to respond to the Bosox boasts ie Bosox win again 

See Red Sox fans can never do anything right in your mind huh  If we get
excited about the Sox winning you tell us it is going to be over soon  If
we worry that it'll be over soon you say that we are not true fans  i am a
Sox fan and I think after what ive been through being a Sox fan that Sox
fans are true fans  I am excited at what they are doing  So Greenwell
was horrible against Johnson who cares the Sox are   with all
nonDarwin starts what are the Mariners  I think the Sox have the best
record in Baseball still so they lost one darn

Johnson is a quality pitcher

And not the only quality Mariner pitcher  I logged on expecting to see
at least ONE congratulatory note for Chris Bosio's NO HITTER but nary
a peep  

So I'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now  and
slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games
or even a hit in last night's gem  

Not that we M's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers
of New England's longrunning tragedy but only one winning season in
history is something of a burden to bear  So we'll take our joys when
we can get 'em  

The Mariners now have two nohit pitchers on the staff and not
coincidentally those pitchers beat the Red Sox in back to back games

I heard he was completely recovered but now I'm not so sure

	He's recovered totally from his injury  That's why he's not
pitchingso he can rest his arm enough that he can get injured again
pitching on  days rest and then have fun dining in the Diamond Club in

For predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  At least
if it has meaning we don't know how to find it

I did not say I could predict the future

You most certainly did

I really don't want to get into a DidSoDidNot debate with you  But
this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement  I did not say 
nor did I imply that I could predict the future  You have inferred
that my comments meant this and you have based your rebuttal of my
comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that
there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in
regard to clutch hitting


Sabo								
Samuel									

Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel  Yet you would pinchhit
Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and
Sabo will be a choke hitter  Right  I'd call that predicting the
future

That is your opinion that Sabo is clearly a better hitter than
Samuel  The above data is for a year period ending last season
Last season Samuel batted  while Sabo hit  not park adjusted
This season they are both hitting below  albeit Sabo with more
at bats  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better
hitter than Samuel but I will also remind you that Samuel has been
a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo

I did not predict that Sabo would choke nor that Samuel would get a
hit  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager or
even a Reds fan that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that
situation than Sabo


If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time I assume you
would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting Samuel  I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance  You just wouldn't have used this particular
aspect of prior performance  Is this not correct

Right  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past  Overall performance LR splits
even matching hittingpitching styles  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly

Ah  properly  Yes  I see

EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance  And in this case everything else
pointed to Sabo

Please help me  What exactly is everything else that pointed to Sabo


Well yes  You are aware of its existance  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it though I suspect you are simply unwilling  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite  You don't seem to think the
work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important
I'd say this is insulting

I must say I was not aware of the publication  Can you email me the
information regarding its availability

And I guess I must apologize to all of those who have done extensive 
study on say supply side economics  I didn't mean to insult you
But I never did believe you were on the right path  I'm sorry for
my contrary opinionposition  I also regret that I don't have the
ability to prove that you are wrong  But you are
 

I believe that by
season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I can't prove that it will happen so I guess we'll 
just have to wait and see

Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year  Or is this
a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit
xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall

It is what it says it is

If you mean the first then as you say we'll just have to wait and
see  But the second is a much stronger statement  In fact it
suggests a rule  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years  I think you will agree that if the rule
didn't work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do
any better this year  Right


The second is your statement not mine


I'm not going to get into case analysis  Sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '' and then hit poorly in ' as well  You
can also find those who hit poorly from '' and then hit well in
'

Well actually I haven't yet  But I'm not finished looking
That is I haven't yet found someone who hit significantly below
his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 
   and then reversed that relationship in 


Gambler's fallacy  Unless there is reason to expect consistency a
run proves nothing  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next  I've seen a detailed study of
why I shouldn't expect it to correlate

Nope  Sorry  But if you were interested in a reason why I expect
Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one
year to the next I think I could  If you were interested in a
reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to
correlate from one year to the next I think I could  But you're
not interested in that because you think that those conclusions
could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire
baseball population  And they can't be


The stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  And
I don't see how you can deny it  As for total idiot  Yes  If you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong I would say the term fits nicely

The problem here is that I do believe you  I accept your work
I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based
on prior clutch history is meaningless  No better than a coin toss
I actually do accept your work

As it happens I also have an opinion that in certain situations
for certain players a history of superior or inferior ability to
hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be
valid in projecting future player performance  For that player
And Chris Sabo is one such player


So tell me  Does the term fit  Or do you have an open mind

Well since I defer to your statistical wisdom I think I must have
an open mind  Now we have to pose the same question to you

My supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players
consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other
then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about
those players as opposed to all baseball players

This may be the root of the confusion

Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind  Note
that I am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the
question at hand

Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game

detailed explanation deleted


Indeed you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement To 
rebut my opinion you have made an analogy with a game of chance
Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on
the selection of the numbers and hence their ability to win

Well that's certainly true in Lotto  But it has absolutely
NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball  When you start down
the wrong path you finish down the wrong path





I repeat  I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch
hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting
performance

I do however think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance
may for some players indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed
will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance
And I think Chris Sabo is such a player

For most career K's with one team if it's not Ryan perhaps Steve Carlton

 I'd have to say the most impressive HRs I've ever see came from Dave Kingman

 I remember one he hit circa  at Wrigley Field that went across
 the street in dead center field and hit a house on the roof  He
 whiffed a lot but when he did connect watch out

the best home run i have ever seen came off believe it or not
Roger Clemens sorry Val a couple of years ago he threw a ball to
Incaviglia which was literally at Inky's neck and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it after the swing Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ballhe didn't even turn around to look or
even get upset the ball hit the lights in the leftfield standard
some  or so feet about the Green Monster over  feet above the
ground total

truly an amazing shot

	Amazingly pitchers no matter how good their mechanics are
not machines  Cy Young winners don't pitch in a vaccuum unaware
of how their offenses are doing

	The Braves' pitching staff is already showing signs of
cracking under the strain of knowing they're not going to get many
if any runs  Unfortunately the Braves' pitchers were so bad for so
long that the organization put so much stress and I mean stress
on pitching that they completely ignored hitting

	The Braves right now are looking woefully similar to the Braves of
the midseventies  Heaven help us

	The term stopper is generally used to refer to a pitcher one
who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going
on a losing streak

	The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description
although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle

	What the Braves lack however is an offensive stopper
somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump
There's just no one there  The Braves got rid of their best pure
hitter Lonnie Smith and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster
has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit	

	Oh and another thing that worries me  Ron Gant seems to have
slowed down a step  That's scary  A slow Ron Gant doesn't have much going
for him

  What is the maximum runs allowed before a stopper can get credit for a
  relief ie if a stopper comes in with a  run lead does he getcredit
   with the save
  If you come in and pitch the last three inningsand your team was ahead 
  when you got out there and wins the game you get a save
  Sort'a correct If you pitched at least  inningsentered with your team 
  in the lead was the pitcher when the game endedthe game was never tied 
  during your stint and your team won you get a save
 Well the rulebook says that in the opinion of the scorer you must have
 pitched effectively for your  innings  this save is not automatic
 unlike the others

Someone in SABR actually looked at these games a few years ago 
and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one 
of the games  even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly 
allowing  or  runs

Right  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited as long as the TEAM
gets more runs  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI but 
doesn't score them all himself who cares

Amusing isn't it  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is
a team game combining efforts from every player for the win

Consider the Red Sox game last night  The Sox won  in the bottom
of the th  Who won the game

Clemens pitched a strong nine  innings allowing only two runs
Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent
 defensive plays behind him to do so
Quantrill pitched a couple of innings gave up the goahead run and
 got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of
 the inning

Looks like a team effort to me  Yet only Quantrill got credit for
the win

How about the offense
Dawson and Vaughn hit I think HRs early in the game  Without either
 one the Sox would have lost in nine
Quintana led off the th with a solid single
Zupcic pinchran for Quintana providing the speed to go from first
 to third when
Cooper ripped a second single in the inning
Melvin avoided the DP getting the run home with a sac fly  Not much of
 a help but it was something
Scrub Richardson then hit a double scoring the speedy Cooper all the
 way from first  Hill's lack of defense helped

Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs Melvin and Richardson were
credited with RBIs  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit
that set up the whole inning  And did Melvin really contribute as
much as Richardson

Furthermore people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than
runs  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper  Cooper provided the
gamewinning baserunner and moved the tying run to third base with
only one out

Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous  You
can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the
clutch but RRBI don't do any better  At least OBP and SLG don't
claim to try to tell you that

Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory
All  of them

kingcogsciucsdedu Jonathan King writes

Perhaps you can give a more recent citation of any player mentioned as a 
malingerer Thanks

I guess I don't understand your question  I was trying to imply that
the accusations of Glenn Davis' malingering were certainly not played
up very much  

Still if the 'whispers' reached San Francisco it is certainly possible they
were stronger elsewhere Also it was teammates making the aspersions In any
event I know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years

But in any case I believe Mike Lavalliere has been accused of poor
work habits and general sloth recently probably not malingering
just as he was being released  It's interesting that nobody heard
much about these problems before if they were so important

I have heard Sanders called many things as well I have NOT heard him called
lazy Given the sport phenomenon it would be difficult to label him as
such

Exactly so  Which means his media detractors have had to say other
things about him  I believe it's a general phenomenon that if writers
don't like you they'll find a label that will stick no matter who you
are  I find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in
why writers feel they need to act this way  Not that this fascinates
me that much either

Uh the original author's point was that black and white players were por
trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected
list to prove his case Sanders' name showed up eventually I dispute that
Sanders has ever been called lazy by the media 

Hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc Is that GOOD press

No but it isn't the total extent of the press he received in
Pittsburgh where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and
spoiled by the local columnists  Again the actual words used may
shift around with time and expediency but lazy tends to be higher
on the list for nonwhite players at least in my subjective opinion

Aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study
on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken
and on teams like the Red Sox which have been traditionally white
Nowadays most people think of Carl Yastrzemski as one of those
bluecollar hardworking guys but in the early s he was often
portrayed as a lazy bum  Really

Hmm I never heard anyone accuse Canseco of being lazy Nor Sierra

I've heard accusations that Canseco was a bad fielder but could be a
great one if he put his mind to it  Ignoring whether or not he is a

Actually Dave Stewart is was one of the most vocal about this In any 
event that is not lazy

At least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the
Cansecoislazy issue so I think your point is at best a quibble and
probably weaker than that

Uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first It is NOT a
quibble then to state that the media did not portray Canseco as being 
lazy If the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not
make it a quibble And in fact the media around here tended to play up his
time in the wieght room Hardly lazy and hardly a quibble Have you ever
seen any mediot portray Canseco as lazy Unconcerned with his fielding yes
Lazy no

bad fielder I think this is still interesting  For that matter I
think Canseco's colorful offfield antics get lots more national
attention than those of say Roger Clemens

Well he's had a few more of them

At least more that you've heard about  I think one of the questions
here surrounds selective reporting  Having said that I have to say
that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be
unfalsifiable at least by those of us who aren't reporters police
or private investigators

Well Canseco has been involved in several felonies including his highspeed
record carrying concealed firearms and of course the domestic violence 
Clemens had a runin at a bar Canseco had that as well and in both cases the
coverage was relatively minimal

Puckett Stewart Jackson 

I said overrepresent nonwhites  Three anecdotal data points don't
make an interesting counterargument  BTWwhich Jackson are we talking
about here  Reggie Bo Darrin Danny or 

Uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the
counter to it is also anecdotal

And it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title among
others has been accused at some time of caring more for his own
stats than for the good of the team  It also seems to me that you're

Kirby Puckett I have NEVER heard this accusation made of Puckett I 
have heard it of Boggs Actually I believe it of him but that's another 
matter

Not living in Minnesota I can't say whether or not this line has ever
been used against Kirby there  As far as Boggs goes I'm not sure why
you bring him up since he's one of the obvious prototypes for the line
I quoted along with Ted Williams Rod Carew and many others

Uh yes and I agree with your assesment of Boggs rather specifically However
you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of
selfishness I have not ever anywhere heard this said of Puckett Pendleton
either Similarly Brett B Williams and others  

How about Daryl Strawberry And I think the plus or minus refers more to 
the born again types ie Butler and Gaetti

Again you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes  On the other
hand my argument by is of the becausejonsaysso variety if we have
no other data  I have to admit I have problems generating lists of
nonwhite players who became infamous for their religious or
political beliefs while names like Butler Gaetti Dravecky Knepper
Hersheiser et al come rolling out

There are others Perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the
case of the bornagain types I mention

Who holds the record for most career strikeouts while playing for one team
Who holds the record for most career strikeouts for the Rangers
Hint Nolan Ryan isn't either
What two pitchers have over  career saves for two different teams

Who is the only player to hit  or more career home runs and steal  or 
more career bases for the same team

Phil Allen

I'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted

For most career K's with one team if it's not Ryan perhaps Steve Carlton

	No way  gotta be Walter Johnson  All were with Washington
Carlton spent too long in St Louis to collect less than  there

With the Rangers Hough was there for a long time

	I'd also guess Hough due to his length of tenure though I suspect 
Bobby Witt wasn't far behind  Maybe even Jenkins snuck in close

In the  saves departmentMaybe Lee Smithhe should have at least
a hundred with the Cubbies maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards
Then maybe GossageNYY and SD Fingers MIL OAK

	Fingers had to have achieved  with either MIL or with SD so yes
I'd go with that guess  Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better
chance of having  with MIN along with I would think easily reaching  
with MON

Don't know about the homerssteals dept

	Gotta be Willie MaysI am fairly sure he had over  steals in his
career

In some other articleMets trivia it could be Tim Leary in at least
the losing to all teams maybe beating all of 'em too  Probably Seaver
and Koosman fit too

	HmmmLeary is a really good point  I'd forgotten about him  Well
if nothing else there are plenty of exMet pitchers in the category of
could have lost to all teams  Koosman Leary Torrez Ryan Seaver
I guess the best three guesses would be Leary Ryan and either Seaver or
Koosman

For the record there are two ways that a reliever can get a save
He must finish the game and either
 have entered the game with the tying run on base at bat or on deck
 have pitched at least three innings effectively
A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game


Close but there's a number  also

 have entered the game with no more than a  run lead and pitched
   at least one inning

If a pitcher finishes a game which his team has won does not get the win
and satisfies at least one of the three requirements he gets a save

the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a
large enough portion of the population and have suggested various
remedies such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that
smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation is an accurate description
of what is essentially a laidback game

forget those lame ideas  here is my new and exciting twopoint plan to
generate interest in baseball among the masses

point one sex
point two violence

let's face it sex and violence are the only things that sell in
america  here's how we can implement them in the game

sex cheerleaders cheerleaders and more cheerleaders  dancing on top
     of the dugouts  bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh
     inning stretch  running up and down the stands  the south bend
     white sox actually do this

violence baseball players are such utter wuss boys  the pitcher beans
     the batter and both benches empty in what is called a benchclearing
     brawl  EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER stand
     stand stand  look look look  ho hum  then the bullpens
     come running in  when they reach the fight they just stand
     there too

     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch
     should be suspended and fined  further the bullpens should fight
     it out in the outfield so as not to waste time and energy running
     to the infield



I think what Bob is describing here is a game which MAD magazine
called 'Basebrawl'  I have no idea what issue but it sure did cover
the violence issue

 batter and to my amazement the umpire missed it  In the  years
 that I played ball this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw
                               

    Now this sounds like a fun topic

    In a slo pitch softball game we had the first base dugout One of our
  players hit a shot down the first base line with the bases loaded The only
  question was fair or foul  Ball hits ground chalk flies  Umpire calls
  foul  We give him the standard Didn't you see chalk line  His response
  was It hit the FOUL HALF OF THE LINE  We all started laughing

 Mark Pede


Not bad We had a similar situation Slowpitch softball bases loaded
weakest hitter at the plate He hits a line drive over the third
baseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in
foul ground almost hitting the fence down that side of the field
But the umpire called fair ball I was coaching third yelling at evrybody 
to move up a base The ump's position it was still fair when it
passed third base 
Why the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know we
certainly weren't going to argue about it since every body did manage
to advance one base safely

There was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my runner
from second base leg fielded by the SS steps on second to force the
runner from first and throw to first in time for what the umpire
called a triple play protest removed when we won the game anyway

I was just wondering if anyone knew when Erickson

exactly ails them

Dunno about Miller

If you mean Scott Erickson currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent

about the infield fly rule
So if he's feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up  If it isn't caught he's probably scored
a run  If it is he's probably headed for AAA  

	Unless he's Deion Sanders in which case he just heads back to the

the best home run i have ever seen came off believe it or not
Roger Clemens sorry Val a couple of years ago he threw a ball to
Incaviglia which was literally at Inky's neck and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it after the swing Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ballhe didn't even turn around to look or
even get upset the ball hit the lights in the leftfield standard
some  or so feet about the Green Monster over  feet above the
ground total

truly an amazing shot

I agree  Home runs off Clemens are always memorable  Kinda like
eclipses and hurricanes  They don't happen very often

Did you see the same game I saw Gant most reasonable argued a
horrible call which Hirschbeck correctly did nothing about Gant
then proceeded to walk halfway to rd base lean on his bat and
glare at Hirschbeck While I don't necessasarily subscribe to the
theory of showing people up this was an obvious attempt by Gant to
do so to Hirschbeck He left Hirschbeck no choice but to take control
of the situation The bottom line is Gant started a dangerous
power struggle with Hirschbeck when his team needed him most and
he lost


The events I saw were
  Called strike by Hirschbeck

Was it just me or did it look like Hirschbeck pointed to
the B umpire before calling that strike  I thought that's
why Gant was asking for the appeal to the st base umpire
he thought Hirschbeck had gotten checkedswing help from the wrong
umpire

  Shockedlooking Gant asks for appeal to first
  No appeal to first
  Gant steps out of batters box
  Hirschbeck immediately orders Gant back in  bad move
  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off bad move
  Hirschbeck yells at Gant  Gant is silent
  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch

After Hirschbeck called for the pitch but before the pitch was thrown
Cox came onto the field  It was obvious that he was trying to get time
called before the pitch but no one was watching

  Pitch is called a strike
  Cox argues couldn't see when he came on the field
  Cox is ejected players everywhere
  Play finally resumes


Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out the
whole incident probably would have been avoided

Your listing pretty much agreed with what I saw with the aforementioned
addendums  Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark  Personally
I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected  But that's why Cox did
it's called protecting your players

And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game
all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history  Even in
the worst baseball brawls usually only the major instigators are
ejected not everyone who comes onto the field  And I'd have to 
say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game
 than what the Braves did Fri night

Anyhow that's my last two cents on the subject barring
outrageous postings  I will try to keep my eyes open
for more incidents involving Hirschbeck I think there will
be some with other teams as well  I hope not

 I watched the final inning of Bosio's nohitter with several people at
 work After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
 middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he
 wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out Yet the throw beat Riles
 by about two steps I wonder how many others who watched the final out
 think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand
 
 In this morning's paper or was it on the radio Vizquel was quoted as
 saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
 easily thrown out Riles that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
 final play more memorable  Seems a litle cocky to me but he made it
 work so he's entitled

i guess so
still that's kind of a stupid move IMO he'd be singing a different
tune if he had booted it and the next guy up had hit a bloop single
stranger things have happened hey i used to be a big Dave Stieb fan
and unfortunately there's no such thing as an unearned hit 

cheers

    If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time X   to 
      without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base
      as if walked

This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably  Suppose the pitcher uses up N of his N pickoff
attempts  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time


If it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead it would probably
also result ina greater number of pickoffs I think it would be a
workable rule but it would probably be best to experiment in another
league before trying it in the bigs

 How about Matt Nokes  run single against Ron Darling  Was that a hit or what  
 While watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding The
 Boss' talking about Mark Connor as bullpen coach  He said something like it's
 Mark Connor's fault that the bullpen is so horrible  Here we go again 
 George sticking his nonbaseball nose in the baseball business  Shut up
 George just spend the money get the players and leave Buck and the coaches
 and players alone
 
  	I saw that quote flashed on the screen yesterday also and what enraged
me more than anything was not that George was speaking up agai and complaining
to the media instead of to the proper people it was that the idiot reporter
provided George with an outlet and an opportunity to create trouble  This is a
supreme example of how the media can truly control situations  The local beat
reporters should know better and should stop trying to oneup each other with
quotes from the Boss  If they just ignored him he'd really simply go away
and problems would be avoided  What that reporter did was potentially to open
up the floodgates againasshole

I don't actually have the answer to this one

Bosio after walking the first two batters retired straight for a
backend perfect game

Well there were  outs in a row with no hits or walks in between but
really he only retired  batters in a row  The first out of the game
was the front end of a double play  Still counts as a backend perfect
game in my book though 

Congrats to Chris Bosio  Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to him

 I disagree on one point  Velarde  Yes maybe the Yanks should have let
 him develop but he rode the Columbus Shuttle way too many times to do  
so
 Probably the fault of George but no matter now  His usefulness is  
done
 he will not be able to develop into a good player this deep in his  
career
 at least I don't think so  His fielding is horrendous at rd maybe
 he'd be good at short he can't his the curve at all and I think all
 his trips from New York to Columbus and back have demoralized him to the
 point that he just doesn't care  Get rid of him I saythe sooner the
 better for both the Yanks and Velarde

Velarde hasn't been to Columbus if I recall for about three
years  Granted he hasn't been a full time player but
when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat
He might be demoralized about not playing full time but
he hasn't been shuttled around  I think he's been in New York
ever since he had  hits in  AB back in  or  I
believe  
I don't think he is gold glove calibre but he doesn't boot
it around either  I think if Velarde is given a chance
he could become extremely productive  I don't have any stats
to back this up and I don't know if his Defense would
cost any games but I think he could help  and he has
this year  He has  HR already  Same goes for
Jim Leyrtiz  He has a big mouth but he does get
the job done when he concentrates  I think the situation
with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
superstar and he gets pissed about not playing  I
think he might have realized something when the Marlins
or Rockies didn't select him
The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now

Rule k states It is interference by a batter or runner when 
in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base
 he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of
the foul line and in the umpire's judgment interferes with the field
er taking the throw at first base

The key word in the rule is and A runner isn't out just for running
out of the baseline He's out for interfering with the fielding of the
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first Because the catcher
opted to throw the ball over the batterrunner's head there's no inter
ference

Sorry I still don't buy it  You're certainly right that the runner is
not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with
the play  But the argument here is over what constitutes interference
You certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batterrunner
must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you haven't posted
a definition of interference at all

IMO this calls for one of the approved rulings that go in small print
in the rulebook  Something like

APPROVED RULING
If in the judgement of the umpire the runner by running to the left
of the allowed path caused the fielder to make a bad throw blocks the
vision of the fielder receiving the throw or otherwise impedes the
defensive team's making a play on him the batterrunner shall be
judeged guilty of interference

or

APPROVED RULING
The runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes
contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball


In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor
rules trivia questionsince it cannot be authoritatively answered

left field line without counting to  before swinging  Bat speed never 
before seen from a yearold man much less from any Red Sox player to 
precede him

Yes that's him  Was I not specific enough

Just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that
they have a quick bat  Dawson's release is slow and he IS  after
all  He may swing early and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to 
the left side all the time but he swings slowly

As for me disagreeing with Peter Gammons Whoa  That's never happened

Hi there

      I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again
      after his first day period was up I read in the USA Today Sports 
      section that he is on for surgery to repair broken toe and was
      wondering if that was new I thought he was just letting it heal 

      Another question Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now
      that Olin is gone I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to 
      replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok Any information on
      either of the players would be greatly appreciated Thank you for your
      time

I've been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the
net for a while I figured I'd stick my neck out a bit

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL
team since the inception of the DH rule  ps any ideas what this is

They will fall easily short of  runs that's for damn sure  I can't
believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our
Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of
genius for the tradesaquisitions he's made

off gingerly because of the small amount of spring training work or what

	The Mets are REALLY starting him off slow Mike Maddax and
Young can do the job of closing Torborg has said that he Franco is
his closer but will give him rest and not rush him since there is no
need He does not want Franco to get hurt on his return I have this
guy so I know what it is like to see him pitch  inns in that lat 
weeks 

			TAC

Well they just said that Franco will probably go on the DL tomorrow
They mentioned a career minor leaguer as the warm body who would go 
alongI forget

Also when answering questions about the rotation Coleman SD 
broadcaster said that Hurst is gone in about a monthmonth and a half 
which is when he should finish rehab

Later

hammered the crap out of it after the swing Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ballhe didn't even turn around to look or
even get upset the ball hit the lights in the leftfield standard
some  or so feet about the Green Monster over  feet above the

truly an amazing shot

I was at that game behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the 
radar gun  The  season was winding down and Roger didn't have his 
best fastball topping out at  in contrast to Frank Tanana who went 
as low as  with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil 
Plantier five times on the night  Inky's shot would have gone further
than any I've ever seen if it hadn't crashed into the lights not the 
lightstand as you say over  feet high Roy Hobbslike and bounced 
back onto the field  That had to have been a footer if unobstructed
edging out Bo Jackson's drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the
centerfield bleacher back wall in  for the best I've seen personally

	This chatting about the best player of all time is pointless  You
can't compare players from different era's  

Of course you can  You just have to be careful about what conclusions
you draw

If you will notice the best
pitchers stat wise were in the 's and 's and the best all around hitters
probably came from the 's to 's  

Huh  The 's and 's were the worst decades for great pitching  Grove
Vance Dean and not a whole lot else  

As for the best allaround hitters statwise Ruth Gehrig Foxx Greenberg
Hornsby Cobb etc all played before the 's  Statwise the 's were 
a graveyard for hitters

Now we have a great number of great
pitchers and an equally great number of great hitters and fielders Also

How do you know  Which ones do you consider great

about fielding the gloves were much smaller than they are now in the early
years of baseball  Maybe a hitter like Sheffield with the  BA hr and
 RBIEven though it was probably a fluke year can be compared to a Mantle
because the pitching Sheffield faces is faster and not to mention better The

So  Sheffield also has better shoes  More time between pitches  You can
run the comparison but there are lots of things to take into account

same could be said for Frank Thomas who is said to be the best hitter since Ted
Williams although Frank's defense does suck

Well can we compare them or can't we

	All I am saying is that you can't compare players from different era's
if you want a best player try choosing best players from different era's That

Why  We can compare players to the standard of their era and we can
keep in mind eratoera differences without throwing up our hands in
despair

way there is reasonable basis for comparison

You haven't shown us what's unreasonable about the MAntleSheffield
comparison that you yourself did

These things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real

like he used to tell his checkers If the customers don't come back I don't
need as many checkers This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie  he was a competent
businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public

Interesting article Craig  It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball
teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their
customers  No other business could ever get away with the th century 
attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs  I guess the
owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary
to bring th century business practices into the game but they don't
realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they
pay in terms of longterm popularity by not doing better by the game
and its fans

The reason I'm unhappy with the length of games today is summed up above
For an extra  minutesgame average in the AL and an extra  minutes
average in the NL I'm seeing fewer runs score 

Now what I think I am seeing is more pitches  More strikeouts over
game in the AL over game more in the NL more walks game more in

Yep  And the Ks don't have to denote a slow game either  Last night
Sid Fernandez was mowing the Giants hitters down  Ks in  innings
yet the first   innings of the game were quite brisk

He also threw  pitches leading me to believe it isn't just the
number of pitches that determines the length of a game but the 
behavior between pitches

I don't understand this at all  Matt Williams has demonstrated
throughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit
He won't take walks  He'd rather swing  If I'm the opposing pitcher
why would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well
when I know that Williams will swing and miss or at least not hit
very well at a low and away curve

Matt's problem is really more ability than attitude  It isn't that he's
got it in his mind that he wants to swing away but rather that he's
still a total sucker for the curve ball  It looked for a while in
 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point

As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him the 
netstatmavens will probably tell you there's no reason that it
should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling
prophecy

As to whether the Giants' lineup is optimal  who knows  Batting Bonds
the team's best hitter fifth does seem to be odd but the  and 
hitters aren't exactly Messrs OBA so they aren't giving much up
there  And although Clark isn't the overall offensive force that Bonds
is he seems better suited to the  spot  Assuming of course that
he starts hitting one of these days

The key words here are in the past  Everybody was warned before the

When I see this happening to other players I'll post a public apology to

OK  It would be a shame for Cards fans on the net
to go through the  championship season without a 
mailing list to talk on so I would be willing to look
at starting one

Except there's one little problem

I don't know the first thing about how to do it or 
what it requires in terms of resources or time  So
if some kind soul could email me the particulars of
getting starting and managing a mail list I'd see
if it would be feasible for me to start a Cards mailing 
list

Thanks in advance

 Hi there
 
 I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now
 There are many problems occuring for me One of them is the ERA statistic for
 pitchers What does it say 

ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per
nine inning game  Thus if a pitcher pitched  innings and gave up  earned
run his  inning equivelent perfomance would be  earned runs thus his ERA
is   To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 

	ERA  ERIP  

I think there is another formula for ERA  I heard something about it last 
year  Im not sure what it is but im gonna give it a stab  It allows for
a pitcher to pitch more than  innings at a time and not benefit cuz it
uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched

        ERA  ERouts recorded

Like i said im not sure this is exactly it but im pretty sure they changed
it to something of the sort


An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed
to a fielding error  More specifically if an error occurs that represented
the third out all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs
Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base
when the pitcher exited the game  Here are some examples

	If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  If
	an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after
	this error and NOT counted as earned runs

	If a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game
	before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who
	were left on base  If the those runners who were left on base score
	and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are
	attributed to the pitcher who left the game

I hope this explains things for you

					Joe

Oh probably

Ms Nichols has given the average game times and average runs scored for
 and   A very nice piece of information Ms Nichols  Who knows
She may be listening and not have me in her kill file after all  Those
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of halfarun less being
scored per game and the games taking  minutes longer  Something is
being done now that wasn't done ten years ago which is extending the games
by  minutes  Ms Nichols thinks it's more pitches  Given the increasing
specialization of pitchers it wouldn't surprise me

If it's not simply more pitches though I don't think it's unreasonable
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back  Then
I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher
after he comes in and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules
which have been stated in other posts in this thread and other related ones

The problem is who decides whether that time is wasted  You don't seem
to think it is at all  Right now I think it is although I have heard one
case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs the
difference in mounds between the field and pen  but who knows  If the
rules get changed maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my
mind  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing
or else nothing will be changed

When I say black I mean USborn black people for the purposes of this
discussion  Hispanic players were in baseball before  and one 
team in the 's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did  

What about black hispanics

Good question  It's my impression not backed by evidence that general
southoftheborderness seems to exempt one from the hiringfiring effect
I was talking about  

Back in the 's there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers 
they were rejected by the commissioner and others

And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

Don't know  But remember this is the country that had special racial
			    
laws for one group and one group only blacks  Our national history 
 

Man you had better do some SERIOUS reading I really really doubt that you
meant to say this

Well what did I mean to say  Aside from some shortlived exceptions
such as Japanese internment in WW II only blacks were affected by laws
regarding slavery Jim Crow miscegenation military service etc  If
my claim of exclusivity is not  airtight that is if you can come
up with this or that exception fine  have a cookie  But compared to
this list no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth
discussing at length

ielding RF of all time as far
 	    as anyone can tell

 I did a quick scan last night looking for players with a peak  
comparable
 to or better than Winfield  In my quickndirty subjective judgement  
you
 could make good cases for Ruth Aaron Ott Robinson Clemente Kaline 
 Maris Klein Jackson Waner and probably a few others  This is not a
 knock on Winfield but a comment on his consistency all of those other
 players had awesome stretches and very good stretches while Winfield  
has
 been more uniformly excellent  Hall of Fame  Absolutely  Top peak
 I'm not so sure  Top  total career value  Yes almost certainly

Point taken When was winfield's peak years anyway probably around 

That's the trouble what peak years  He wavers between excellent and
very good with no real bellshaped pattern in there   was a fine
year  and  were merely really good  With the Yankees  I think
was the best that was the one with the  BA  

Of course  wasn't bad either  He's been in the bigs since 
with a oneyear intermission for surgery  Though he doesn't have the
mix of skills that Pete Rose did he's like Pete Rose in one way he's 
not a natural hitter  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing
in New York and that includes the GulfWestern Building  But his sheer
athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot  

Fascinating player to watch even now  Not obviously great in any one
way but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising
levels

 This week's play
 

It took three days to get to us but I'll try anyway as I naturally
haven't seen the answer

 With runners at first and second and one out the batter hits an
 easy pop fly to the third baseman
 
 A The umpires declare the infield fly rule and the third baseman
 lets the ball drop The runner at second heads for third and the
 third baseman flips the ball to the short stop who tags the bag
 before the runner

SAFE The correct call is Infield Fly batter out if fair Runners
may advance at own risk Gotta tag up if caught etc It is not a
force and the pop was not caught so regardless of whether the SS
tags B or B it wasn't clear above he hasn't got the runner out

 B The umpires don't declare the infield fly rule and the third
 baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop who
 tags the runner from second while the runner is between second and
 third

OUT See rule L APPROVED RULING Below In this case the
umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule
doesn't apply Sounds like a bad call here but that's not the
point The batter is not out so a force situation is created
Therefore the runner is out   UNLESS by rule L the ball is
dead AND the batter is safe then I guess the runners would advance
unmolested  I can't really tell from L that the ball is dead in
this situation

 
 What's the call in A and B

Pertinent rules  Definition of Infield Fly When an Infield fly
is called runners may advance at their own risk If on an infield fly
rule the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball the ball remains
in play despite the provisions of Rule L The Infield Fly rule
takes precedence

L A batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair
fly ball or line drive with first first and second first and thrid
or firstsecond and third base occupied before two are out The ball
is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base
or bases APPROVED RULING In this situation the batter is not out if
the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground
except when the infield fly rule applies

they used to  I'm talking about making the strike zone start at the

During the local Rockies broadcast the other day Don Baylor
went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up
on the screen that it was the so and so sponsored pitching 
change I saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored

At other times during the game Rockies announcer Duane Kuiper was
setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation
that Charlie Jones would jump in and discuss the situation But
what does Charlie do he read's a beer advertisement and leaves
Duane hanging Duane's strategy proved prophetic

These examples happen over and over on radio and TV braodcasts
making them sometimes very boring to listen to

I guess it's just a matter of time before a player sells his name
to  Budweiser Nike etc

I don't think it will be long until we hear Nike Budweiser drills

Is it just me or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield

He's been playing horrible defense Baylor said after Wednesday's game that
he wanted to shake up the lineup a little because Bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting
He was true to his word I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston who has a very hot bat was in left
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well

In defense of Bichette it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium
is a bitch to play Some of the visiting outfielders have been having
some problems too although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into
the wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game

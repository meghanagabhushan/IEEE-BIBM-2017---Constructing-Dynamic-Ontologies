Regarding PBS' Frontine on the Iranian Bomb

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous
    visits from 
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

	The IAEA has two conflicting goals  One is to promote the
spread of nuclear energy the other to police its use  Any successful
policing ie finding cheaters shows that its other arm is being
overzealous in its promotion of nuclear energy

	The IAEA announces in advance which sites it will visit  It
allows the country it is inspecting to veto areas on the list by
claiming they are not used for nuclear work  Its inspectors are drawn
from all over the world and few have any experience in bomb building
Such experience would make the job of determining if a site was being
used for military purposes much easier

	Unfortunately many countries object to knowledgeable
inspectors because the only really knowledgeable inspectors come from
about  countries

	There was an excelent article on the Feb   New Yorker on
why the IAEA fails to do its job

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds  In this case
limited and big government are not defined  I would point out that
Lebanon Somalia and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
with limited government while the US Canada and nations in Western 
Europe where people would rather live are often pointed out as 
nations with big government from a libertarian point of view  

Well let me help by explaining the difference between a linited government
and a failed government  A limited government has its powers clearly
circumscribed  but is fully capable of enforcing its decisions within
those circumscribed areas  A failed government is incapable of
enforcing its decisions except sporadicly  Two completely different beasts

Of course one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
power and keeps it circumscribed in a complex society when it is in the 
interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using 
government power for their own ends  But apart from that little 
conundrum

It would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal
setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented  Now why do you suppose
that never seems to occur

 
The argument is not between those who want limited government and those
who want unlimited government  It is between those who believe
government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical 
grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds


regulation is such a vauge word  

I wouldn't call it vague  I'd call it elastic  All regulation is 
not necessarily the same  By opposing all government regulation some 
libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that
regulate relatively free markets as identical  That's one reason
many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic

     Wrong NYC subway breath  Criminals are going to have guns regardless
of what legislative remedy you come up with  However it is the lawabiding
citizens who suffer when guns are harder to obtain  Case in point Washington
DC is the murder capital of the US but has banned handguns and has some
of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation

Overlooking entirely that there is nothing to prevent anyone from
taking the bus across the river to buy guns  An utterly worthless
statistic

  In the UK I read recently that some young women
have been killing even without guns which are nearly impossible to obtain
there and it is a cause of great concern to the Brits

As it should be  They have a homicide rate that is a couple of orders
of magnitude lower then this country's as does almost everyone else
in the world  But I suppose that it's too unreasonable to suppose
that a lower availability of handguns has anything to do with that fact

  Wellarmed citizens
mean that this country will never fear from the government criminals or
invasion

Right  Remember those riots a while back  Remember what they were
about  Nope we have nothing to fear from the US government unlike
those Canadians living under the terribly oppressive regime up north

Why should we want to compare our society which is extremely heterogeneous and
wealthy to one that is basically homogeneous and in dire straits

Britain basically homogeneous  In comparison to the US
Now I know you're an ignorant putz

       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities aired on Tuesday
    April  For the sake of brevity I'll present them in some separate
    points

     As many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of
    misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the
    program on the viewer Some of the misinformations were as follows

     It was alleged that Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological
    advancements as antiIslamic but now things have changed and the proof of
    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers 
    These are the most ridiculous lies one can make about the objectives
    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology
    in Iran after revolution

    Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors
    while there has never been any proof in this regard and nobody has seen
    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons in
    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and
    civilians injured by Iraqi chemical weapons

     While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi
    aggression has been officially announced to be about  and even most
    radical counterrevolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total
    of one million dead this program claims that Iran alone has one million
    dead left from the war

     The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not  true For
    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that  It hurts me to
    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda The
    translator says  It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly
    research

     Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to
    undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power

     The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of
    Technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the
    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed
    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university Taking in account
    the scientific advancement of Sharif U in engineering fields and its
    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the
    lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries
    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones
    in scientific and industrial efforts

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

     As an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the
    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs
    William Triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking
    from the absolute knowledge

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

This show is just part of the American propaganda against any
government run by Muslims Iran Sudan Algeria remember democracy
Pakistan Palestine sorry Occupied Territories and many others
We must stop this idea that a government which does not fully
agree with American policies is not evil and dangerous as the media
attempts to portray it

On a case by case basis the costbenefit ratio of government regulation
is obviously worthwhile  The libertarian agenda however does not call
for this assessment  It assumes that the costs of regulation of any
kind always outweigh its benefits  This approach avoids all sorts of 
difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic 
to say the least


I assume you mean that analyzing the costbenefit ratio of government
regulation on a case by case basis is worthwhile  Let me suggest that
this is not an option  Regulators regulate  it's what they do

I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option  No one suggests that
such analysis should be left to regulators  In fact the reinventing
government movement provides just such a costbenefit approach to the
analysis of public spending  Libertarians would do well to learn more
about it 


	It might be possible to pass an amendment which would prevent
any liscensing laws from being valid  assuming you could convince people that
it would overall be a good idea  Eliminating the liscensing laws which
serve no good purpose the vast majority of them while maintaining the
worthwhile ones assuming there are any is not  feasible

Sorry but it strikes me that it is the only feasible approach  What is
not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and 
licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent
tasks


I have no objection to an analysis of medical care education 
national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide
a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives
than is provided through statist approaches   With some notable
exceptions however I do not see such nittygritty worthwhile 
analysis being carried out by selfprofessed libertarians  
 
jsh

I note that the above examples tend to be among the few government areas 
likely to win some approval among libertarians anyway  

Actually the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense
It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
be to a principle of noncoercion the only areas of public spending
that they frequently support involve hiring people with gunshmmm

The most objectionable government expenditures are entitlements  which
also are the biggest  Certain individuals will suggest that these should be
considered defense on the grounds that they are a sort of Danegeld to
wouldbe revolutionaries  but I personally don't feel we have much to fear
from an alliance of geezers and unwed mothers  Maybe I've led too
sheltered a life

Perhaps you have  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries
frequently generate support by acting as protectors of geezers 
mothers and children  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds
that we don't have much to fear from them do so at their own peril

In article CnwHIzvdscomsadesyde hallamdscomsadesyde Phill HallamBaker writes

       Or are they simply propogranda  We can't know what Phill really
means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince

I make no secret of what I am up to I have stated explicitly in posts
that I am a political propagandist on numerous occasions Anyone posting
to this group who is not probably has the wrong group

For example I have on numerous occasions stated quite clearly that I
beleive that certain factions of the gun lobby are the worst possible
advocates of their cause and I am prepared to do anything in my power
to provide them with a platform because they can convince people far
better than I could hope that many people with a fixation on lethal
weapons are dangerous and derranged 

       If you happen to know a political position which does not
have people advocating it who do more harm than good please point it
out
       
Some people have even accused me of inventing such advocates purely 
for the purpose of having them trash a set of political views In 
fact this would be a futile tactic because I could never hope to
invent a character as dangerous as sybokathenaedu a man who I
quite seriously believe to be mentaly ill and a potential psychopath
Unfortunately the local sherifs office have informed me that they
are unable to act untill he attacks someone

       One of the advantages and drawbacks of requiring proof
on the part of the government before they may take action against
citizens  and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should
be available

So if you were to ask me what is the point that I am trying to make
from this current argument on the absolute sanctity of the US 
constitution what would I answer

       We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the US
Constitution  In fact the fillibuster we're talking about isn't
in the Constitution  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate
wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given

Firstly I see that the current US political scene like the UK political
scene has become tied to special interests Rather than chase the
convenient caricatures put about by the media and polititians themselves
for this  Gay rights cmapaigners environmentalists zionists ie
Jews foreign lobbyists  whatever voting power they have etc I
sugest that you look at who is really benefiting The inevitable conclusion
is that it is the major corporations owned by the ultrawealthy that
have benefited Regan and Bush created what can only be described as a
welfare state for the rich 

       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority
in the Senate during his first term and his coalition in the House
came apart at about the same time  Bush never had any real support in
Congress

       The real point is that everybody everywhere got their pork
from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a
convenience store with an armful of junkfood he'd bought with
food stamps  He spent more in food stamps on junk than I make in a week
and I'm not on government assitance

Money was diverted from programs addressing
social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost
plus profits contracts 

       Lessee let's pull out the old Almanac

       In  total US government budget outlays were  billion
dollars  In  est they were  trillion dollars an increase of
approx  billion dollars

       In  National Defense cost  billion dollars  In
 it was  billion dollars and increase of  billion dollars
That leaves an increase of  billion dollars unaccounted
for  This represented an increase of 

       In  Income Security which includes retirement programs
Housing Assitance and unemployment benefits and I believe welfare
cost  billion dollars  In  it was  billion dollars or
more than national defense started  This represented an increase
of 

       In  the Federal Government spent  billion dollars on
Medicare  In  they spent  billion dollars  an increase of


       In  the Feds spent  billion dollars on housing
credits and subsidies of that like  In  it was  billion

       In  Health care services and research was  billion
dollars  In  it was  billion dollars

       Agriculture up  billion to  billion

       Science up  billion to  billion

       Resource conservation up  billion to  billion

       Education up  billion to  billion

       Veteran benefits up  billion to  billion

       Trasnportation up  billion to  billion
     
       About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under 
the Energy category primarily under Supply and Community Development
in the area of disaster relief and between the two of them
represent a loss of less than  billion dollars

       Where was this huge diversion

In order to rectify this situation there must
be constitutional revision

       Not that's a stretch  If the current government was pushed by
the President to create this mess wouldn't one expect it to begin to
equalize once the pressure is gone

Secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed 
circumsatnces of the role of the Federal government 

       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want
to continue I see very little positive about it

The constitution
cannot be used to frustrate the democratic process 

       The Constitution was designed to frustrate the democratic
process so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting
what they wanted by the time it happened  Nor do I see putting the
brakes on the democratic process an inherently bad thing  Califronia's
riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense
it gets worse

If the peoplr want
to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have
it

       Sometimes or perhaps most of the time the people should be
told no and pointed to their local government       

Attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only
leads to the constitution being brought into disrepute 

       Phill would you do me the very great favor of repeating that
in talkpoliticsguns

Methods will
always be found to bypass such provisions and once the government gets
used to bypassing those provisions they will bypass the others up to 
the first ammendment 

       Cute  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating
the law

This is a major reason why the right to own 
guns should be excluded the implication that this right is equal to
the right to free speech is dangerous 

       Free speech alone is dangerous Phill

People know that mass ownership
of lethal weapons causes thousands of murders a year the dangerous
conclusion they may reach is that the first ammendment may also be
the same dangerous mistake 

       OK Phill  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of
reduction in homicide rates across several countries and that'll
be it  Not current mind you reduction

Note however that this is not the slippery
slope argument It is because the right freedom of speech has been
chained to the privilege to own weaponry that the danger arises The
advocates of this pivilege must not be allowed to chain freedom of
speech to their cause such that if they fall freedom of speech falls
as well Such actions are not the actions of people genuinely interested
in freedom


        Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech  By calling
it a freedom  

Thirdly and most importantly I want to discover a mechanism wherby I can
engender intellectual debate as opposed to totemic debate I consider
the grave threat to civilisation to be the loss of the ability to
reason about the political debate at anything other than the superficial
level The objection I raise to your basing your case entirely on the
assertion of the supremacy of the US constitution is that the currency
of your argument is limited to the currency of the totem upon which it
is based The danger of totems is that they can be reinterpreted in
different ways by different people 

       Phill you're a master of subtly changing the subject  I haven't
based my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution  I've
tried to explain why it isn't a good idea  The only time I've referred
to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions
on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were meant but
just didn't make it in there
     
       The Constitution doesn't contain the  fillibuster rule
I only believe that the rule is a good idea  You cn't dismiss that
as venerating the Constitution because it isn't in the Constitution

     As usual this issue of dysfunction of bad values of messed up culture 
is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining
problems in our community From your post you apparently find the idea that
something is wrong with African Americans valuewise culture wise or
something very appealing I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african
americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert
that something is wrong with us The socioeconomic factors which we know help 
to produce high crime levels like poverty which exists among us in large 
proportion I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems we
somehow become exempt from all these types of factors and the problem is 
laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have But 
nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction No that has 
socioeconomic factors to it but for africa americans its gotta be a 
dysfunction

Basically I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that
something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to
deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african
americans and that this is about  of the problem It could not possible be
that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us that this has
a very effective negative effect on us No something is wrong with us
Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say because they 
are so busy trying to find something wrong with us instead of taking a good 
hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage I would get angry if it 
werent' so damn typical

	Without having a complete answer to this question  I should think
it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be
a desirable result  There are still quite a lot of people who feel that
the command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than
essential weaknesses of caommand economies  and you still have a majority
in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on
the books in order to send a signal


It would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal
setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented  Now why do you suppose

I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place  Constant
combat isn't particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing  Also
they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway

Umm is there any distinction between vague and elastic in this

At any rate  we've been through all this before

    Not at all I am not a member of the Religious Left Right
    or even Center In fact I don't consider myself very
    religious at all  this will probably result in flames now 
     In fact Phil you should leave religion out of it It just
    clouds the issue

The religous left worships trees rivers the planet and hates people

And the religious right worships engines smokestacks landfills
and hates people

What does this namecalling have to do with anything you are claiming about
the truth of environmental disaster  Nothing that I have read in this
thread nor heard from anyone I have talked to would suggest to me that 
people fit the definition you give of the religious left  Come off it Phil
A prime motivation for protecting our environment is so that we 
people can continue to live in it healthily  We just disagree on what
is necessary to maintaining a healthy environment FOR PEOPLE

    Show me all these environmental disasters Most of them
    aren't And the natural disasters we have had individually
    far outweigh the manmade ones

      Russ's response deleted to save space

I guess you missed the newspaper articles this week about Exxon presenting
evidnce through the ASTM on the issue of the Valdez incident Seems
that Valdez is mostly recovered despite the Religious Left's cries of
      
hundreds of years

What They have already repaired that old hulk  WOW 

I suppose you mean the Alaskan shores that were devastated by the
Valdez accident  I haven't seen the articles  What do they say exactly
Has mostly all the ocean and shore life returned  The sands are mostly
as clean as they were before  The microbial samples are mostly back to 
a normal balance The fish and fowl populations have mostly returned  What

Then again the Relgious Left claimed it would take  yearsb to put out
the Kuwait oil fires

                          You should face the facts Love Canal
was not and is  not an environmental disaster nor even a problem

Nor is Times Beach and TMI and acid rain killing trees and 

Not a problem  Would you move to Three Mile Island  I would imagine 
there is some cheap property available  

The naturally occurring catastrophic events disasters that destroy 
property ie hurricanes tornados earthquakes do not usually leave 
toxic wastes that prevent people from rebuilding their lives there  
The manmade disasters oil spills toxic dumping radioactive waste 
dispersions cause death and make an area unliveable far beyond the 
initial event

 
There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster Weird eh

These opinions are MINE and you can't have 'em But I'll rent 'em cheap

Just a couple of questions for the proIsraeli lobby out there

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary  For Mr
Stein  I am working on a proof for you that Israel is diverting
water to the Jordan River away from Lebanese territory

 Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
temporary  If so for those of you who support it why were so
many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
let's hear it

       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords than
we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also
In fact they both were because the British government had much
greater power than did the American system       

In principle no in practice yes 

        In principle no  That they had less power of that they should have
had less power

The British parliament in principle has absolute power So does the Monarch
Much of the stability of the system rests on what is not defined clearly
In the case of a clear abuse by one side or the other the other side
can act to remedy the situation

      Two institutions with absolute power  Cute

      Let's talk practicality shall we  If the Monarch tried to
do something what would happen
  
If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current 
no state subsidy motto they would be better placed As it is there is
plenty of state money being handed out The problem is that it is
distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of
actual need 

       Bingo  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher
levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
in effectiveness

That was not my point 

       But you illustrated the problem very well

In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the
other  states with pork  defense contracts agricultural subsidies etc
Or to be precise  of the states since you need  to beat the filibuster

       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York  I
remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable
of educating its own children if that's what they want to do  

The point is of redistribution of cash from the poor areas of the ecconomy
to the rich ones 

       I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does
not have ample wealth if they choose to spend it to run a perfectly
acceptable Education system  I further contend that the amount of money
being spent now is more then sufficient but is being spent badly

Or vice versa if you aren't a Republican 

       So tell me Phill  Were the Republicans also responsible for some
of the huge increases in social programs  Or were they only 
responsible for what you don't like  I contend it is Congress which
is to blame  Democrat and Republican alike

If society
simply writes off any areas of the country that is ecconomically weak you
end up with a basket case ecconomy There are inevitable cycles in any
business Some of these act in phase to produce the business cycle
Others are countercyclic Localities can experience boom to bust cycles
outside the national trend To produce a strong ecconomy you need to
ensure that the bust areas do not fall bellow the level where they
cannot be ecconomically rebuilt 

       Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe
In any case we're talking about education  

If the industry in an area collapses
the US as a whole still has a responsibility to ensure that the children
in that area get a good education In some areas of the US schools are closing
halfway through the year for lack of money

       Yes I live in once such area  You're woefully ignorant of the
situation

       At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing
down the Governor asked for  million dollars for bicentenntial
celebration license plats  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise
unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it
 
       I don't know about the rest of the country but our education
problems stem directly from two problems neither of which are a lack
of money in the state  BTW Tennessee is considered a tax heaven
and our economy is one of the strongest in the country  I see
a correlation    What money we spend goes primarly to administration
The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average
teacher makes and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue  And 
the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an Education crisis
in order to push for his pet income tax  Some of the most idiotic
programs get funded like State funds for new art in the county seat
while schools are closing  It's not a lack of funds  It's an
unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate  Education
is the parental hotbutton  Education is always the first to
but cut because it's easier to get people to pay for their children
than ugly art

       The US Constitution is a nutsandbolts document  The Delcaration
of Independence was the highbrow reasoning  There are a couple of other
examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the
reasoning for the power to grant permits both in Article I Section 

The Declaration on independence cam a decade earlier and has not a line
of justification for the US constitution You could argue that it went
into the broad concepts but little more 

      It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the
consent of the governed  

In fact it is little more than
a protracted whinge More to do with the price of tea than the design of 
a government It would be a pretty daft idea for a bunch of guys to
sit arround designing the structure of the new government while the little
matter of the British army remained to be settled 

      They did it anyway  The Continental Congress had its own set of
bylaws  It wasn't quite a government but a means of making decisions
had to be created  However low George Washington's opinion of them were

       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something
it wasn't intended  However I also believe it is inevitable considering
the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
want them to say  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying
about the veto which is fine but of the problem in Congress which
almost necessitates its abuse

The Congress is the most democratic body in the whole system 

      Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders
So what  The government was built with a very nondemocratic Presidency
with fairly broad powers including the veto

It has not only
the fairest system of election but the two year term means that the
members have always got a recent mandate

      Yes and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this
Too much democracy was intentionally avoided  It was considered a good
thing to place nondemocratic blocks to impulsive action

On the other hand if the period of election were to be made  years in
antiphase to the Presidential cycle there would be much less dependence
on fund raising from special interests than there is at present

      So long as Congress has something to sell people will pay for
it  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need

       Why not  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system
against action  Historically governemnt action in the US when
dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
not been successful  When you're in a position of imposing federal
power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to
got through something more than a bare majority

In other words David thinks that the reactionaries should need only 
votes while progressives should need 

       No if the progressives don't want the reactionaries to move
backward they get the same benefit   of the states is a lot of
people  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent'
very effective especially since it is usually geographically
concentrated
       When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't
have to make a better argument than more people than not agree
       
Now we know why nobody calls the Republicans democrats

       I'm not a Republican  I'm a republican  
       
       And no I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat
       
       Now I've asked several times and all you've done is answer
It isn't democratic which I knew before I said it  Why should
it be democratic  We don't have a true direct democracy and few
people advocate one  Why then is this other modification of
democracy to bias it against action so much worse

       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities aired on Tuesday
    April  For the sake of brevity I'll present them in some separate
    points

Already say it the other week on CBC Snoozeworld

     Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to 
    undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power


Why the hell would such an oil rich and hydroelectric potential to be
exploited spend billions on a nuclear energy programme

     For several reasons including

      With the current rate of growth of population and considering the
        million people who are already living there the oil reserves
       won't last for more than  years and after that Iran has to have
       other sources of energy

      Even with unlimited resources of oil it is the most wastefuls and
       foolish way to burn the oil just for thermal energy while thousands 
       of valuable derivatives could be taken from oil For example I
       bought an iron for  here in Canada later I bought a garbage
       bucket for our kitchen for nearly  The bucket has been made
       from  petroleum products and I bet the producing country has not
       received even  cents for the amount of the oil used in that bucket
       while the western producer thank to the monopoly they have in 
       technology and are trying to maintain it in all fields of science by 
       methods you saw in that program makes billions of dollars every
       year

      Iran's hydropotential is something around  MW which won't be
       enough in less than  years Even exploiting this potential takes
       billions of dollars and so many years which can not catch up with
       the rate of growth in Iran's energy production

      More important than all above the science is not the belonging of any
       specific group or nation It is none of anybody's business if a nation
       want's to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes if that nation has
       accepted international monitoring something which Iran has done

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

Yeah and we have every reason in the world to trust the Iranian regime
After all they've been so forward with us in the past

      You can do whatever you want to But fair people of the world won't 
  accept any of your screams when they see the constant observations
  of IAEA from Iranian sites and their constant rejection of the idea that
  Iran has a nuclear bomb production program

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

hahahahahahaahah

     Good sense of humor Since you have been sleeping during past few
  years I remind you to look at all Iran's neighbors from Kashmir and
  Afghanistan Tajikestan to Azerbaijan Armenia Georgia Iraq Lebanon
  Palestine boreder between Saudi Arabia and Qatar etc to see that only
  Iran is in calm and peaceful situation Also look at Iran's stance with
  regard to Iraqi occupation of Kuwait war between Armenia and Azerbaijan
  civil war in Afghanistan etc to understand what  wise and calculated
  approach is all about

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees
 
Lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really

why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance


Then why do we really need national health insurance then Wouldn't it just make
more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance

And maybe that's not such a good thing I also read somewhere that it is next to
impossible in Canada to litigate against the health systemclass action suits
are nearly impossible and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all

 
Part of the deal for using the allinsurance approach like the French
and Germans do hey why don't they criticize France and Germany  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick  was to preserve the doctors independance
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented the politicallybent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service

Oh no Don't let the AMA know about this They have enough power as it is Ask
most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful

For nonlife threatening things market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand  I have MD friends who can't
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they won't get enough customers  the CMA medical
monopoly's grip on doctors licencing as in the US aside  so they
must move to larger places  However this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care as has been done in the
US by Consumers Reports health policy studies cited by Prof Dennis
E Shea on USENET CNN NYT etc

Well yeah tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa
Theoretically it's limited to service personnel but some studies I've heard
about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not
only have connections but aren't urgent at all

The problem is in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the
government how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions
I bet that if you're an MP or MPP or good friends with one you're put on any
hospital's urgent care list no matter how minor your problem Which is OK 
unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot

WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  
FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS  

In Canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  
care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private  
hospital rooms  so many Canadians do end up buying some private  
insurance A policy to cover all of these things runs about  to   
a month  

Hmm How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent
on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting 
Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do

 
Of course the one thing to note is that in the CanadaFranceGermany
case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public
sector  They realized they were keeping lowriskhighprofit extra
insurance for things like privatesemiprivate rooms vs ward
accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal
benefits they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care
 
At that point they wouldn't even consider a voucher approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse Bob Rae the
second least popular man in Ontario warned Ontarians a few years ago that if
they didn't stop crossborder shopping in such huge numbers the services they
expect from the province just won't be there in a few years Fortunately for
them and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York the 
Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value He didn't say so but I
knew he meant the OHIP What would happen if his warning turned out to be the 
truth Would the private insurers take up the slack They'd be under no 
obligation to Of course they could eventually make money again but if what
you say is true they'd be loathe to do so and out of practice in handling 
such basic services too

 
  

WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  
ACHE AND PAIN  

People who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about  
a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  
bills  

Still Canadians  who pay nothing at the doctor's  have a lower  
perperson health bill than we do
 
It is free in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance  which actually it is  I know that when
working in Alberta Ontario and Quebec I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance  eg in Toronto OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only
annually at income tax time built into the tax rate  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it's free along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda

Would that it were free Americans would start another revolution if they had
to pay taxes at Canadian rates

ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  
AND POWERFUL TO KILL  

Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  
politically thorny in the quiet words of one advocate for a  
national plan Some  firms now sell more than  billion in  
health insurance They'd put up a hard fight Not only has the industry  
grown eightfold since Canada shut down its own health insurers but 
our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does  
Canada's parliamentary system
 
Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe its
just that it doesn't cover basic care  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so  ie no market
 
When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance eg neurosurgery versus deluxe
amenities eg having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility  In Quebec
last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan

Again I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that much
power I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers didn't go along with the
provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was
a good chance of the public system going bust in the long run and then 
afterwards they could clean up Okay this sort of contradicts what I said
higher up But it's another possibility They'd have an added bonus when 
arguing against government involvement in their industryas they could then 
point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles

mucho deleteo concerning abortion not being a choice if lower class women

     If all choices should have federal funding so poor people can afford them
then shouldn't firearms be federally subsidized  After all it is the people

criminals  Shouldn't they have federal funding so they can protect themselves
and their families from inner city criminals

Rob

     C'mon Rob  If there is one argument that is ridiculous concerning
abortion it is that prochoice should imply federal funding for abortion 
It's very dishonest

Funding abortion for those women who can't afford it would save the
government money not cost it  The cost of delivery is much higher
and those women can't afford that either  Funding guns as you suggest
as an analogy would cost the government money and would lead to
effective anarchy  See the difference  Somehow I doubt you can

Ouch now that really hurts  I'm being accused of no breadth nor depth
to my historical knowledge because I'm unwilling to agree that economic
inequality leads to poverty and from there to social and political
instability  You go read your history again  POVERTY is the main
engine of social instability in this context we'll put aside religious
turmoil mass migrations etc  

Well the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to 
social and political instability while economic inequality is much more
strongly related  In virtually all major revolutions including
England the Puritan revolution France Russia and China the 
revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term 
growth and poverty was declining  What sets off revolutions is massive
inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom
that social change is possible

If poverty were the main engine of social instability this typical
historical pattern would not hold  In fact revolutions would have been
far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time

 Gee Jim if you'll check the Constitution you'll find in order to
 promote the general welfaredo ordain and establish this Constitution
 I'm surprised you missed it  It's right there in the first paragraph  I
 would have thought you would have made it at least through the preamble

You almost got it right and it was a good try but you should follow your
own advice  The PREAMBLE to the CONSTITUTION does read as you have quoted
but let us not forget that after all it is only the preamble  It is not
a binding part of the Constitution and carries no weight in the law  That 
poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages 
in the English language  witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who
think those vague flowery phrases are part of the law of the land  Do you
really believe that a politician only has to give lip service to promoting
the general welfare to be within the limits of the constitution

Sorry buddy but some other blowhards managed to include the general
welfare in another portion of the constitution

Article I Section  The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect
taxesto pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL
WELFARE of the United States

I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
said in the preamble

Just to make sure you've got the point let's do a little experiment  What
if the constitution read as follows

Preamble We the people to promote the general Welfare do ordain
          and establish this Constitution for the United States of
          America

Constitution  The Federal Government shall have one function and one
               function only  to provide for the defense of the nation


But as noted above the constitution doesn't say that does it

The government would not then have two functions defense and Welfare  

But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
in Article I Section  I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
functions  Right

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees
 
Lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really

why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance


And maybe that's not such a good thing I also read somewhere that
it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health 
systemclass action suits are nearly impossible and you can't sue
the provincial health officials at all

Since our doctors are private and the system is just an insurance
plan litigation would not involve the insurance fund  Our lawyers
do not work on contingency so that if you were to sue for malpractice
then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees  likewise
if you were a doctor and subject of a suit it's time to sweat

Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented the politicallybent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service

Oh no Don't let the AMA know about this They have enough power as it 
is Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get 
more powerful

A few weeks ago the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to
the NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash
This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked
organizations and he would not have done it without the approval 
of his AMA cronies

Well yeah tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside
Ottawa  Theoretically it's limited to service personnel but some
studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients
there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't urgent
at all

It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital  since
not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff
that others don't  Ottawa's population is only a quarter million
if you include the surrounding counties

The problem is in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are
approved by the government how do you keep political considerations
out of medical decisions  I bet that if you're an MP or MPP or good
friends with one you're put on any hospital's urgent care list no
matter how minor your problem Which is OK unless you're someone who
gets bumped off the list for some bigshot

People of influence will get their way in any system American or
European  It's the Golden Rule  he who has the gold makes the
rules 

As for annual budgets those are actually annual grants for facilities
eg mops pans etc given to hospitals of which most are private
nonprofit foundations btw I have no problem with having aggressive
forprofit hospitals like the French who use our approach  but in
the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so
their market is much more diverse  The rest has to be made up for
by billings from patients who use their services

WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  
FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS  

In Canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  
care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private  
hospital rooms  so many Canadians do end up buying some private  
insurance A policy to cover all of these things runs about  to   
a month  

Hmm How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage 
of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included 
in the accounting   Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much 
on health care as we do

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield 
the  figure for the US

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse

How  They are collecting premiums  and I'm an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look
more like the real insurance that it is  The private doctors and 
hospitals will still be there after the insurance hypothically
disappears as they were there before it appeared

Bob Rae the second least popular man in Ontario warned Ontarians a
few years ago that if they didn't stop crossborder shopping in such
huge numbers the services they expect from the province just won't
be there in a few years

For one thing I think that Bob Rae is an idiot 

He didn't say so but I knew he meant the OHIP

Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are
a player   he wants to spend our money on other things than the
health insurance  Our high taxes are high for other spending but
health insurance which is separate and optional and it is being 
spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party 

OHIP is just a health insurance plan it does not provide any kind
of health care that is up to you and your private doctors

Would the private insurers take up the slack They'd be under no
obligation to Of course they could eventually make money again 
but if what you say is true they'd be loathe to do so and out of
practice in handling such basic services too

Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
American companies and their parents provide full insurance down
here  Regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV
to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage  The private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage  They run around patting them
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras 
for those people who deserve it

When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance eg neurosurgery versus deluxe
amenities eg having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility  In Quebec
last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan

Again I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that
much power I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers didn't go 
along with the provinces and the federal government years ago because
they knew that there was a good chance of the public system going bust
in the long run and then afterwards they could clean up Okay this 
sort of contradicts what I said higher up But it's another possibility
They'd have an added bonus when arguing against government
involvement in their industryas they could then point to its failure
instead of just citing theoretical principles

I agree  they were in a winwin situation  But right now it seems
that they have won bigger when you look at how full their coffers
are  Friends from my sisters' MBA class were still being flown out
for job interviews individually with insurance firms in London ON
Canada's insurance capitol a la Hartford along with generous expense
privileges this year despite the ongoing postrecession blues

 Of course one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
 power and keeps it circumscribed in a complex society when it is in the 
 interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using 
 government power for their own ends  But apart from that little 
 conundrum


This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good
solution  One approach is simply to try and move political opinion
and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while  Another
approach is to try and amend the constitution  The original
constitution restrained the US government from economic intervention
for  to  years depending on just how one wants to count it
The First Amendment though weakened in many ways still restrains
government particularly state and local even though on many
particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship  I think
libertarians would be happy with another  years of restraint via
an amendment or two not that I think that's likely to happen

Not necessarily Mr Hendricks but other posters seem to see this as
a problem with libertarianism that it cannot be stable  That might
be true but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se  If
a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then
falls apart again we would just be back where we are now  This is
unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held
for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now
but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of
if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus

Lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really

Then why do we really need national health insurance then 
Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down 
on the cost of malpractice insurance

It would if malpractice and defensive medicine were the main
factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs but they aren't

Although Gary is correct in noting that malpracticerelated problems are
greater in the US than Canada they by no means account for the overall
difference in health care costs  They do account for a somewhat larger
portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries

Some facts  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than  of
total health care costs in the US  In  according to a survey of 
physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged
paying  of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance  
Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 
they've declined significantly since then  At the same time health
care costs have increased more than any period in history

As far as defensive medicine is concerned the AMA estimates that its
total impact is about  billion per year  That's about  of the total
current INCREASE in health care costs  and the estimate is from a group
that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine
on health care

As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things however
Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification
of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their
specialties  This would eliminate most if not all frivolous suits
while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave Lebanon when
the Lebanese government can provide guarantees that Israel will not be
attacked from Lebanese soil and when the Syrians leave


 Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
temporary

	The three are very different issues  Israel has stated
repeatedly that it will not give up the whole Golan but may be
willing to give part of it to Syria as part of a peace agreement

	Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the  war
These areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no
legitamate governing body  Citizenship was given to those residents
in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

	Israel should keep control of parts of the West Bank IMHO
The parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge
which contain few arab towns and many suburbs as well as overlooking
the city of Tel Aviv  The Eastern mountain ridge should be
abandonded  This is where most of the arabs live and it is less
militarily relevant  Israel should also maintain a presence in the
Jordan valley

If so for those of you who support it why were so
many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
let's hear it

	There are a number of reasons for people to move they were
not moved but chose to move into disputed areas  Note that since
these moves were made by free willed human beings not settlers I
will address two aspects of your question why the government would
allow or encourage them to move and second why they did move

	The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people
to move across the green line  They included security and politics

	The first reason was security  A large Jewish presense makes
it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate  A Jewish settlements also
act as fortresses in times of war

	A second reason was political  Creating settlements brought
the arabs to the negotiation table  Had the creation of new towns and
cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in
Israel where there was an arab majority  There would have been no
land left that could be called arab

	The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place
changes the face of any peace settlement and restricts what land can
be given away

	Individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons for
doing so  They include financial religious and political reasons

	Many of the communities created were bedroom communities
Suburbs  A house  minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if it
was on the wrong side of the green line  People who moved there
wanted a decent home at a nice price

	Some of the communites created were religious  They built
their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of
the 's and 's  There are communities like this in Hebron Gaza
and all over  There are also communities built near religious sites

OK Phil you're right So far the evidence suggests that Nixon was a victim
of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgustoblob with
a dash of megalomania After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy 
wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism

Unfortunately however we don't have all the evidence So far this nation's
citizens have been privy to about  hours of the total  hours of Nixon's
tapes What's on the rest of those babies Some archivists have alluded that
there is evidence to suggest that Nixon and his cronies including George
Bush were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas

Ask your local DA what the charges are for the above crime


And so I must ask you Phil me putz when all this shit finally comes out
when you and I are old men I would appreciate the privilege of sticking a pole
up your ass and parading you down Main Street with a sign on your chest

I was an Apologist for the American Fascist Regime circa   

How's that for a lovely Brechtian image


There that ought to get a reaction Unless I'm in his killfile this week

 The Selective Service Registration should be abolished  To start with the
 draft is immoral  Whether you agree with that or not we don't have one now
 and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
 with a volunteer army than with draftees  Finally the government has us
 on many lists in many computers the IRS Social Security Admistration and
 Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to
 Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
 Let's axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit

	More gridlock talk from another relic of the past  The
Selective Service system creates jobs and is an investment in 
the future of americaand whats wrong with that

	We need jobs because at this point in the recovery the economy
should have generated  billion jobs and since it has not the
government has to step in and help  Shutting down selective service
would cost good jobs and we can't do that  

	What we really need is to involve selective service in a more
closely directed manner  We need the selective service involved
in environmental protection highspeed rail commuter aircraft 
civil rights national service and health care  Every dollar
we put into selective service now will get us  less spending
in future

	I really believe now to think about it that selective service
is longpast due for the creation of a cabinet position


	Your not beyond hope just get back on america's side and
start doing your part for change  What Bill needs from you
now is support for the economic stimulus and health care reform
You need to devote all your energies to fighting gridlock and
supporting change  Get on the team  After all the evil has
been banished from washington and the time for complaint 
is past being neccessary

	And remember Bill Clinton cares  He may someday even have
a town meeting in your city  If your an appropriate sort of 
person if you phrase your questions properly and show the
proper respect and awe you might have the chance to ask Mr
President your question in person

   I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial
and repression and should acknowledge such The United States with
its people have recognized that repression has taken place with the
loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional
protections of citizens This recognition has taken the form of the
civil rights law let's just discuss the federal level for now such
as  USC  et seq  USC  et seq et al
   With this recognition of repression at times manifested in the
form of collective guilt I want people to recognize denial 
Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more
crimes in the United States because white people are a majority
it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate
amount of crime in the United States in their relation to their
numbers in population
   My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer
in a large metropolitan area and of a citizen Unless people
account for their behavior and for the behavior of their immediate
community nothing will improve

Well you know that you're getting somewhere when you start getting
responses like this

Kent let me explain it to you

If you are paying for a phone and you don't want callwaiting YOU DON'T
NEED TO PAY FOR CALlWAITING

This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous because it has exposed a real scam

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

There are basic services and there are optional services Dennis Call 
waiting is an optional service but having the number  work on one's phone
is a basic service Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the 
on his phone since none of the numbers he calls has a  in it doesn't mean 
that he has the right to demand that the phone company unbundle the charges
for the use of each phone digit an unbundling that would be horrendously
inefficient because of all the billing  bookkeeping overhead Similarly 
abortion can be seen as a basic service

Furthermore public funding of abortion SAVES money as well as being in the 
views of a substantial portion of the population probably a clear majority 
an ethical thing to do If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that 
way why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities 
with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion If every prolifer did 
the same it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which 
would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion Then you 
would get your wish And you know what No prochoicer I know would stop
you carrying out that plan They might even HELP you with it

that never seems to occur


I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place  Constant
combat isn't particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing  Also
they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway

communism was the hostility of surrounding capitalist nationsUh huh

Steve  you're the one who suggested that a failed government should be an 
ideal proving ground  I never felt that way in the first place  Quite the 
contrary  I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already

took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

I'm curious why you think that particular adjective is important

I'm curious why you took a beign statement and crossposted it to several
different news groups including something along the lines of 
altdiscrimination  

Exsqueeze me  I saw your original post in altdiscrimination
Your post was crossposted to three groups  My followup was crossposted
to two of those three omitting socmotss

Now instead of engaging in metadiscussion off the topic could you answer 
the question posed  If your statement is so beign you should have no
trouble politely responding to a polite query

       Well I don't think your query was exactly polite but I will TRY to
give you a polite responce  Something atypical of the net but here it goes

       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr King  From many
of the newspaper radio and tv news reports I have seen this adjective      
is commonly in front of his name  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner  I did not say that
Mr King was a no good black  I do not know Mr King and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect  I used it PURELY as a 
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many  most  news people have
used it in the past


      The entire second trial was about race Ted  I don't feel compelled to
discuss Mr King's racial background but had Mr King been white there would
not have been a second trial  You probably are saying that the beating would
not have occurred if he were white but that is an extremely difficult call
to make  It is possible the case but not definately  

      I still think your actions are crap Ted  They are far more divisive than
me using the adjective 'black' in a nonderogenory manner  Would you have
been happier if I had used 'Africanamerican'   If so then you really are
lost in the world of PC  You have already been instrumental in getting one
persons net access revoked and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my 
message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting

     The way you went about this 'polite' inquiry makes me believe it was 
anything but

Summary Feasibility considered
NewsSoftware VAXVMS VNEWS     

In article Apriscbriscbrcom stevehthoriscbrcom Steve Hendricks writes
 
I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option  No one suggests that
such analysis should be left to regulators  In fact the reinventing
government movement provides just such a costbenefit approach to the
analysis of public spending  Libertarians would do well to learn more
about it 



Okay  let me try to explain this

When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or  worse yet  a President
one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover
all issues for  or  years  As such  one's influence is highly diluted
I might add that  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations
the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation
combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference  would
make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision
with respect to specific regulations     
 
 
Sorry but it strikes me that it is the only feasible approach  What is
not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and 
licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent
tasks

I'm not sure what you mean by feasible in this case  Do you mean that
 are impossible in priciple  or merely that it would be undesirable in
fact


Actually the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense

 of the four you saw fit to  mention  and education of minors is always
another possibility  since minors are generally considered not to be
responsible to make their own decisions as adults are

It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
be to a principle of noncoercion the only areas of public spending
that they frequently support involve hiring people with gunshmmm

You say this as if it were surprising  yet in fact a necessary consequence
of libertarian philosophy  All noncoersive functions should be dealt 
with privately  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to
the state are the coersive ones

 
Perhaps you have  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries
frequently generate support by acting as protectors of geezers 
mothers and children  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds
that we don't have much to fear from them do so at their own peril

Much more likely it's drunken teenagers  The groups in questionare more 
likely
to be worse off during and after a revolution than before  In the unlikely
event that you missed my earlier sarcasm  let me say this directly
The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered
defense an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups is
so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration  Do you seriously
dispute this


	I don't want to seem patronizing  but you still seem to be laboring
under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably
intelligent and honest persons like yourself who make the decisions
I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be
ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller  I don't expect you to agree
with me  but you explain why you feel I'm wrong

 tfarrelllynxdacnortheasternedu Thomas Farrell said
 
 A good case A FKING GOOD CASE The defense lawyer asked the victim
 questions like what kind of sexual perversions do you participate
 in  and you think he made a good case
 
 Speaking as someone who's only about six weeks and a  tuition bill
 away from becoming an unemployed slob with a law degree I'd really like
 to see a transcript of this trial  I'd especially like to know what
 happened immediately after the defense attorney asked that question
 assuming that the reports that he did so are accurate I'm not
 accusing Tom Farrell of making anything up but this is the sort of
 case that spawns garbled misquotes false rumors and urban legends like
 tribbles  It'd be nice to think that the prosecutor objected
 irrelevant prejudicial inflammatory take your pick and that the
 judge upheld the objection

I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case  They
were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips  Immediately
after the defense attorney asked the question there was an Objection heard
in the background  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the
objection was upheld  I can't imagine NC is that bad 

 The arresting officer said the bastards told him they did it on
 purpose and hoped the victim would die and you think the defense made
 a good case No wonder we're losing  We're aparently not trying
 to win
 
 Again I'd like to see the transcript I'd read the latter bit of that
 in the news media the arresting officer testifying that one of the
 defendants calmly asked him about the condition of the homo and said
 that he hoped he'd die but this is the first I've heard of the officer
 testifying that one of the defendants actually said that he did anything
 at all let alone that he did it on purpose

This I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on
news stories both during and after the trial  Now the we did it on purpose
thing is stretching I think it was something more likehe had it coming  If
somebody else remebers better than I on this second point feel free to
clarify

 We are wondering why the Clinton administration is having so much
 trouble finding a suitable nominee for the post of Attorney General
 when there is an obviously superior candidate

 We refer of course to Prof Anita Hill

Michael Friedman

 Probably because if they pick her the Republicans will investigate
 the rumors that she sometimes returned papers to her students with
 a couple of pubic hairs inserted between the pages

 While I'm hardly one of Prof Hill's biggest fans I find this hard
 to believe

 Could you please supply with a post preferably some proof of this
 ie newspaper articles documenting such allegations etc

Well your ignorance about this is unsurprising given you're a
Canadian  And I'm at a complete loss at to why you should be so
interested in this given that it is an American issue which should
properly be of absolutely no concern to you at all

Actually my interest in gender issues is not limited to international
boundaries  Indeed I often exchange information with Americans about
issues which concern us in both countries


In any event in
answer to your question the following is taken from David Brock's
article The Real Anita Hill published in the March  issue of
TheAmericanSpectator  This is taken from page 
 

Ahsomeone had mentioned this journal but gave no further information


     But the most bizarre incident is alleged to have happened in the
   school year  at Oral Roberts University according to a
   sworn affidavit dated October   and filed with the Senate
   Judiciary Committee in which Lawrence Shiles now a lawyer in
   Tulsa recounted the following

     Shortly after the class had begun Professor Hill gave us a
     written assignment which I completed and duly turned in  When
     this assignment was passed out to the class after having been
     marked by the professor sitting next to me were fellow
     students Jeffrey Londoff and Mark Stewart  Upon opening the
     assignments and reviewing our grades and comments made by Anita
     Hill I found ten to twelve short black pubic hairs in the pages
     of my assignment  I glanced over at Jeff Londoff's assignment
     and saw similar pubic hairs in his work  At the time I made the
     statement to Londoff that either she had a low opinion of our
     work or she had graded our assignment in the bathroom  Mark
     Stewart overheard the conversation and said that he had similar
     pubic hairs in his assignment also  This became the standing
     joke among many students for the remainder of the year in
     classes

     Other students in that class confirmed the story  Londoff says
   he couldn't be certain that the hairs were pubic but he said he
   thought it was unlikely that they could have come from Hill's head
   since they were short coarse and curly and Hill had had the hair
   on her head straightened  Another student who saw the hair but
   did not want to be identified said of its origins You just know
   when you see it

Does this satisfy you

Yes thank you though I am really curious as to why this never came out
at least not in what I saw up here in Canada or on CNN which is sent
up here during the Thomas nomination hearings  Surely one would think
that her claim to having been sexually harassed would have a great deal
less credibility if it could be shown that she had herself been guilty of it


or do you regard sworn statements given to a
US Senate committee as equivalent to toilet paper

Ahemmm  It depends  

For instance if it were the sworn statements at the Warren Commission
then yes I would say that the statements were no better than toilet
paper used at that  but in most cases the answer would be no

Okay  let me try to explain this

When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or  worse yet  a President
one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover
all issues for  or  years  As such  one's influence is highly diluted
I might add that  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations
the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation
combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference  would
make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision
with respect to specific regulations     

I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here  I didn't suggest that all 
government regulations be subject to referenda  So I don't follow the 
comments above

 
 
Sorry but it strikes me that it is the only feasible approach  What is
not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and 
licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent
tasks

I'm not sure what you mean by feasible in this case  Do you mean that
 are impossible in priciple  or merely that it would be undesirable in
fact

I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally
undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw
support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate

Furthermore I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an
industrial society because the weight of litigation andor misery it
would produce would effectively crush productive effort


Actually the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense
It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
be to a principle of noncoercion the only areas of public spending
that they frequently support involve hiring people with gunshmmm

You say this as if it were surprising  yet in fact a necessary consequence
of libertarian philosophy  All noncoersive functions should be dealt 
with privately  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to
the state are the coersive ones

No I'm not surprised  I just think it's interesting that on one hand
libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed yet on the other
posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns  I realize
that many libertarians assume that such a government will be 
counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry but it is worth noting that
widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the
establishment of totalitarian government eg Iraq

 
Perhaps you have  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries
frequently generate support by acting as protectors of geezers 
mothers and children  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds
that we don't have much to fear from them do so at their own peril

Much more likely it's drunken teenagers  The groups in questionare more 
likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before  
In the unlikely
event that you missed my earlier sarcasm  let me say this directly
The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered
defense an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups is
so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration  Do you seriously
dispute this

Yup sure do  But since I also support the constitutional requirement
that the government provide for the general welfare Article I section 
I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis


	I don't want to seem patronizing  but you still seem to be laboring
under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably
intelligent and honest persons like yourself who make the decisions
I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be
ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller  I don't expect you to agree
with me  but you explain why you feel I'm wrong

Well in the first place I don't support a socialized economic system
I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea  But it is not
the case that any third partyisas likely to be ignorant or corrupt
as the buyer or seller  There are multitudes of examples where such a
statement is demonstrably false  Regulation of stock market transactions
that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one
example

 My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer in a large

 behavior and for the behavior of their immediate community nothing
 will improve

Wait a minute  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility
for their own behavior I assume that's what you meant by the word
account but also for the behavior of their immediate community

First of all how immediate are you talking about and secondly I
have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
accounting for the actions of a different person

Actually I bet you more gaybi men are as not as promiscuous as gay men 
because more of them could have the option of living a straight life and 
with social pressures probably would at least try

   Geez where have you been Ryan  I proposed this theory months
ago  Let's take it one step further even  If as the surveys show
up to  of all men have had a homosexual encounter then there must
be an even larger percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
fantasies  But if less than  of the population is gay what can we
say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated
gay potential  Obviously a large chunk of these people chose or
more accurately were forced to choose by force of religion and social
sanction to put those feelings aside to be heterosexual

   Obviously Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category

   These people are the ones who are so hung up on choice
Obviously since they chose everyone must have and homosexuals are
just flaunting their perversion by choosing not to go along with what
society has dictated

   Of course I'm that most awful of perverts  I chose I gleefully
admit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and chose to
indulge in my homoerotic potential  Take that

William If the reason that this country still stands after  years

  Here let me give a remedial course in thinking

     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates Uncle Sam
     has shifted his debt from longterm to shortterm securities

     In effect Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into
     one giant SL waiting to blow

     Shortterm rates rise   Interest payments on Deficit rise 
     Uncle Sammy has to borrow more   Causing Shortterm rates to rise

     Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop  His options

       i Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount
       ii  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts

    Results of i  large numbers of pissedoff citizens

    of communication newtworks to foster a nationwide grassroots

How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives on

took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

I'm curious why you think that particular adjective is important

       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr King  From many
of the newspaper radio and tv news reports I have seen this adjective      
is commonly in front of his name  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner  I did not say that
Mr King was a no good black  I do not know Mr King and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect  I used it PURELY as a 
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many  most  news people have
used it in the past

No one is questioning whether Mr King is black  The question arises
whether King's race should make police officers afraid as hell  Your
statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for
large black guys than for just large guys in general  

That two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use
of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use

     If all choices should have federal funding so poor people can afford
them
then shouldn't firearms be federally subsidized  After all it is the
people
in the ghettoes who are most affected by the proliferation of weapons among
criminals  Shouldn't they have federal funding so they can protect         s
themselve
and their families from inner city criminals

Criminals mostly  get steal their guns from people who buy them
legally  In order to reduce the number of guns criminals use you'd
need to to reduce and not increse the number of legally held guns

     Wrong NYC subway breath  Criminals are going to have guns regardless
of what legislative remedy you come up with  However it is the lawabiding
citizens who suffer when guns are harder to obtain  Case in point
Washington
DC is the murder capital of the US but has banned handguns and has some
of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation  They ain't working
big brother Ray

They don't work because you need a nationwide confiscation of all guns
Ralphie That's why it dosen't work in DC They didn't confiscate the guns
that all ready exist Therefore what Ray said still applies

 If only we could keep guns
out of criminals hands we would just have a bunch of citizens getting
stabbed
choke and beaten to death

However Ralphie the amount of killings would go down Think about it With
guns it just takes the pull of a trigger Other forms of murder require much
more effort on the part of the murderer





In the UK I read recently that some young women
have been killing even without guns which are nearly impossible to obtain
there and it is a cause of great concern to the Brits  Wellarmed citizens
mean that this country will never fear from the government criminals or
invasion  We may have twice the murder rate of the UK but who gives a flip

You should Although maybe you're right Well armed citizens wouldn't have
to worry about little boys and their threats against women and abortion
clinics

Why should we want to compare our society which is extremely heterogeneous and
wealthy to one that is basically homogeneous and in dire straits

Ralphie ever been to London or any major city in the UK You know not what
you speak And as far as England being in dire straits have you forgotten
your lines about civil wars and society erupting in the US

 What about
Japan  If Americans were willing to give some of the Draconian punishments
that the Japs are perhaps we wouldn't need guns  Or the Germans  They have
a th century history of being extremely reactionary so guns or no guns
those
suckers know how to take care of bih'ness

Do you have a point here Except to explain the crap that follows

     Point is Raymeister that America is violent  And to put up in an OhSo
DarwinianManner the toughest on this planet survive  Not the GoodPeople
tm
but the tough ones  The top  nations in GNP in the world are Japan Germany
and the US  All these countries have a violent tradition  Pure coincidence
I doubt it

Ralphie only you in your sick mind would think that this is the reason Japan
and Germany's GNP are two of the highest Probably had more to do with the
economic rebuilding after World War II I think you need to study the issue
a little more But in Ralphie's World violence is to be worshipped Isn't it

     I am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there
are  Such arguments are basically worthless imho  Would it 
really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly
denied access to housing employment and personal security or
even only one  
    As for death threats I happen to know from personal
experience that gay people are far more likely to receive
them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies
related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex
uals Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friends
is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to
be gay  
     Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under
our current form of government in theory yet every day 
gay people are victimized by their local governments by
the police force and by for the most part an uninformed
and ignorant public Is this democracy I don't think so
   A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of
the treatment of the people who make up that society
All of those people And yes that includes gays lesbians
and bisexuals whose crimes have no victims and who
are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are

No social problem however great is worth destroying the freedom in America

The destruction of freedom is never an answer to any social problem

You can't even walk down the street at night alone in America because of drug
s
Freedom my ass

Ryan

Why exactely can't you walk down the street safely  It it because somebody
will jump out from behind a shadow and SELL YOU DRUGS  Hardly

Or mug me
  On the
other hand it's certainly possible that you are walking down the steet of
a bustling lawless part of your metropolitan area  Lawless and bustling read
underground economy

Why must you pursue this fantasy that all crime is derived from underground 
economies

  There it may not be a very safe place to be at all
Unless of course you're there to buy some drugs

I explained how the WOD is a major cause of largescale crime in America  The
head of the Guardian Angles agrees with me legalize drugs and watch violent
 
Haaahaaaahaaaa

crimes significantly decrease

As for me well I think I'll go take a walk tonightalone  I feel safe  I
just hope the FDAFBIDEABATF isn't back at my apartment confiscating all my
property because they found my phone number written on a phone booth that was
also used by a drug dealer 

Yeah buddy this happens all the time  Tell me HAS IT EVERY REALLY HAPPENED 
TO YOU   That's what I thought

 In that sense I don't feel safe  I'm an honest
lawabiding citizen drug laws included FTM why is it that I fear the
government more than I fear criminals


Your foolish

Freedom MY ass  This is NOT what the founding fathers some of whom would be
thrown in prison under today's drug laws had in mind  All of these problems
you come up with pale in comparison to the fact that the very fiber of our
countrythe US Constitutionis being destroyed  What good would it do
          
Must I ask again what part

even IF the WOD actually reduced crime we just created a new class of
criminals headed up the gang's current leader Bill Clinton  The DEA etc
are private armies that answer directly to the president  They possess
advanced weapons and survailance technology  Does this sound familiar to
anybody

Do you support Mein Furher Clinton  Hmmmmmm  You seem to have come out
against the current adminstration why are you eager to endow it with
even MORE power  Power of the most dangerous kind too


All I ask is that drugs stay illegal  I don't think it's too much to ask

Funny but I've seen a LOT more than  or  seconds of that video and
I still think the police involved were guilty I don't think there's any
excuse they could POSSIBLY come up with that would make what they did
OK I don't care if Rodney King was satan himself there's just no
excuse Now whether they did it because he was black or they did it
because they wanted to beat up on somebody they were arresting is
another entirely separate question that I have insufficient information
to make any kind of conclusion about
 
 
        How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives o

 the line day in and day out who are afraid as hell of a large black guy that
 took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  Oh yeah did you watch
 the start of the video when King got UP out of his prone postion and charge
 the cops  Sorry the video cuts both was when you sit and watch it start to
 finish
 
 

I have to agree with you the police may have carried it a bit too far
but Rodney King was no angel either And I don't think ANY guilty
verdicts should have been returned I'm sure you know why they handed
down guilty verdicts on two of the officers It's quite simple really
it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities
think it's right to riot I hate to say this but I would have liked to
see them riot with everyone prepared It would be open season if your
skin was even slightly brown

Just a couple of questions for the proIsraeli lobby out there

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary  For Mr
Stein  I am working on a proof for you that Israel is diverting
water to the Jordan River away from Lebanese territory

Israel has made it quite clear that it has absolutely no desire to
keep any Lebanese territory and will leave completely after a peace
treaty is signed and Lebanon gains control of its own country from
Syria and controls the terrorists launching strikes against Israel
from Lebanon

Considering this it obviously would be pointless for Israel to be
working on diverting water away from Lebanese territory

 Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
temporary  If so for those of you who support it why were so
many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
let's hear it

Who gets to keep what parts of Judea and Samaria will be determined in
a peace settlement  Obviously Israel will keep some and the Arabs
will get some

Israel has tried to get out of Gaza almost from the time it got stuck
with it  It has been refused by the Arabs several times  Although
there are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up I
seriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in any
settlement

The Golan Heights is a serious security problem and Israel obviously
will have to keep part of it and give up part of it  One should
remember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was to
be in Britain's Palestine Mandate slated to become part of the Jewish
state until Britain traded it to France for other considerations  In
other words it is an historical accident that it was ever part of
Syria

In article APRvenustamuedu gmwvenustamuedu Mr Grinch writes

Steve  you're the one who suggested that a failed government should be an 
ideal proving ground  I never felt that way in the first place  Quite the 
contrary  I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already
had a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression  yet had a
strong spirit of individualism and initiative  Someplace like Texas 

Mr Grinch  
 

 
And while Texas taxpayers might willingly eliminate taxsupport for UT
and TAMU I'm not sure they'd support gutting the football programs

Football can pay for itself


Then there's the impact on Ross Perot's fortune of eliminating the various
state supported programs where he's made his money

Why  He's already made it  Sure nodoby else will be able to bilk
the public in the same specific ways  but why should he or I care


 
All in all Texas doesn't seem to be a very likely place for
libertarianism to take hold 
 
More likely than most places  When I was there the most important 
state issue was whether to have a state income tax or instead legalize
a popular vice for fund raising  and vice won a decisive victory

jsh

Mr Grinch

ps  Now that he's safely dead  I expect David Koresh to become the
hero of popular folk ballads  and the ATF to be generally equated with
Santa Anna

I couldn't disagree with you more strongly  It sounds good but in
practice it too often becomes tyranny because there are too often
conflicting ideas of what constitutes improving the human condition
Far better to let people and their organizations pursue whatever goals
they think best and let the human condition be improved by those who
are willing to do so without coercion

There will always be conflicting ideas on what constitutes improving the
human condition that's humanity You seem to believe that libertarianism
will improve the human condition by lifting all constraints and that
people will have a better chance of improving themselves in that environment
 
Let me try to put it another way  Libertarians believe that an
unconstrained environment provides the best chance of solving any
problem because it maximizes creativity  However there is never
any guarantee that a really good solution will ever be found to any
particular problem  Utopia is not an option

Utopia is a myth although we can do a lot better than what we have today
But I think that you must pitch Libertarianism as a progressive agenda
ie You can do better under our style of system

        I admire a lot of what the Libertarians stand for but you
guys are some of the worst salesmen I have ever seen And when it comes to
politics you need salesmen whether you want them or not
 
What we need are more people who agree with us know something
about marketin and are willing to both do that marketing and teach
others how to  Are you in

I'm flattered by your invitation but I'm afraid you have the wrong person
Although I completely agree with your civil liberties agenda I'm not 
in support of your economic agenda What I DO like about the Libertarian
party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the
past I encourage you guys to continue your crusade but I'm afraid I
can't ride along

 It was interesting to watch the  club today  Pat Robertson said that the
 Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god He
 also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it

I don't necessarily agree with Pat Robertson  Every one will be placed before
the judgement seat eventually and judged on what we have done or failed to do
on this earth  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship
Worship of money is one of the greatest religions in this country

I do agree that it was a terrible tragedy and yes the FBI blew it
 
 However I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
 world had a similarly humble 'cultstatus' beginning even and perhaps
 especially christianity  

Cult status maybe but they didn't have to take up arms to protect themselves
As you may recall the early Christians were pacifists preferring to avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner  Why else
do you think the apostles were thrown into jail so often and beaten up for the
sake of their beliefs

 It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
 Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled  

Selffulfilled  I heard that Koresh was predicting that the FBI would be the
ones to burn  It doesn't take any great insight to light yourself on fire maybe
perverse delusion

 Maybe David
 Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
 new major religion to me
  

NOT  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world for a brief
moment in time  Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the
FBI Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers  Sick and    sad

 Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who
 is next  The Mormons or Jews

Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get
                                 
You are making a ludicrous suggestion

As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

  I don't think it's too far off of the mark either  No one 'deserves' what
they get  Punishment is for the justice system flawed as it may be  This
whole 'well it served the idiots right' mentality is nothing but a revenge
mentality and my opinion is that revenge is for children and the emotionally
retarded Frank Herbert 'Dune' series

Please allow me to explain myself  In  the governor of Missouri
governor Boggs issued his socalled Mormon extermination order  The
only crime illegal activity the Latterday Saints had committed was
their religious affiliation their antislave stance Missouri still
allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in Missouri

  Well every group has a somewhat selective memory of it's past  Even the
protestants who look to Martin Luther for starting the whole movement
conveniently forget his diatribes telling nobles to slaughter the peasants
who rebelled against unjust conditions

I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow
to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience
brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements

  They stood up for what they believed in and the people of the time hated
them for that and because they were different  Xenophobia has always been
one of the strongest reasons for death and destruction

 more about mormon oppression deleted
  when we tried to organize socreligionmormon andor
talkreligionmormon a whole bunch of charitable believers effectively
blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism
et al in an appropriate forum  We really must be a threat to various
establishments

  Anyone who's confident in what they believe should not have a problem
listening to dissenting points of view  It's something called 'free speech'
which radicals usually push aside in favour of doing what's 'right'

  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa
tion also belongs in the category of persecution  It is ironic that those
who oppose us point to all kinds of justifications to do so despite
their claims of adhering to a gospel of love

 Ahh I agree with that most strongly  Who cares about 'claims'  All I
want to see are actions  If you act like you hate me you probably do all
pieinthesky religious affiliations to the contrary

Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government I do but NOT without
questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
resolves

  Yes  Most people don't realize that it's NOT some 'government' sitting
in a faraway magical land that makes decisions it's people  And those
people make mistakes like any human  Questioning the government in everything
it says and does should be one of our most fundamental rights

  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

  Until this all settles I'm not sure anyone can make that sort of blanket
statement  Sure they may have been quiet peaceloving people who just
happened to be armed to the teeth but who knows what David Koresh had planned

Please explain  I do not remember Jews or Mormons as a group overtly
breaking a judicious aka nonNazi law and being punished for it
ReadYourHistory  It HAS happened as explained above in some detail
and will undoubtedly happen again Indeed WHO IS NEXT  Socalled Illegal
activities can be twisted and bend to suit anyone's need including the
agendas of secular authorities

  You don't even have to break laws to get punished as I'm sure many people
have found out  What about the drug laws that permit the police to seize
any suspect goods  And some grandmother travels with  in cash in her
handbag doesn't trust the banks it falls open and the police end up
confiscating it  This is not an isolated case either

  Or laws to stop companies from making lookalike FordGM car parts and
selling them as the real thing  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 's cars

  All I'm saying is that it should NOT be assumed that someone is inherently
eviletc when the government decides to nail them

  It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in
everything for them who are really dangerous

In addition it is ridiculous for this Hicks guy from the FBI saying that
they were just trying to bring them before the bar to face justice when
who should really be on trial is every officer involved in the brainless
BATF assault  Granted it would be tough to convict when the bodies were

the gross incompetence and disregard for human life displayed by the ATF

As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

Please allow me to explain myself  In  the governor of Missouri
governor Boggs issued his socalled Mormon extermination order  The
only crime illegal activity the Latterday Saints had committed was
their religious affiliation their antislave stance Missouri still
allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in Missouri

I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow
to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience
				   
brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements

It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
average people and that at the time almost all Americans were pretty
homogeonously Christian  It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust
at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred

The situation is not entirely different today  Many irrational feelings and
beliefs are justified through religion  I don't think most of them are started
because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate
prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages
critical thought

In any regard Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from
being trusted or righteous  Have things really changed for the better  I
may be a born cynic but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case In the early s I believe the late President Kimball lds church
leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MXPeace Keeper
missile maze from being built in Utah yet another inspired decision from
secular authorities  Fortunately his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off

Do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of
people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassingeradicating the
Mormons  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
nuclear testing etc was to get them thar Mormons  And what about the
majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons  You seem to be searching for enemy
conspiracies  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly
must have been done primarily for that purpose

  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with
John I too wonder who or what's next

I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
life of even one person  Sure he did not pose a threat to the security of
this nation  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers  That
much is definite

Who killed who  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound
What REALLY caused the murder of the little children  Could it be that
the ATFFBI presence has any bearing upon the events  How would you
interpret the Mt Masada events  Blame the Jews  What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway  What business did the ATFFBI has in Waco
Texas  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
team in   In that case the police botched the job as well  But to
lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake
I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case  Certainly if David
Koresh chose any peaceful option the ATF and FBI would have complied  The
responsibility is more his than the authorities

David Koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the
executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers

Characterizing the ATFFBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair  In order
to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent to kill

A short comment
As you may recall the early Christians were pacifists preferring to
avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner

The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city
Despite some pious legends the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
especially after centuries of political instability and terror the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology Acts is eerily familiar especially today

 	A few weeks ago I found out about some of the politics that
 is going on with the Texas bullet train and was appalled at some
 of the apparent underhanded tactics to push this thing through
 without any public say whatsoever  So I wrote up a short 
 editorial thing and posted it hoping to get some discussion
 
 I suppose editorials don't do it here  So now I am asking for 
 the general opinion of the net about the proposed high speed 
 train
 
 What do you think  I personally think it is a stupid idea and
 that there are a few people somewhere who are going to get very
 rich from this deal
 

My opinion is this  In a society whose economy is primarily based on 
capitalism the role of government should be to provide those goods and 
services that need providing for the general public's good  BUT government 
should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible 
for a private enterprise or individual to make money from providing them
I agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make 
money and will rely heavily on State tax dollars  

The question I think then becomes  Do we the general public need the train

I certainly do not nor will I ever need this train in Lubbock Texas  With
the inexpensive air travel provided between Dallas and Houston I don't think
people in Dallas or Houston need it either

 Look at the whole picture not just
 randomly picked libertarian positions  If government is not allowed to
 use noninitiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest
 can influence the government to use noninitiated force on their behalf

Either the government has force available to it or it doesn't  The
Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone
else uses force first  even when that first force is not directed
against the government but one of its citizens  That all being true 
what safeguards do we have against the government CLAIMING that some
initiation of force on its part is really a response  Like the burning
of the Maine the Tonkin Gulf incident or the assault on Waco

I ask this not to argue but to understand

 All the liberals on this newsgroup that think morality should not be
 legislated need to stuff it I'll take morality over the drug plague
 the AIDS plague the kids shooting kids in school the pedophilers the
 explosion in child abuse that is happening now etcetera etcetera 
 those things are tangible All that liberal feelgood bs about We
 can't legislate morality because well well just because needs
 to find the fastest route back to its homeland RUSSIA and Marxism

	Hmmmlet's see here  the drugs in question are illegal
kids shooting kids actually people shooting people is illegal 
sex with children is illegal child abuse is illegal etcetera etcetera
Yep it sure looks like the legislation of your morality is working like
a charm

 Uh people have killed in the name of God too though this century
 has proven that no Holy war can quite match the bloodlust of
 antireligious Marxism Examples The USSR  million adult born
 people killed various political purges etc China xx million killed
 since Mao Tsu Tung first painted their land Red and for China they're
 still killing the list goes on All these countries banned religion
 and promised their people a Utopia when they were freed from God But
 that still doesn't erase the fact that they took their title of
 TheWorld'sMostBloodthirsyInstitution out of the hands of none other than
 the religious faithful who had held it for  years before that
 Hell even Hitler couldn't top what Stalin did in Russia but until
 recently no one has been willing to discuss that much so by default
 Hitler remains the model dictator and villain when in fact Stalin was
 much his superior in that awful deplorable sense

	So religion and totalitarianism seem to be kissin' cousins
I'll pass on both thank you kindly

 
 The use of God does NOT NECESSARILY MEAN the killing will stop Please
 consider that

	The use of Gawd seems to encourage killing  
 
 
I want the phrase under God removed from our pledge also  God
doesn't deserve that insult
 
 Oh yeah and you better stop using money because In God We Trust can
 be found on the back of the dollar bill

	And you'll stop buying food when the mark of the beast is 
required eh

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to

It is always cheaper to kill children than to take responsibility for

I never understood why Canadians Mexicans Brazilians etc accusing

Not few Europeans think of you all as Americans and of the US as

It would not be surprising that a continent that produced fascism communism 
and two world wars might have quite a few people who tend to think of other
people as trash that should be extinguished sooner or later  I seem to 
remember a gut called  Hitler who felt the same way One wonders what would be
the fate of Europe if God had extinguished this nation of blasphemeous trash
before  Not that I believe in gods  How many millions of people through
out the world would have to die because no force could stop the insane bloody
European imperialism Thankfully the imperialistic US helped put an end to 
these games so that the rest of the world can sleep alittle more safely Thus I 
could care less what not few Europeans think so long as they can't do anything 
about it

In article Apriscbriscbrcom stevehthoriscbrcom Steve Hendricks writes
 you don't specify the means through which the government
 is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests  As a 
 leftwing big government conventional liberal I'm just as willing as
 you are to vote against anticompetitive regulations that favor auto
 dealers  
 
 But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms
 to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws
 and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay  Each strikes me as a 
 particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
 interests cannot influence public policy  In fact they seem clearly
 designed to accomplish the opposite

If government is not allowed to
use noninitiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest
can influence the government to use noninitiated force on their behalf

Fine  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable
with the use of state sponsored coercion  The notion that coercion can
be virtually eliminated in a society or more properly that once it is
eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious 
consideration is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists  

For example does noninitiated force coercion include tax collection
Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned
by Adam Smith  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the
state how is the state to deal with it  Exclusively through after the
fact arbitrationlegal compulsion  


The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which I'll address briefly  It certainly won't happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy  Statists run the education
monopoly so we have to be creative  The Advocates for SelfGovernment
reports  of their Seminar  participants embrace libertarianism
That's the best means I've seen yet  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar  attendance  in jest

Well I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants
is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a 
complex conflictual industrial society  I'd venture to point out 
however that if libertarians couldn't convince at least  of a group 
of seminar participants to embrace their philosophy their 
propaganda skills need to be honed  

Frankly however it is no great trick to create a government for a 
society in which almost everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper
government policy  Once that is assumed all sorts of annoying formalities
can be dispensed with elections police etc  And as Mr Marx said
the state will just wither away  

On the way there however would you like to explain how eliminating 
virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the 
current society will help us to live happier lives Or is it like
socialism just some shortterm pain that we'll have to bear until 
everyone has had the benefit of reeducation through regular 
seminar training

But punishing the person for posting such a thing smacks of
authoritarianism

It's a deliberate act of fraud intended to cause harm

You seem to be unclear about the legal meaning of fraud Mere
misrepresentation is not fraud

Your comment here is meant as a put down It fails for several reasons 

 You have edited out the context of the action under discussion 
 I never brought the legal definition up I use the English language
and not the legal dialect The legal definition of fraud changes from
one country to another in any case The context of the discussion is morality
of censorship



How does a posting from your site do any such thing Especially if your
site is a university Do you know any person who believes that a 
university endorses every comment made from a university site

That is why I refered specifically to a company

Good Now do you know any person who believes that a company endorses
every comment made from a university site

You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance
in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case
If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you
thought me you would have done rather better The mode of argument I was using
was a form of rhetoric Argument by example I describe a wide set of
circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they
do not apply thus the action is not permisable

Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed  it
would be contrary to the internet comercial use

Usenet does not distribute letterhead

Organization DESYDeutsches Elektronen Synchrotron Experiment ZEUS bei HERA

I suggest strongly that if you mean for this to be taken as letterhead you
get a better stationery designer 

Now you are clutching at straws In the context of the discussion it was
the fact of association between the company and the post that was important
The typeface etc is inconsequential


There are people on the net who are openly supporting the murder of members
of my family

Sigh

If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick
Staffords posts into socculturebritish If you are suggesting that 
advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it
directly 

Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to
call for the murder of Salman Rushdie Incitement to murder is not part
of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech


As for your notion that employees can argue their different political
views at their own expense could you explain precisely what expense
you're talking about

Internet is not free The connection charges are quite expensive for comercial
concerns

Could you give me a cost breakdown for the expense to your company
attributable to an employee's posting a political view in disagreement
with yours Numbers please

That is irrelevant the case is not the incremental cost but the facility
cost If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe
to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company It is
quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and
regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy For example
if a Microsoft employee were to post Windows NT is crap don't buy it
from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to
sack that employee In the same way if a company decides that it has 
political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political
manner This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political
platform for his views


I was refering to the arrogance of your position quoting the words written
by slave owners at me in the cause of freedom

Which words written by slave owners did I quote I don't recall quoting
anyone

ah yes you did not quote them merely refered to them


Your constitution is not
considered sacrosanct in other parts of the globe 

Nor have I assumed it is I don't consider the First Amendment to have
talismanic value

You might just as well have attempted to argue from the King James bible
to a Muslim I was pointing out that your reasoning is parochial when with
little effort you could have made a substantive point 

I made the effort apparently you made a certain effort to misunderstand
me

Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment your signature
and pretty well damn all else 


For an example of a UK publication that understands this try INDEX ON
CENSORSHIP

I used to subscribe I would still if I was not moving

INDEX regularly publishes opinions by nonAmericans who believe the First
Amendment represents appropriate freespeech principles for all open
societies See eg the opinions of the dissenting law lords in the
SPYCATCHER case

Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments
on the substantive case

The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable
judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be
harmed would be grounds for prior restraint The second set of hearings on the
substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets
act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already
The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate

Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that
information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated
to third parties The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this
case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves 

The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law
The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's
ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book 


You haven't any reason to believe that anything I've said has been reached
unquestioningly

Only most of what you write 

For someone who purports to be opposed to argument from assertion you
certainly get by on assertions a lot

Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made Of course in
rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion since this assertion
is unprovable I left it at that 

So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your
own You are attacking my anticensorship view because I dare to accept the
validity of some procensorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions 
Plus I am not an absolutist I have this funny idea that the solution to this
problem was not decided in  by a group of white male gentry in secret
session and sumarized in a single line Furthermore I don't think that the
issues are half as simple as you imply

You may think that I am being antiAmerican in disallowing recourse to the
first ammendment It's just that this argument has no currency in the parts
of the world where there is state censorship such as Iran Kewait and Israel

I don't pretend to have geared my discourse for all conceivable audiences

I don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that
of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact not
from the fire

	Thoughts

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

On the other hand it would be kind of scary if there were never a final
verdict because a party to litigation could keep saying Oops  I forgot
to bring up this evidence and demand a new trial  You get one bite at
the apple

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed 
Shouldn't that be up to a jury

It's up to General Motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation
You'd be up in arms if a plaintiff suing General Motors pulled the same
stunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost  It's not
as if General Motors couldn't file enough discovery motions to delay the
trial until they found all the witnesses they wanted

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  

Define obvious bias

Shouldn't that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial

Did GM move for a new trial on those grounds  No  Perhaps they had a 
reason

Will Italy be the Next Domino to Fall



Socialism may have collapsed in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Disunion
but it lingers on in Western Europe and the United States It remains
the primary ideology in the hearts and minds of the liberal academia
and media But all the political correctness they can muster may not be
sufficient to hold back the economic forces that threaten to spread
socialism's collapse from the second world to the first Indeed it is
becoming more apparent every day that socialism may not even survive
the turn of the century

Ed of course has never demonstrated remarkable knowlege of socialism 
or any other political system come to that

While the Swedes have already discarded their third way and the
French have made history by turning out the Socialist Party in a 
recordsetting defeat it is Italy that appears most precariously
on the edge of its political existence

That leaves Germany Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the
right wing government is on the verge of collapse Oh and of course the USA
which just elected a socialist government 

Italy today is a basketcase even by European standards It has
introduced  new taxes in  months and publicsector revenue is at or
near the  of GDP mark 

Etc unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right both are
to blame Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal The only 
untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist
separatists and the communist party which has collapsed


In spite of this political gluteny it has
an annual deficit exceeding the sum of all other EC countries and a
public debt  times that of Latin America Italy is understandably
having serious trouble selling its treasury bonds in the markets And
while Italy is an extreme case it is anything but unique all
European governments appear headed in the same direction in spite of
their nominally nonsocialist governments

Unfortunately Europeans being well Europeans it is very unlikely
that they will discover Americanstyle liberty Instead they will
likely lurch from socialism to fascism as quickly as they had moved
from fascism to socialism never pausing along the way to reasseses the
role of government itself I hope I am wrong

Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together
before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget
deficits here None of them are serious on the USA scale

And here in Europe we have zero interest in EdIpser type freed thank you
We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers
for the benefit of the super wealthy We are quite happy with social 
democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably
little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by
socialism

The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education
and health care and provision of the welfare state This has been achieved
across the whole of Europe only the USA is struggling to catch up The
problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded


Nobody ever claimed that the collapse of socialism would be pretty
The decline of the nationstate will probably lead first to anarchy
since politicians always cut essential services before pork Los
Angeles has rampant crime and frantically waits for the next wave of
riots but it has a spanking new subway that nobody wants to use and
which like every other public transit system in the world will never
be economically viable If you were trying to extort tax payers
which would you cut first mass transit or police protection

Ed starts to discus LA presumably he thinks that it is in Europe On
the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city

Thus does the world hurtle toward chaos even as the st century
approaches

Rather the opposite What is happening in Italy is that the communist party
has collapsed This has meant that the grand coalition between right and
left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed The 
magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and 
corruption and have arrested half the politicians The fact that the socialists
are in charge this week is incidental the right is into the corruption just
as baddly

What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much
better in the next election Most of the parliamentary deputies are going
to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people
who are free of any hint of corruption Look out for a parliament of
Pavarotti's and porn stars

Here is a press release from the United States Information Agency

 Digest of Foreign Media Reaction from the United States Information
Agency April   of 
 To National Desk
 Contact Anne Chermak of the United States Information Agency
          

   WASHINGTON April    Following is part one
of a digest of foreign media reaction from April  compiled
by the United States Information Agency

                   TERRORISM AND WORLD INSECURITY

   In recent editorials Iran was universally recognized as
te source of the double threat of statesponsored terrorism
and Islamic extremism  But beyond this fear and condemnation
journalists found little common ground that would compel both
North and South and Arab and nonArab nations to work together
to combat the global threat of terrorism  For example Egyptian
and Algerian papers were in the forefront in charging US complicity
in the current instability in the Middle East  Those commentators
asserted that the United States had promoted Islamic fundamentalism
during the Afghanistan War and had further added to regional
instability by alternately encouraging Iraq and Iran

The cads The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of
course is not mentioned It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms
to Iran it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq

Still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing

   India's papers weighed the pros and cons of helping the West to
identify Pakistan's role in promoting terrorism noting on the one
hand that doing so could bring ruination to Islamabad's Kashmir
cause but on the other could also bring India's security apparatus
uncomfortably close to the CIA and the Mossad  Arab papers continued
to portray Iraq and Libya as being unfairly treated by the UN while
Israel remains unpunished for resolutions which it has violated

In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided
that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with
damascus during the gulf war One day the US is certain that its Syria
the next Lybia For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to
Lybian courts for extradition proceedings Faced with similar demands the
USA would reject them as would any other country


   Concerning Northern Ireland President Clinton's message of
consolation to the victims of the Warrington bombing was seen in
British tabloids as signalling a tougher stance by the American
government against violence by the IRA

The word is terrorism


The problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an
image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests
then comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a
fitting combination of the words freedom dignity democaracy or
of terrorism dictatorship etc as appropriate

The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran The people there are
rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they
loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack 
Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be
the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be
movement it would be easier for the USA to move

First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the
IranIraq war Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil
production back up to capacity would also be a smart move at the moment 
Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling If they had extra capacity they would
use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests

The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment 
simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating They also need
western technology

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expectsfears one might need
If one is opposed to abortion one should not be required to pay for
coverage of it because one will NEVER want to use that service and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder  

Overriding any concern about morality is the fact that men Dennis
is a man's name don't get abortions  Thus it is unreasonable to 
suppose that YOUR insurance premiums are being used for the 
possibility that you will be getting an abortion

It looks like what you're really objecting to is other people paying
money for the possibility that THEY might need to get an abortion

 calling for federally funded abortions is that many private

Well you know that you're getting somewhere when you start getting
responses like this

Kent let me explain it to you

If you are paying for a phone and you don't want callwaiting YOU DON'T
NEED TO PAY FOR CALlWAITING

This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous because it has exposed a real scam

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder
for reasons of conscience  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all
anymore then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for abortion
coverage if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs  Or are we
going to start forcing Jews to eat pork Quakers to fight in wars etc

No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto loyalty oath in support of
abortion in order to gain access to health care ESPECIALLY if one's
conscience is so obviously against the practice of abortion

You can't because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these

Along with normalized relations with the PRC

Normalizing relations with Cambodia You must be joking We sponsored
the OVERTHROW of the Cambodian government After repeated failed attempts
of course 

Your sad level of historical and political knowlege is probably best
exemplified by the fact that you think PRC stands for Cambodia instead

Candidate Clinton promised to tax the rich and most folks thought that
was a pretty nifty idea  Then President Clinton said he wanted families
who make more than  to bear  of the new tax burden and many
were quick to complain that their sixfigure income does not make them one
of the welltodo  It's particularly ironic to me that it's in those
traditionally liberal enclaves of the Bay Area and academia where the
wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of just
regular workingclass folk

Nobody will ever admit to being rich everybody's middle class  So who
are The Rich  Well I'll throw out some stats from the  Census and

Hum I guess this has some significance as opposed to having an incredible

murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expectsfears one might need

If that's true then it's a reasonable assumption that a person named
Dennis will never need an abortion and therefore you're already
not paying for it so what's your problem

Welcome to the conservative judiciary

the governor is feeling charitable

There's a guy on death row in Texas that was denied a new trial dispite
evidence of his inocents

 Secondly any Canadian who has worked and participates in the
 insurance it's a negative option you have to explicitly decline
 it knows that the premium is deducted separately 

yes and some Americans actually have a problem with having more
of their money taken from them to pay for others' health care

But note again the Canadian and German health insurance is voluntary

Not true I am required to have insurance by law the method of collection
effectively makes it a tax


 but like basic plus cable you have to tell them that you don't
want it  for example Hutterite colonies in western Canada are not
part of it Mennon and Hutter were fundamentalist Protestants from
Germany whose followers left for the New World  Mennonites are a
very diverse lot while Hutterites are similiar to the Amish  The
American idea being floated today gives you no option but to live
off the land 

the selfish bastards that they are unfortunately that number has
diminished recently but once President Pinocchio gets through
with us i hope for a reversal of trend

Well here we have the right hoping for more selfish bastards Pity they
don't look at what  years of the ReganBush selfish Bastard ecconomy
has done to the country

Elect a selfish bastard government and they will run the country for themselves
thats why they are selfish bastards Bush and Regan gave tax breaks for the
ultra rich and paid for them by borrowing against the incomes of the middle
class

Come to that under the original plan there wasn't meant to be anything
much for the federal government to do except keep the British out

       That's also untrue but at least we're wandering a little closer
toward reality  That the Articles of Confederation fell apart is enough
proof it was there for just a tad bit more

Well yes and no The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them They
certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this
was not necessarily their true position

And like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty
wide powers Unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock
set in

       I wasn't aware the House of Lords had wide powers  I was under the
impression is was pretty powerless compared to the House of Commons and
certainly didn't have almost equal their powers  The Senate is restricted
only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising revenue

The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question
The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 
and David Llloyd George's budget Even despite this the House of Lords has
considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body 


       My reading of the Constitution and other writings gives me absolutely
no reason to believe the Senate wasn't intended to make use of their 
lawmaking powers  In fact gridlock appears to have been designed
into the system with the Senate being a more deliberative body to act
as a check on the moreoften elected House

The system is meant to be slow to react the problem is that it ended up
a bit too slow


       On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be
some sort of rubberstamp for the House  You'll note that while the
President's veto may be overridden the House can't do anything about
a veto by the Senate

The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate Until Bush abused it
in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent
of being a check on unreasonable legislation The veto was clearly regarded 
as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to

The filibuster does not make sense because the senate is elected as a last
gasp assembly It is designed to be the repository of doddery old men with
no power

       Phill I don't know which Senate you're discussing but it ain't
ours

Phill probably thinks that the US senate is supposed to be the equivalent
to the UK's House of Lords

The status of the House of Lords today is quite different to its status 
in  


Which just goes to show that where the US is concerned Phill still has no
idea what he is talking about

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for
several years before they wrote the federalist papers That the US system
is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted
At the time there was no other major country with a representative body
The French plebicite had been suppressed for  years and its restoration
eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution 

After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course
the classical systems Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were 
models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged
disasters The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal
state was constructed a war would be inevitable The Greek democracies were
always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade Had
the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of
Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due
course Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon
as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact not
from the fire

	Thoughts

How can a witness tell that someone in a burning truck is dead rather than
unconscious

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed 
Shouldn't that be up to a jury

What kind of witnesses  If we are talking about witnesses who were at
the accident or were otherwise directly involved eg paramedics
emergency room doctors etc then they should have been used at the
first trial  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and
forgot to call all of your witnesses

If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new
interpretations of the data note that the loser can ALWAYS find
such witnesses  If this were grounds for a new trial then the loser
could ALWAYS get a new trial and keep doing so until the loser
becomes a winner and then the other side would come up with new
expert witnesses

 What I see is that the media is reasonably fair but is seen as
 'liberal' by conservatives and 'conservative' by liberals

Not that I think anyone cares but this pattern using other examples
of course was discussed  years ago by Aristotle in
NicomacheanEthics   Note that you can't use this insight to reason
backwards eg  Since the conservatives see the media as liberal and
the liberals see the media as conservative the media are fair  though
I've seen this reasoning implied

Come to that under the original plan there wasn't meant to be anything
much for the federal government to do except keep the British out

       That's also untrue but at least we're wandering a little closer
toward reality  That the Articles of Confederation fell apart is enough
proof it was there for just a tad bit more

Well yes and no The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them 

       There are a couple of ways to look at them  One is We want
you to support this Constitution so we'll say anything that we think
will appeal to you or the more straightforward This is why we think
what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea

       You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation

They
certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this
was not necessarily their true position

       Well I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist and 
probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules
But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions
on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the
government

       And is writing in support of something automatically propoganda
to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what
they don't believe

And like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty
wide powers Unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock
set in

       I wasn't aware the House of Lords had wide powers  I was under the
impression is was pretty powerless compared to the House of Commons and
certainly didn't have almost equal their powers  The Senate is restricted
only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising revenue

The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in 
question

       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords than
we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also
In fact they both were because the British government had much
greater power than did the American system       

       My reading of the Constitution and other writings gives me absolutely
no reason to believe the Senate wasn't intended to make use of their 
lawmaking powers  In fact gridlock appears to have been designed
into the system with the Senate being a more deliberative body to act
as a check on the moreoften elected House

The system is meant to be slow to react the problem is that it ended up
a bit too slow

       I disagree  The system is not too slow it was simply designed to
handle less than it has demanded that it handle  As somebody in Washington
put it whose name I forget Congress has become everybody's city
council

       Congress is more than capable of quick action and has more than
enough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what its
original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy

       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing
but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically
wanted to avoid  Namely a concentration of power  It would seem
then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either
House in some attempt to grease the wheels  All you'll get then is
a system which moves quicker to do stupid things  It would make more
sense to make more decisions at a local level

       On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be
some sort of rubberstamp for the House  You'll note that while the
President's veto may be overridden the House can't do anything about
a veto by the Senate

The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate Until Bush abused it
in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent
of being a check on unreasonable legislation 

       Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an extraordinary
manner

The veto was clearly regarded 
as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to
preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive

       I fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise were
placed on the veto  It could just as easily have been read as a means
to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive's
opinion policies  

       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power
regarding what a bill is for  Previous Presidents have used the veto
for any number of reasons most usually having something to do with their
agenda  I am really curious how you single Bush out as the President
who abused vetos

the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body it is meant as
a check on unrestrained legislation That is the extra measure built into
the constitution in favour of the status quo  of the representatives
of the states is not a reasonable restriction

       Why is it not a reasonable restriction  Because  Senators
is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based  If  Senators
feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and 
fillibuster isn't that enough to indicate there's a sufficient question
as to whether a law is a good idea or not to reevaluate it

       Why one earth should  be sufficient to enact a law which
covers  million people in very very diverse places and living
in radically different conditions  Why shouldn't a supermajority
be required

       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power
to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignored  I do not
see this as a positive thing  And for all that I'm sure the Republicans
are looking for pork as much as the Democrats they've got some legitimate
objections to the legislation in question

Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy
theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist 
support  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People 
are incapable of thinking for themselves  This elitist attitude will be the
eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America as The People
begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children

Fascism with a Friendly Face Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of 
Anyone
Daevid BornhuetterMachen The Madison Edge

The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that 
Hitler was original and showed initiative 
Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show ABC Radio Network 
October  

Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale
of Mr Limbaugh I find him entertaining and I often agree with his 
conclusions  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these
idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining



NLNSBelieve it or not I was planning this comparative review of 
Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant The Way Things Ought to 
Be before Sahl issued his comparative review As usual Sahl's was 
independent and sharp as a scalpel
        My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's At 
least it has a fairly popular orginating premise everyone I'd mention the 
idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for 
delivery
        Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the 
most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets Both are 
noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills which they both used with 
passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions in 
fact Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over  million almost 
identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April  German 
election Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult and 
enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their 
ideological quilt

Actually I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating
skills sometimes lacking even though his conclusions are often correct

I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated 
political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the right things
where right is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement
is showing an acute case of myopic social perspective not to mention
arrogance and utter stupidity

Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect but his opponents in the established
body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of
virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry and for the elimination
of local control over Affairs Public  

Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated 
like errant children by a selfimportant group of arrogant controlling myopic 
people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the oughtabe's
inside their own hopelessly closed minds



        The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening 
pages of both books Hitler's example is when on page  he claims the 
German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter he bombed part of a railway 
line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg being caught in the act in  
was betrayed to France by a representative of his government when 
there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement
        In fact the governments of both the Reich and Prussia as well as 
the Vatican actively intervened to save him from execution and almost 
succeeded 

OK let us take your word for that and work with it  A nice specific
incident



Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic 
claim in his introduction that in a school or during a commencement 
ceremony or many other public places God is unconstitutional Of 
course it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of 
God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional But Limbaugh is 
too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that

Hmmm Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion
nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof  Liberal translation the
federal government as long as it is run by Liberals may force local
school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays
while prohibiting others

I think Limbaugh has you on this one  It seems to me that he is arguing
for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion

Nice job on the specificity of that one too



Analysis of historicalmodern communication media deleted 

        But as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night some 
cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of 
their propoganda And remember Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these 
days
        Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf 
Hess is the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin the former president of 
ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media the radio 
program's production company But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk 
show having hosted them in New York Washington and Los Angeles He 
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men He knows 
that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the 
opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him Limbaugh 
earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did it's almost worthy of a 
RICO indictment

Ah yes it is a conspiracy of profound proportions  Methinks that you
may be a bit resentful of Mr Limbaugh's success because you attribute it
primarily to luck how after all could anyone with profound differences
of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of
conspiracy or blind luck  Do you feel this same level of kneejerk
resentment against lottery winners or do you congratulate them on their
good fortune



        On questions of social issues there is an overabundance of 
material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom For 
example

This should be great fun since it is the Liberal movement in America
that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People
and business governmentbusiness 'partnership' indeed and Mr Limbaugh 
is the populist nemesis of that movement

I have read Mr Limbaugh's book and although it was not the most literary
piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain venom
at all let alone venom comparable to an individual who callously murdered
millions out of racism



On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society
        Hitler Out of the host of sometimes millions of people who 
individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly 
perhaps understand it one man author's emphasis must step forward in 
order to form with apodeictic force out of the wavering world of 
imagination of the great masses granite principles and to take up the fight 
for their sole correctness until out of the playing waves of a free world of 
thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises 
page 

A very serious tone in that oratory



        Limbaugh Who needs the media when they've got me  The 
show is devoted exclusively to what I think  the phrase with half my 
brain tied behind my back to make it even denotes the egress of mental 
aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree 
with me  It might take four or five years but I'm convinced The Media 
will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking kicking 
and screaming all the way pages    and  respectively

You neglect to mention that Mr Limbaugh have you ever listened to his show 
BTW continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather
than blindly following any media icon himself included  You yourself mention 
that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions
He also adopts a rather satirical approach and presumes his audience to be
intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness and he says as much
This is in contrast to the average massmedia show in which the audience is
treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator

I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire I am sure he was just
kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and
needed to be exterminated



On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
        Hitler In this world human culture and civilization are 
inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan His dyingoff or his 
decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without 
culture  He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord 
sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the 
expulsion from Paradise Page 

This is not religion it is clearly a perverse worship of race  Since
Christ was a Jew it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of
the Aryan as the highest image of the Lord fits with Christian doctrine



        Limbaugh America was founded as a JudeoChristian country  
But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or 
ambivalent toward religion  People for whom belief in God is at best a 
charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools 
for the last thirty years Is it only a coincidence that the quality of 
American education has declined ever since pages 

Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than
publicly funded schools  American history is indeed primarily Judeo
Christian  I suppose that Mr Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent
to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race  I think you might be reaching
just a wee bit here



On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
        Hitler The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in  
One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses vaudevilles and 
theatres and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food  
Theatre art literature movies the press billposters and window displays 
must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the 
service of a moral idea of State and culture pages  and 

Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment
industry here


        Limbaugh Today Hollywood is in trouble The reason is that 
Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is  They make fun of people 
who believe in God They ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality 
and monagamy They disparage American heroes page 

Just a guess here but I don't think that Mr Limbaugh would advocate
government control of Hollywood  You should perhaps call his radio show
to confirm this  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the
depraved moral values it espouses not an advocation of government control 
of Hollywood

's Liberals on the other hand want to have complete government control 
of our school systems so that the government can teach The People at an
early age the right way to view religion and morality  I believe Mr 
Limbaugh is against this as his satirical use of the young heads full
of mush hyperbole indicates



On the News Meida
        Hitler The activity of the socalled liberal press was the work of 
gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich One can pass 
by in silence the Marxist papers of lies  it's task is only to break the 
people's folkish and national spine in order to make it ripe for the yoke of 
slavery of international capital and its masters the Jews Page 

Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here with an implicit plea for
government power to be used to break up the conspiracy



        Limbaugh Elements of The Media have jumped on the 
bandwagon of leftist causes The cynical journalist of the past has been 
replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes  During 
the Gulf war CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw said CNN is a global 
network We can't take sides Cant take sides     If they don't 
realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that 
therefore they should defend this nation they are hopelessly misguided 
and may I suggest flirting with megalomania pages  and 

Indication here that Elements of the Media since career is a selfselected
categorization perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in
the populace at large' has a leftist bias  Doesn't sound too unreasonable
No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion only
that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the
situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal

You may disagree and it may well be exagerrated but it is not an unreasonable 
opinion and Mr Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his 
audience knows that these are his opinions unlike most other reporting that 
purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree 
or other in a statistical sense reflect the biases of the reporters  Who 
is being disingenuous here Mr Shaw or Mr Limbaugh

Again you should ask Mr Limbaugh himself but I expect that he would
oppose government control of the media



          
        
To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible but 
ultimately too depressing to take in one reading

It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance
Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people
who disagree with them  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology
on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons
Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that
they exist in your mind not the real world



        After putting these books down there is one undeniable fact that 
haunts me In the s Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened 
Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them in turn it allowed 
Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis In the s 
Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing distributing hatred to 
depressed and frightened Americans in turn it is helping the American 
radical right to maintain its power base as the year nightmare of the 
ReaganBush era comes to an end hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for 
The Fascist States of America

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve
Rush Limbaugh as a hatemonger but in my experience he has been spreading
laughter at the ludicrous selfimportance of the Left not hatred

As to Mr Bush you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings
Mr Reagan on the other hand did his best to reverse the fascist trend
of government involvement in business  Mr Clinton is increasing fascism
in America through businessgovernment partnership and increased levels
of taxation  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes
in grade school



        And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler it is only because the 
radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate One can only 
wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on

Hmmm  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler
because he has not murdered six million Jews and many many others out of
racism  I come from a mixedrace family so I am quite well attuned to
racism I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh  The only place I hear 
racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal 
Left

The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked
on the opiates of Socialized Medicine Socialized Transportation Socialized
Education etc  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to 
that Liberal drug the Social Security Chain Letter  It is quite clear
to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush 
Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton if one of the two is closer than 
the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton

 Any thoughts on who is going to count all of the gorgeous bodies at 
 the MOW  The press  The White House Staff  The most Junior 
 Senator  The King of the motssbi  

 Just curious as to whose bias we are going to see when the numbers 
 get brought out

Probably law enforcement people Park Service Police and DC cops
who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the
density of the crowd in small regions

These sort of techniques derive from Army Intelligence and CIA
methods of estimating troop strength and tend to be
methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers
so as to justify bigger budgets

On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
his so called stimulus package
It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
immunizations for poor kids

Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to
go have it done  The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents
who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done

I don't know where YOU live but this is not the case nationawide
Perhaps your state or municipality has put together the funds to 
do so but in my area and most areas where I know people immunizations
cost 

Sorry to shatter your stereotypes


 
    In case you haven't noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program  Access here means that folks who do not give 
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps

	No I'm saying any long term investor the ones likely to have large
capital gains would be foolish to sell in order to avoid a tax hike that a
might disappear in any given year and b be overcome in a year or two by
accumlated gains

To which my response isso what  Not all people who pay capital gains
taxes are long term investors  More than enough of them aren't for there
to be huge blip whenever capital gains taxes get raised
   I never said that everyone would find this advantageous  I said that
more than enough would for the result to be readily noticeable and distort
trends

Even if Brett's eventualreturn figures were correct  and they
clearly weren't  he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '
blip because he fails to consider  basic factors

 As Ted notes not everyone is a longterm investor  One might find
oneself as I did in late  anticipating expenses in the near term
that require selling off holdings  Given the choice between waiting a
few weeks and taking an extra tax hit or selling in December with
preferential tax treatment only a fool would choose the former

 The fact that Brett can now construct post hoc calculations of
what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects
beside the point  There was plenty of Moneystyle advice given to
unsophisticated investors in late  to sell now and save on
taxes  In case anyone missed it there was no shortage of similar
advice late last year in the NYTimes eg even though that advice
was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law as in 
but merely on the assumption that Clinton would raise tax rates
without capping CG taxes contrary to the current proposal

It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal
economic interest  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless
pulleys though this sort of thinking often fails to describe
accurately what happens in the real world

RE Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly


Unless Dennis's parents were excentric in their naming a girl with
a boy's name I strongly suspect that abortion might be a medical service
that his insurers were not counting on him requiring


When an insurance company attempted to set up lower rates for non smokers
in the early s they got spiked by the tobacco industry Anyone know what
the current status is on the smoking issue


If Denis really wants to have a fair insurance premium I take it he would 
be willing to have DNA fingerprinting done so that the company could weed out
all but the cast iron non risk cases

US health financing system sucks certainly its killing a hell of a lot of
people every year

While both organizations may on paper support the abolition of the age
of consent there the resemblance stops

One supports the removal of a coercive law the other a paper facade
to legitimize sexual relations with children

What's the difference in practice

It amounts to your saying it's disgusting but should be legal

or

someone else saying let's allow the parties involved to decide what is
disgusting

Or if you're like me you think that it ISN'T a coercive law because
some children can't make informed consent

 As noted in another thread Limiting govt the problem libertarians face
 is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the 
 tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda
 



It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE
opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own
agendas and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen
While I can't offer such a proof it seems pretty damn plausible that
if the government does not regulate a particular area it cannot become
a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area
I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is
more likely to become such a tool and that it IS such a tool in many
instances

Just
as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition

I suspect that this is because improvement in the human condition as
you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism and would not
be the primary goal of a libertarian government  My impression of
libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of
government coercion except in a very limited cases

 Secondly any Canadian who has worked and participates in the
 insurance it's a negative option you have to explicitly decline
 it knows that the premium is deducted separately 

yes and some Americans actually have a problem with having more
of their money taken from them to pay for others' health care

But note again the Canadian and German health insurance is
voluntary

Not true I am required to have insurance by law the method of
collection effectively makes it a tax

Could it be because you're British Phill and living in Germany
While the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in
the  USCanada FTA there's probably a law about that having
health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here
for example

You have mentioned this once before yet both the NY Times profile on
the German sickness funds late Jan and pamphlets that my girlfriend
gives to her language students from the German consulate both say that
it is voluntary okay there were quotation marks  and that only
 of the population is covered by the sickness funds analogous to
our provincial health insurances but not divided by provincestate

Another guy in health care policy says that the Turkish guest workers
aren't covered  he's written to me a couple of times he's not a
poster  I'll ask him

  What a bunch of crock I have never heard of any incident in which the
  thrower of the ceremonial ball has been booed before
  
  Dan Quayle got roundly booed in Milwaulkee last year  I was listening 
  on the radio  This was the game that Quayle told the Brewers players that
  he would like to see them play the Orioles in the ALCS
 
 It's come to this has it  Defending Al Gore by comparing him to Dan Quayle

Who compared Quayle to Gore  Mark said he had never heard of any incident
in which the thrower of the ceremonial ball had been booed before  I mentioned
another incident  And if the media had a liberal bias I'm sure he would
have heard of the Quayle incident

If I was to compare Quayle to anyone it most likely would be Elmer Fudd

 I'd say that about says it all back to the pit with ye back to altfan

 In the world of the future Bill Clinton will appoint Canadians to
 govern all American institutions starting with the American health
 care system  We will be benevolent Canadian dictators

With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to
pay for new free'' social programs I've really begun to suspect
that the Canadians long resentful of their place in the American
shadow brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some
time between  and  tutored him in the ways of Canadian
socialism awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got
the correct answers then returned him to the states under the
control of the domineering wife assigned to his case to attain high
public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market
forces in America thus shaping America in the Canadian image

It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams
 
You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE
opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own
agendas and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen
While I can't offer such a proof it seems pretty damn plausible that
if the government does not regulate a particular area it cannot become
a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area
I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is
more likely to become such a tool and that it IS such a tool in many
instances
 
Pardon me for interrupting but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other
possibilities besides more government less government or no government
and stop there It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH
deeper than government Democracies seem to reflective of the majority
of society both the good and the bad If you take away the government
you still have the structural flaws in society except this time with
no restraints Yes No
	Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society like a
kibbutz I never studied it on depth but from what I've heard the kibbutz
in Isreal was very successful It is also very close to what Aristotle
and Socrates believed was the best
	Sorry to detract from the discussion

Just
as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition
 
I suspect that this is because improvement in the human condition as
you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism and would not
be the primary goal of a libertarian government  My impression of
libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of
government coercion except in a very limited cases

But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human
condition Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't 
improve their lives I know that there are and will be libertarians 
who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives I can deal
with that All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must
be the PRIMARY goal of any organization

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                                  April  


                            PRESS BRIEFING
                           BY DEE DEE MYERS

	     
                          The Briefing Room


 AM EDT

	     	  
	     Q	  Why was the  am postponed 
	     	  
	     MS MYERS  Just due to scheduling conflicts  So as we 
put out the President will meet with the leaders of the national 
police organizations at  pm in the Rose Garden as opposed to 
 am  The only other things on his schedule today are  At 
 am he'll meet with General Vessey who as you know is on 
his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIAPOW issue  At 
 pm he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval 
Office  And at  pm he'll meet with the police organizations
Then from  pm to  pm he'll do his weekly photos with the 
various groups
	     
	     Q	  A photo op with Vessey
	     
	     MS MYERS  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting
	     
	     Q	  Why
	     
	     MS MYERS  Why  It's a closed meeting  
	     
	     Q	  What about the lunch
	     
	     MS MYERS  The lunch  No there's no coverage
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with any congress people today
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing scheduled
	     
	     Q	  There are no meetings 
	     
	     MS MYERS  There are no congressional meetings today 
no
	     
	     Q	  Has the President been given any information by the 
Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report 
from Hanoi  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the 
Vietnamese on that subject
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well clearly the report is the first order 
of business  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll 
discuss  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the 
parameters of his visit to Vietnam today but the President hasn't 
drawn any conclusions about the report yet  Certainly it's 
something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese 
about first
	     
	     Q	  Did the President talk with any Republican senators 
yesterday about the stimulus package
	     
	     MS MYERS  He spoke with Senator Dole
	     
	     Q	  How many times
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe once during the day and once last 
night
	     
	     Q	  What was the outcome of that
	     
	     MS MYERS  They're continuing to work toward some kind 
of an agreement on a jobs package
	     
	     Q	  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any 
way flexible on this
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well I think we're hopeful that we're going 
to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate and we'll 
continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some 
kind of an agreement
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss the VAT tax
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't know if that came up
	     
	     Q	  Can you check that
	     
	     MS MYERS  Sure

	     Q	  So what are they  is the President offering to 
scale down his program  is that what he's trying to do buy it down 
to where Dole will sign on
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well he's trying to protect as much of it 
as he can  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs 
package through the Senate and through Congress now  And as soon as 
we reach some conclusions on that we'll let you know  But at the 
moment he's continuing to consult with members of Congress 
including obviously Senator Dole
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody else
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe he talked to any other 
Republicans yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody today
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't think anything is scheduled but I 
wouldn't rule it out
	     
	     Q	  We were led to believe that the President called 
Mr Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the 
conversation around to stimulus package  Is that correct
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think the President has contacted several 
people on Russian aid  I think that it was always expected that the 
stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation 
he would have with Senator Dole  The primary objective of the 
conversation was Russian aid  That was the first order of business 
but it was both
	     
	     Q	  In the President's mind are they linked 
politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the 
stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to 
the American people  Has he made that argument
	     
	     MS MYERS  I can't talk about specifically what 
arguments he might have made  The President is obviously committed 
to both  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people 
first  But as you know we outlined the details of additional 
Russian aid last night in Tokyo
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that the stimulus 
package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for 
Russian  to accept a vote for Russian aid
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that the President is going to 
continue to work to pass the stimulus package to pass a jobs 
package and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs 
package through the Congress
	     
	     Q	  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating 
now with Dole
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's discussing options with him
	     
	     Q	  On the stimulus is it your understanding that over 
the break some Democrats themselves have left the support that they 
had earlier for the package the stimulus package
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think we still have wide support in the 
Senate for the jobs package
	     
	     Q	  But specifically that you've lost Democrats other 
than Shelby
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe so  There hasn't been a 
vote
	     
	     Q	  What about Kohl
	     
	     Q	  Kohl and Feingold
	     
	     MS MYERS  There hasn't been a vote yet  And we'll 
continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to 
bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of 
the members of the United States Senate support the package
	     
	     Q	  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold 
why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think George pointed out a number of 
projects in a number of states that stand to be funded or to lose 
funding if this jobs package doesn't pass
	     
	     Q	  No Democrats  Laughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'll let you draw your own conclusions
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any 
other Republicans again today
	     
	     MS MYERS  There's nothing specifically scheduled but 
again I wouldn't rule it out
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to 
any other states today
	     
	     MS MYERS  What we've done is we're in the process of 
breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state  I 
think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those 
up we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest 
how their states would benefit from this package
	     
	     Q	  Will you share those with us
	     
	     MS MYERS  Sure  As we did yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Do you have copies of the ones you sent 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes we made those available yesterday  And 
we certainly can continue to provide them today
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee since yesterday's questions and subsequent 
stories about the VAT what further consideration of this issue has 
been given
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing's changed since yesterday  I think 
the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was 
something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he 
has not made a decision on and I don't think we have anything to add 
to that
	     
	     Q	  But he also said that business and labor groups are 
telling him they support it  Can you tell us 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that there has been  I'm not going 
to speculate on who supports it  I think the President said that 
there has been some support among business and labor groups  I don't 
think he said he was directly contacted by them
	     
	     Q	  Are we to take that to mean that the administration 
has sounded out business and labor groups on this 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think there's been plenty of public 
discourse on this over the years and even recently but I don't think 
I want to add to that
	     
	     Q	  In February though the President said that this 
was something to be considered  or  years down the road  What 
has happened between then and now to cause this administration to 
change its mind
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think as we said yesterday it is 
something that the working groups are looking at  They're 
considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to 
specific options that will be covered by the President's health care 
plan  The President has not taken it up yet has not made a decision 
on it  And beyond that I don't have anything to add
	     
	     Q	  You haven't answered the question  It wasn't being 
considered by anyone in the White House after the President's 
comments in February and George reaffirmed that in a briefing
	     
	     Q	  And then suddenly 
	     
	     Q	  What happened

	     MS MYERS  The working groups as we have said 
throughout we instructed to consider a wide variety of options 
acrosstheboard  And one of the things that has been talked about 
and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a valueadded 
tax

	     Q	  But the President himself took this off the table 
Dee Dee and suddenly it reappears  And this goes to the credibility 
of this administration in a way  What has happened in the meantime

	     MS MYERS  The President has not looked at this it 
hasn't been presented to him again yet  The working groups are 
looking at it as they're looking at a wide variety of options and 
no decisions have been made

	     Q	  And it raises the question of how independently the 
task force is working

	     MS MYERS  The task force was instructed to consider 
all options and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're 
considering all options

	     Q	  But that's not the impression that the President 
left in February  The impression he left was that this was something 
that was longrange to be looked at   years down the road  The 
clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was 
not on the table not an option 

	     Q	  If it changes I'll tell you
	     
	     Q	  Bring him on

	     Q	  And you repeatedly referred to the President's 
remarks telling us that those were still in operation
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's changed and we told you  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna 
Shalala comments were about  I mean that seemed like an 
orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers 


	     MS MYERS  I wouldn't  no Alice Rivlin's not a 
Cabinet member first of all  Second of all it was not 
orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday and in the last 
couple of days that it's something that's being looked at  We 
confirmed that yesterday  And I don't have anything to add to that

	     Q	  Is it because he has very few options

	     Q	  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon 
the task force to convince the President about  In other words has 
the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the 
task force to convince him to put it back on the table  Or is it in 
fact back on the table having been placed there by discussions with 
the President  

	     MS MYERS  It is not the working group's mission at 
this point to convince the President of anything  It is their 
mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and 
the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options  I 
think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that 
context and at this point he's not  that presentation has not been 
made but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a 
decision on

	     Q	  They will present it to him as one of his options 
though he specifically ruled it out

	     MS MYERS  Correct

	     Q	  Dee Dee is this more than a trial balloon  Is 
this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to 
this form of taxation

	     MS MYERS  It's simply a statement of fact  The 
working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number 
of issues relating to health care reform  One of the options that 
they're looking at is the VAT 

	     Q	  Dee Dee when the working groups were examining 
this possibility was this on the table during the same time period 
that you were telling us that it was not

	     MS MYERS  I don't know what the specific timing of 
their drafting of options is  I don't know

	     Q	  Who was telling you that it was not under 
consideration

	     MS MYERS  I was referring back to the President's 
comments

	     Q	  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise 
enough money to fund the core benefit package

	     MS MYERS  No there's no decisions that have been made 
on how to pay for the health care plan
	     
	     Q	  I'm asking whether the projections 
	     
	     MS MYERS  There's a number of options depending on how 
the plan is structured  You can't decide how much the plan is going 
to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like  And so 
you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out 
until you know

	     Q	  Dee Dee we've been told that they have a computer 
models on a number of possible packages

	     MS MYERS  Correct  

	     Q	  The question is whether they have now determined 
whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest 
minimum package  That is not a very difficult computation

	     MS MYERS  It is a question that you know that we're 
not going to answer until  there's a number of options being 
considered  It depends on how the package is structured  The exact 
details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for 
them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made  
	     
	     Q	  And when the President has been meeting with health 
care  his health care advisors which we are told he has been doing 

	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct
	     
	     Q	     they have never once said to him these are your 
funding options including the VAT  He has never heard the word VAT 
in his 
	     
	     MS MYERS    I am not going to comment on the specific 
nature of the daily  they're not daily but the quasiregular 
briefings
	     
	     Q	  Well you have
	     
	     MS MYERS  I have not other than to say that he's not 
considered the VAT  And I think that is a true statement
	     
	     Q	  No but you said that it has not been presented to 
him as an option
	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct
	     
	     Q	  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'm not going to get into the details of 
what's discussed  I think that statement stands for itself
	     
	     Q	     specific Dee Dee  When you say he hasn't 
looked at it do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of 
paying for medical coverage or hasn't looked at it in general  
Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it 
works what the advantages are the whole thing  It sounds like 
	     
	     MS MYERS  But that was  I think in Chilicothe if 
you go back to his remarks there it was a broader philosophical 
discussion of the tax structure  And I think the comments were 
generally in reference to the overall economic plan  But clearly 
it's something that he's thought about in the broad context  I mean 
that was clear in Chilicothe  What I'm saying is that in the process 
of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet  
It's something that the working groups will present to him among the 
number of options and that no decisions have been made  And I'm not 
going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where 
health care issues are being discussed
	     
	     Q	  It's your statement from this podium that no 
discussion of this has taken place  You say that no option  that 
the option has not been presented to him
	     
	     MS MYERS  That is correct
	     
	     Q	  Do you stand by  does the White House still stand 
by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal
	     
	     MS MYERS  No decisions have been made  We have 
nothing to add to what's already been said
	     
	     Q	  Let me follow up here  Do you stand by what Rivlin 
said yesterday that if any kind of VAT were to be used or 
considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made 
so that it would be less regressive
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'm not going to comment any further on what 
might happen if
	     
	     Q	  But do you stand by the previous conversations in 
February that if there were to be a VAT I think the President said 
you'd exclude food and energy 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'm not going to comment on the specific 
structure of a decision that hasn't been made
	     
	     Q	  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's 
comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working 
groups
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't know specifically what 
	     
	     Q	  Could you check for us because that's a real 
important credibility question
	     
	     MS MYERS  Sure
	     
	     Q	  Since the task force was brought together this 
issue has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one 
fairly painless way to raise a lot of money  Were you all kept in 
the dark  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month 
and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be 
considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think we've said all that we have to say  
It is something the working groups are looking at  The President has 
not made a decision about it yet  And beyond that I have nothing to 
add
	     
	     Q	  Well sorry Dee Dee there are still a couple of 
questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem 
with credibility here  yours primarily  What we're asking is if 
you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered 
while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not or if 
it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading 
us
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe that anyone has ever come 
out here and deliberately misled you from this podium  ever ever
	     
	     Q	  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to 
indicate something  has anybody told anybody to come out 
	     
	     MS MYERS  We're not trying to shade answers or 
deliberately mislead anybody  I've said what I have to say about 
this issue
	     
	     Q	  All we were trying to find out 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I understand what you're trying to find out 
and I've given you the answers Helen
	     
	     Q	  We're trying to find out what changed  what made 
it an option again  That's the 
	     
	     MS MYERS  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to investigate all options and they are doing that  
	     
	     Q	  Yes but it wasn't an option before  How can you 
investigate it if the President has taken it off the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  It is something that they're obviously 
considering and the President has not made a decision on
	     
	     Q	  Yes but he took it off the table in February
	     
	     MS MYERS  Working groups are considering it  They'll 
present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision
	     
	     Q	  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off 
the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's clearly on the table 
	     
	     Q	  Yes but he took it off the table  Did he change 
his mind
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's back on the table Bill
	     
	     Q	  Did he change his mind
	     
	     MS MYERS  He said this morning that he hasn't made a 
decision about it  He obviously knows that it's on the table  It's 
something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on 
this we'll let you know
	     
	     Q	  So he must have changed his mind right
	     
	     MS MYERS  At some point it will be looked at  I mean 

	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee there's like two options  either he 
changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority 
exceeds the President's
	     
	     MS MYERS  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to look at all options they've done that
	     
	     Q	  Are you going to put out his income tax
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes there will be something available on 
his income tax probably later this afternoon  His return will be 
available 
	     
	     Q	  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through 
it
	     
	     MS MYERS  No nothing's planned  I think someone will 
be available probably not in a briefing setting but to walk you 
through the questions
	     
	     Q	  We're used to be walked linebyline through the 
presidential tax forms
	     
	     MS MYERS  I've seen those briefings  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Could we have one
	     
	     MS MYERS   No I don't think there will be any kind of 
a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer 
your questions about it
	     
	     Q	  Did they file a joint form
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  When did he file it
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe it's being filed today
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee is there going to be a backgrounder for 
Miyazawa
	     
	     MS MYERS  No there will be a readout after the 
meeting
	     
	     Q	  No backgrounder today
	     
	     MS MYERS  No backgrounder today
	     
	     Q	  This is complicated stuff  We need help  
Laughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in 
one day it's too confusing  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of 
force in Bosnia   They've both said that A they never ruled it 
out and B it might be necessary now  Does that influence your 
thinking on whether or not to change your approach
	     
	     MS MYERS  There's been no change in our policy towards 
Bosnia  We have always said that we'd consider 
	     
	     Q	  But does that impact upon your decision  Are they 
people whose opinions would carry weight with you
	     
	     MS MYERS  They're people whose opinions carry weight 
certainly  I mean the President supports the process that they've 
initiated  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia 
although we're considering a number of options right now  If the 
Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table if they don't sign on 
to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options 
which we've been saying regularly
	     
	     Q	  One followup question then  We cannot get a 
straight answer from anyone in the administration  Why do you not 
set a deadline for the Serbs  Can you tell us the strategic or 
tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  We're continuing to put pressure on them 
every day
	     
	     Q	  Which doesn't work so 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well we think it is having some effect  
We're going to continue to tighten sanctions  As you know we 
support the omnibus resolution  We expect that to come to a vote on 
the th  
	     
	     Q	  You say it's having an effect  can you give us 
any documentation
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to 
you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that
	     
	     Q	  There's been no  you have not been able to 
provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any 
effect in Bosnia  Serbia yes in Bosnia no
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that they've had effect in Serbia 
and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia  And again I'll be 
happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if 
you'd like
	     
	     Q	  We would like to hear from someone who can show us 
what the effect has been in Bosnia  We had the briefing on all of 
the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade but we haven't 
seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting  Can you 
provide something along those lines
	     
	     MS MYERS  I will see what I can get you
	     
	     Q	  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced 
this morning  where is that money coming from
	     
	     MS MYERS  We'll have to work with Congress on the 
details of that package
	     
	     Q	  So that would be new money that you would hope to 
get
	     
	     MS MYERS    Yes that's new money in addition to the 
 billion announced in Vancouver  So I assume that you all have 
seen the billion package that was announced this morning in 
Tokyo by Secretary Christopher
	     
	     Q	  Isn't there a concern though about offering 
something which you have to get in Congress  I mean that was the 
concern with Vancouver you didn't want to do that
	     
	     MS MYERS  The concern with Vancouver was to do 
something immediately which required money that was already approved 
in the Fiscal ' budget  What we're looking at now is a little bit 
longerterm plan to build on top of the  billion that we 
announced in Vancouver  This clearly will require congressional 
approval or some of it will anyway and we're going to continue to 
work with Congress to make that happen
	     
	     Q	  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by 
Congress
	     
	     MS MYERS  The President has had a number of 
conversations with members and will continue to work with them as 
this process moves forward
	     
	     Q	  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a 
fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through 
Congress
	     
	     MS MYERS  It was created in consultation with 
Congress
	     
	     Q	  In meeting with the law enforcement officials is 
that  does that have a set speech and a goal  A direction
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes the President will talk about  and 
the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs 
package  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help 
give kids something to do
	     
	     Q	  Who are they
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's members or leadership from three 
organizations  NAPO which is the National Association of Police 
Organizations IBPO which is the International Brotherhood of Police 
Organizations I believe and IUPA which is the International Union 
of Police Associations
	     
	     Q	  Will the FBI chief be there
	     
	     MS MYERS  The FBI chief  No
	     
	     Q	  Or any other federal law enforcement officials
	     
	     MS MYERS  No it will be the President and these 
national law enforcement organization leaders
	     
	     Q	  Does the  billion announced today include the 
 million that's in the FY ' budget for disarmament
	     
	     MS MYERS  No  The NunnLugar money is separate
	     
	     Q	  So this would be the  million that's in the 
budget already plus another  billion
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe all of this is on top of the  
million already in the budget
	     
	     Q	  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or 
Fiscal ' 
	     
	     MS MYERS  We'll work with Congress on the exact 
funding mechanism  on exactly how this will be paid for
	     
	     Q	  This  billion on top of 
	     
	     MS MYERS  On top of  million  on top of the  
million NunnLugar money we announced earlier
	     
	     Q	  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob 
Dole  it was on this tranche not on the previous money he was 
calling Bob Dole
	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct
	     
	     Q	  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa
	     
	     MS MYERS  There will be a readout after the meeting 
with Miyazawa  Tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee on a totally unrelated matter some 
Republicans who are active in the US Chamber of Commerce are 
complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House 
and the Chamber of Commerce  There are  the town hall meeting the 
other night the satellite and all of this relationship
Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these 
Chambers of Commerce
	     
	     MS MYERS  That's an interesting charge  Laughter  
After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any 
attention to the Chambers now there are those who would accuse us of 
being too close  I think that's interesting  But no we're thrilled 
by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local 
Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on 
this and other initiatives
	     
	     Q	  What's the status of the President thinking about 
going to this Democratic retreat
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's on his calendar  I think he'll almost 
certainly go
	     
	     Q	  All three days
	     
	     MS MYERS  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be 
there yet  
	     
	     Q	  Is it open to coverage
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I believe the whole thing is closed
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to have any kind of address statement 
anything at all on the gay rights march on the th
	     
	     MS MYERS  We're still looking at that  We haven't 
made a final decision about how we'll  who will make a statement or 
what 
	     
	     Q	  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing is scheduled but I wouldn't rule it 
out
	     
	     Q	  What about an AIDS czar
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's coming
	     
	     Q	  Anything on the weekend
	     
	     Q	  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this 
retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights  or appear 
or have any involvement in the gay rights march
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I think this is something he's been 
discussing for a long time  appearing at the Senate Democratic 
retreat
	     
	     Q	  The weekend
	     
	     MS MYERS  Weekend  Don't know  the only thing on 
right now is the radio address on Saturday
	     
	     Q	  Any travel plans
	     
	     MS MYERS  If it changes  none right now
	     
	     Q	  He's not going to be off campaigning for his 
stimulus package
	     
	     MS MYERS  No specific plans right now
	     
	     Q	  What about midweek  Anything likely
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's possible  Yes I think it's likely 
that we'll travel next week  certainly the weekend
	     
	     Q	  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't know  I'll check
	     
	     Q	  Going to name a drug czar this weekend
	     
	     MS MYERS  This weekend  I don't believe so
	     
	     Q	  And the radio address on Saturday  is that going 
to be focused on the stimulus package
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'm sure it will
	     
	     THE PRESS  Thank you

If after Billions of dollars we can't keep Crack Cocaine out of the hands
of dealers and other criminals how do you propose to keep guns out of
their hands

Brian Douglass			briandanasazicom

It's the billions of dollars we keep flooding into the so called War on drugs
that keeps the cocaine in the hands of the dealers  If it weren't profitable
they wouldn't be in that business  Our tax dollars keep those guys in business
by capturing  of the illegal drugs thus driving the price up   Take 
away the profitability of their business and as a matter of economics they 
won't be in it anymore

If you are arguing for the legalized control of drugs come out and say it
You might be surprised at who supports this pragmatic approach to drug
prohibition

My point was that since government interdiction has had apprecable affect on 
						        
Oops  I mean NO apprecable affect
reducing drug availability how can any thoughtful person believe that 
prohibiting guns will keep them out of the hands of criminals

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                             April       

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                   TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS
	     
	     
                           The Rose Garden 


 PM EDT


	     THE PRESIDENT  Good afternoon  Ladies and gentlemen 
two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our 
national deficit and to increase our investment in the American 
people their jobs and their economic future  The federal budget 
plan passed Congress in record time and created a new sense of hope 
and opportunity in the country  
	     
	     Then the shortterm jobs plan I presented to Congress 
which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed 
the House of Representatives two weeks ago  It now has the support 
of a majority of the United States Senate 
	     
	     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get 
the economy moving again to get job growth going again to get a 
fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity  
Unfortunately a minority of the members of the United States Senate 
have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working 
the will of the majority on the jobs bill
	     
	     When Congress returns I ask every senator from every 
state and from both parties to remember what is at stake  The issue 
is not politics it's people  Sixteen million of them are looking 
for fulltime jobs and can't find them  These men and women don't 
care about who's up or down in Washington  They care about paying 
the rent and meeting the mortgage payment about putting food on the 
table and buying shoes for their children about regaining a sense of 
dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their 
families and drawing a paycheck
	     
	     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of 
serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our 
economy forward  I am prepared to do that  And I have been working 
with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some 
of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs 
plan  I'm willing to compromise so long as we keep the focus on 
jobs keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet 
national needs  
	     
	     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package  
Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what 
size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of 
the American people 
	     
	     But even as we make those reductions and the package 
will be smaller I believe we must address problems that are on the 
minds of millions of Americans and one in particular and that is 
the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the 
dramatic rise in violent crime 
	     
	     So I will ask even in this reduced package for an 
additional  million in federal funding to help local communities 
to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the 
fiscal problems caused by the national recession  Together with a 
matching effort by local governments this could put as many as 
 police officers back on the job and back on the beat in 
communities all across our nation
	     
	     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of 
violent crime when too many businesses have closed and too many 
people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their 
homes rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments 
America can make  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that 
investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind  
	     
	     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep 
the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs  Make no 
mistake about it  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I 
ever have  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight 
for their jobs their future and for fundamental change
	     
	     I want to thank the police officers who are here today 
and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here 
that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to 
rehire police officers  They came here because they believe in the 
summer jobs portion of the package  And I want them to be free to 
talk about that  They came here not out of any law enforcement 
concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country 
to have a chance to have jobs this summer to have safer streets and 
a brighter and more peaceful future
	     
	     I say what I say today not just because it's good for 
law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in 
these communities  I have always supported community policing not 
only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate 
but because it cements better relationships between people in law 
enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect  It reduces 
the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the 
chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time
	     
	     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do  
I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put 
another  police officers on the street over the next four 
years  This makes a good downpayment on that  This keeps in mind 
the core of the jobs package  And this will help us to move forward  
	     
	     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the 
jobs bill let's work together  I can accept a reduced package if 
you will increase your commitment to safe streets  I do not accept 
the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to 
building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will 
create real and lasting  prosperity for our people  I have done my 
part now to end the gridlock I ask you to do yours  
	     
	     I want now to give the people who are here with me on 
the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the 
American people  beginning with Janet Reno the distinguished 
Attorney General
  
	     
	                                       
	     
	     Q	  Mr President can you tell us  do you think that 
the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over 
the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional 
dialogue
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Not at all  I think it should have 
they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other  First of all 
I made absolutely no decision on that  You should know that there's 
a lot of support in the business community and the labor community  
people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden 
of the present system on many of our major employers particularly 
many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the 
strength of this economy  But I have made absolutely no decision 
that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general 
tax
	     
	     Q	  Do you personally believe that the American public 
is ready to pay for  to have another tax to pay for health care  I 
mean apart from what business and labor leaders have said 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I'm not going to speculate on that  I 
will say this  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the 
benefits of all the savings to cover the cost  I mean that is 
everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do if you 
streamline the insurance system if you fix the system so that 
there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to overutilize or 
overprovide certain services if you provide primary and preventive 
care in places where it isn't now every single analysis shows 
absolutely massive savings to the health care system
	     
	     The real question is whether you can transfer those 
savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have 
virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security  I 
have no idea  The polls say that but I don't know  All I know is 
the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned 
they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an 
affordable health care system
	     
	     But I don't think that has anything to do with this 
stimulus and it certainly shouldn't have  People want a job first 
and foremost  They want that more than anything else
	     
	     Q	  Now that you've announced your willingness to 
compromise on the stimulus package can you tell us what parts of 
your package you consider vital and uncompromisable  I assume summer 
jobs is one
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I want the summer jobs I want the 
highway program and I want the police program  I still intend  let 
me say this  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime 
bill which did not pass the Congress last year  This is a 
supplement to that not a substitute for it in any way  But I think 
we need to do that
	     
	     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the 
enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately 
and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people 
with AIDS  And there are several other things that I think should be 
done  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors the 
safety of the public depends on that  
	     
	     There are a number of other things that I don't  I 
don't think any of it should be cut but I have given Senator 
Mitchell and Senator Byrd  I talked to them  And Senator Dole 
called me yesterday to discuss this and I told him that I would call 
him back  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we 
discussed this  And I basically asked them to talk today and said 
that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at 
least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could 
reach some accord  
	     
	     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been 
already and let's see if they can talk it out
	     
	     Q	  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator 
Mitchell did you tell them about your  increase also that  
million that you want that as part of the package
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I did  I told Senator  I left word 
for Senator Mitchell last night about it  When I talked to Senator 
Dole  I don't remember for sure  I do not believe I mentioned it  
But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I 
wanted to break the gridlock and I told him that I was working on a 
reformulation of it so that  in the hope that it would become even 
more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the 
American people wanted us to address  And this is certainly 
consistent with that
	     
	     Thank you

                                 END PM EDT

ARDon't understand the concept of insurance do you Anthony

On the contrary my friend

ARWhat is insurance for

ARTo spread the cost of illnessaccidentetc that does occur in a small
ARpercentage of cases over many  Those who do not face the accidentetc
ARhave peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did those
ARwho do face the accidentetc are not devestated financially anyhow
ARin dealing with it

Insurance is usally taken out buy the people who engage in the action
for which insurance might be used Would you ask a person who does not
drive to pay automobile insurance Or a person who doesn't believe that
medicine is worth the time to by health insurance

It is a pool of people who share a similer fear

ARThis 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances i
ARstupid  Bad things happen to good people too you know

Adrienne when you act to endander yourself or
others knowing that someone else may be burdened for your action is
irresponsible

The democracy works by selecting the people you want to govern and 
to make sure that your opinion is heard Remember what Spock said
the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many

As long as government spending does not contradict the Constitution
I don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected 
a group of people to make decisions in one direction And if this is 
bad then we should elect a new government Democratic systems work
this way and I don't have anything against you raising an opinion

I just hope you realize that each individual should make their

don't trust your fellow Americans to utter their own opinion
just your own

I totally agree  Really the only people this is going to benefit are
those who live in the cities where the train stops  Who wants to drive
to the train station from X Lubbock for example  It's probably farther
to drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport

Growth limits  How will HSR help with the traffic congestion  From what
I understand the rail will not stop in places like Waco or Bryan or
lots of intermediate places in between  Even though I live in Austin
I don't see myself using the train except on rare occasions  probably
twice a year  And at  dollars a ticket I could probably drive for

 Top Ten Signs That It's the Age of Aquarius on Pennsylvania Avenue



 Men in uniform are persona non grata in the home of our Commander in
    Chief

  Algore's enviromentalism will make the Clean Air Act look like an
    industrial policy

  Higher taxes are once again the prescription for all that ails America

  Tax dodging is unpatriotic draft dodging is a symbol of pride

  Beaded curtains hang from the Oval Office windows

  Socialism may be dead in the exSoviet Union but we are told to prepare
    for the nationalization of our health care resources These people
    must be inhaling something

  Not quite free love but eating Flowers is considered healthy

  The feminazis have a President in the White House whether the rest of
    us realize it or not

  Slick may be the first draft dodger to send American troops into
    combat

  Slick may be unpopular with middleclass Americans but he's a BIG HIT
    on campus with the professorial class



Copyright c Edward A Ipser Jr 


Here's my own top ten response to Mr Ipser's list


  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the
     military  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not
     revolve around them and that one of the things they're out there defending
     is our right to be critical of them even denounce them

   Let me explain something to you  Environmental policy and industrial
     policy MUST go hand in hand  Our nation and indeed our planet cannot
     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years
     Our industrialenvironmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL We
     must have active government support of the key industries such as
     telecommunications microelectronics medical biotech and environmental
     tech  Meanwhile weed out old inneficient highpolution industries
     that are better left to other nations  This will make us richer help
     produce new jobs and help the environment  To give credit where credit
     is due I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry DMA
     tonite  In addition it's time we get really really serious about 
     issues like overpopulation globabl warming and ozone depletion  The
     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority

   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work
     to provide the services that people need and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved  Granted some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money and should be  But some things are going to
     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time  You want to live in my country you pay your fair
     share

   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes  If you're
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes

   Hey I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 'sesque touch

   Look Canada Europe and Japan manage to provide health care for their
     citizens and yes basic health IS a human right which people are
     entitled to  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you then
     I guess we've found something better than capitalism  There is nothing
     sacred about the capitalist system and if something be it socialism
     or anything else works better then I say let capitalism die

   Make love not War

   Contrary to popular belief it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse  Women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills  I look forward to it

   See number

On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
his so called stimulus package
It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
immunizations for poor kids

Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to
go have it done  The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents
who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done

    In case you haven't noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program  Access here means that folks who do not give
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps



Excuse me for sticking my nose in but any parentparents who do not allready 
immunize their children especially if it is already free don't deserve one 
frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves or public health 
care service

I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are 
slightly seperate issues but anybody who wouldn't help their kids don't 
deserve my tax help

 There was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute the
 defense merely alledged that she was Even Clayton knows the
 difference Err perhaps Clayton doesn't know the difference 

Evidence given for her prostitute status besides the admittedly 
questionable claim of the man on trial included

 Prior employment in a number of massage parlors with women who
claimed that she worked as a prostitute

 Walking around a truck stop at  AM wearing a lace miniskirt
a halter top and no underwear of any sort

 Not having a purse or other ID with her

Not enough to convict her but enough to create reasonable doubt
whether a rape actually took place or theft of services

Are you just ignorant or lying again

 the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the 
 Marines were engaged in selfdefense
 
 No the judge found that the prosecution did not carry out the burder
 on proof A small clipping from clarinews under fair use guidelines 
 
 	New Hanover District Court Judge Jacqueline MorrisGoodson ruled in
 the benchtrial that the state failed to carry its burden in proving the
 Marines acted to cause injury

The accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self
defense and the judge agreed that they were so operating

   And now those other options don't exist  We probably agree on this
   more than you thinkwelfare was invented to solve a problem of the
   's but the poverty is now so much worse and our economic infra
   structure has been so eroded that it just can't keep up any more
 
  You mean since your philosophy took over the economy has almost
  collapsed
 
 Excuse me my philosophy  You don't have any idea what my philosophy
 is  The American economy has had its ups and downs through a number of
 prevailing economic philosophies  But then economics is hardly a science

In my lifetime your philosophy  socialism masquerading as a liberal
welfare state  has been in ascendancy

 No I mean exactly what I wrotethe welfare system of the New Deal is
 wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs

Absolutely  So the response of socialists is take us even further
into socialism

      Whether or not the fathers work
     is not germane to single mothers
  
    Very true  But the promotion of casual sexuality is something that
    plays a part in the single mother problem
 
   I'll buy thatand there's lots of reasons for it extremely far down on
   the list being the flashinthepan media attention a bunch of middle
   class dropouts got for their philosophy and experimentation  
 
  Flashinthepan  No your subculture has utterly dominated the
  TV and movie industries for two decades now
 
 My subculture  My we're getting personal  The only subculture I see
 dominating the TV and movie industries is money  If you'll buy it
 they'll sell it  And as recent movements to boycott TV advertisers have
 shown they're very sensitive about what sells  Whatever happened to
 personal responsibility anyway  Or am I personally responsible for
 the decline in that too

To the extent that people have been encouraged to NOT be responsible
for themselves yes

    Come on  You and I both know that the major problem of this society
    today isn't a lack of employment it's a lack of people willing to work
 
   Huh  Tell that to the single mother I know who was laid off from
   her hour job at a hospital and now works  fulltime minimum
   wage jobs to barely be able to support herself and her kid  Barely
   Hey she's too proud to go on public assistance but the only jobs
   she can find are menial and with no benefits  And no career path
   eitherthey find excuses to lay people off and hire new ones rather
   than give raises and perks  And why not  It's a lot cheaper
 
  Oddly enough all the unskilled or semiskilled people I know manage
  to find employment almost immediately  Maybe she needs to move to a
  cheaper part of the country where jobs are plentiful and the cost
  of living is lower
 
 The west side of Chicago is about as cheap as it getssqualor city
 Tell me about all these places where it's cheap to live and jobs are
 abundantI'll pass them on

Sonoma County

 You live in a strange and wondrous place sir  Inexpensive housing

Not exactly cheap but not Los Angeles either

 lots of employment and utterly surrounded by socialists  Well I suppose
 that's the sort of environment that would attract socialists or at least
 not dissuade them

No it's that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists  all the
spoiled rich kids feeling guilty about their wealth  But not guilty
enough to give it away  they just look for politicians to take MY
more limited wealth away

   I see a lot of people willingnay eagerto work  What I don't see
   is a system that makes it at all feasible to do so  It's not just
   welfare which nobody enjoys but there just aren't the jobs any more
   When the US was expanding industrial capacity there was always a mill
   to go work inskills to learn a future  Now there's only McDonalds
 
  Odd  Not the experience of anyone I know  Just the opposite
 
 In California

Yup

   Mr Cramer I was there  Hippiedom was a very lowbudget operation
   Our drugs were cheap
 
  The money I was referring to was Aid to Families with Druggie 
  Cohabitators AFDC
 
 Well I doubt that much of this goes to drugsthere isn't much left after
 buying food and there is very little in the first place  Sure you read
 about such cases now and then but that's what makes them news  Show me
 your statistics about AFDC abuse

I can tell you that relatives I have known the drugs came first the
food was secondary

    Male sex survey Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
    the  percent figure that has been part of the conventional
    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are

 cannot be afforded since the insurance companies have to pay for

 We all pay because we are all part of this society and we should take

But note again the Canadian and German health insurance is voluntary

Not true I am required to have insurance by law the method of collection
effectively makes it a tax

thats why they are selfish bastards Bush and Regan gave tax breaks for the

This country is hardly ruined In fact it is booming compared to after the

 Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally
The Miami Herald April  

   Melbourne Florida    

   Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits antiabortion pickets
   within  feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice
   Even across the street they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic

   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment
   to the Constitution

   This is our sidewalk'' said Joe Carroll  a landscaper who
   marched with his children Mary Grace  and John 

   I am not a rescuer  I am not a trespasser  It's just that this is
   my sidewalk  I am not really protesting abortion  We are protesting
   denial of our rights of assembly religion speech  This judge is
   trashing the Constitution''

   The children's grandmother led them away sobbing as Carroll and
   his father were arrested

   Outside the clinic Eleanor Smeal president of the Washington
   DCbased Feminist Majority Foundation called for the Florida
   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's
   order which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties

   This cannot go on'' she said  This is not freedom of speech
   this is total psychological warfare with violence  It is ridiculous
   to have to ask clinics to go courtbycourt    to get protection''

 EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE
 
 By Richard C Paddock Times staff writer
 
 SAN FRANCISCO  Police on Thursday served search warrants on the
 AntiDefamation League here and in Los Angeles seizing evidence of a
 nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than
  political groups newspapers and labor unions and as many as
  people
 
 Describing the spy operation in great detail San Francisco
 authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how
 operatives of the AntiDefamation League searched through trash and
 infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on ArabAmerican
 rightwing and what they called pinko organizations
 
 Representatives of the AntiDefamation League a wellknown
 organization in the US Jewish community dedicated to fighting
 antiSemitism declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking
 any laws
 
 Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to
 gather political intelligence in at least seven cities including Los
 Angeles and San Francisco
 
 Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political
 spectrum including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan the White Aryan
 Resistance Operation Rescue Greenpeace the National Assn for the
 Advancement of Colored People the United Farm Workers and the Jewish
 Defense League  Also on the list were Mills College the board of
 directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San
 Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper
 
 People who were subjects of the spy operation included former
 Republican Rep Pete McCloskey jailed political extremist Lyndon H
 LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft who
 is based in South Africa
 
 Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was
 confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement
 agencies  They also alleged that data on some individuals and
 organizations was sold separately to the South African government
 
 In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from
 police the AntiDefamation League could face a total of  felony
 counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West
 Coast spy Roy Bullock according to the affidavit filed to justify
 the search warrant
 
 The AntiDefamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than
  years by funneling  a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I
 Hochman who then paid Bullock according to the documents released in
 San Francisco  Hochman a former president of the Jewish Federation
 Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax
 attorneys will be out of the city until late next week and could not
 be reached for comment his office said
 
 Until  Hochman a former US prosecutor also was a member of a
 panel appointed by thenSen Pete Wilson to secretly make initial
 recommendations on new federal judges in California  Hochman is a
 former regional president of the AntiDefamation League
 
 The league which initially cooperated with police has denied
 repeatedly that its intelligencegathering operation broke any laws
 League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an
 employee and have said they simply traded information with police
 departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes
 
 But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches
 San Francisco police alleged that ADL employees were apparently less
 than truthful in providing information during an earlier search
 conducted without a warrant
 
 David Lehrer executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office said
 the organization has not violated the law  There is nothing
 nefarious about how we operate or what we have done he said  Our
 record speaks for itself
 
 The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret
 fund used to pay for factfinding operations  Lehrer according to
 the documents signed checks from the account under the name L
 Patterson
 
 An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to
 a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending
 them directly to the AntiDefamation League
 
 Bullock  who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for
 nearly  years defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with
 San Francisco police  He said that he gathered names from many
 sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as
 Skins and Pinkos but that did not necessarily mean that they were
 under surveillance
 
 I might never see or call up on  of them again Bullock said
 And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files  It's not a
 threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under
 say 'Pinko'
 
 In recent years Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police
 Officer Tom Gerard who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he
 was questioned by the FBI in the case
 
 A former CIA employee Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records
 and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses
 vehicle registration physical characteristics and drivers license
 photographs
 
 Using files gathered for the AntiDefamation League Gerard and
 Bullock also provided information to the South African government
 receiving  over four years the documents show
 
 The file on Times staff writer Kraft which was apparently sold to the
 South African government provides some insight into the hitandmiss
 nature of the spy operation
 
 The file notes that Kraft's articles appear frequently in The Times
 and are well researched and written but little else about the file
 is accurate  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another
 Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong
 Kraft's physical description photograph and other personal
 information
 
 Nevertheless the documents provide illuminating details of how
 Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations from
 skinheads to leftwing radicals searching regularly through the trash
 of target groups  Using AntiDefamation League funds he also ran his
 own paid informants under code names such as Scott and Scumbag
 
 He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast
 exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies
 including the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
 
 It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI  while spying
 on behalf of the AntiDefamation League and the South African
 government  that proved his undoing The FBI learned that he was an
 agent of a foreign government and began investigating leading to the
 probe of the AntiDefamation League's intelligence network  The
 AntiDefamation League employed undercover operatives to gather
 information in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Washington
 Chicago St Louis and Atlanta according to the affidavit and
 investigators  Joining San Francisco police in searching league
 offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of
 San Francisco Dist Atty Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax
 Board  The Los Angeles Police Department which earlier refused to
 cooperate with the investigation was informed of the searches in Los
 Angeles but not invited to participate  Investigators suspect that
 some confidential information in the AntiDefamation League files may
 have come from Los Angeles police officers

 ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION
 
 By Richard C Paddock Times staff writer
 
 SAN FRANCISCO  The AntiDefamation League defended its record as a
 civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities
 who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential
 police information on citizens and groups
 
 But San Francisco Dist Atty Arlo Smith said that AntiDefamation
 League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many
 felony counts of receiving confidential files eavesdropping tax
 violations and conspiracy
 
 Police have accused the AntiDefamation League of not being truthful
 about its spying operations which collected information on more than
  individuals and  political groups across the political
 spectrum
 
 Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show
 that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept
 files on political figures
 
 Even so Smith suggested that if the AntiDefamation League shut down
 its spy operation prosecutors would take that into account when
 deciding what charges to file
 
 In a statement released in Washington National Director Abraham H
 Foxman described the ADL as a Jewish defense agency which has fought
 to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 
 years
 
 Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on
 extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing
 information to police journalists academics government officials
 and the public  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain
 information illegally he said
 
 Like other journalists in order to protect the confidentiality and
 physical safety of its sources ADL will not comment on the nature or
 identity of any source of information Foxman said
 
 The AntiDefamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its
 longtime employees Roy Bullock was anything more than a private
 individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant'
 
 Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements
 showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through
 Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I Hochman
 
 Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be
 distanced from ADL Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator
 Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment
 
 Despite the AntiDefamation League's assertion that it will cooperate
 with authorities San Francisco police said the group did not turn
 over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's
 offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall
 
 A second round of searches Thursday this time with search warrants
 produced a vast quantity of records primarily dealing with financial
 transactions Smith said  Further searches may be necessary and it
 will be at least a month before any charges are filed he said
 
 The investigation of course will go wherever the facts lead us
 the district attorney said

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS

                          The Briefing Room



 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Good afternoon  
	     
	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That would be nice  Let's go out 
to the cherry blossoms  We'll do like the President
	     
	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely not  
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks  You 
said it was a good visit but no compromise
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes  The President had a good talk 
with Senator Dole last night  I think that as we said before there 
were no specific compromises on either side although it was a very 
good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as 
well  As you know the President first called Senator Dole I believe 
Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package  They did not 
speak  Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning  when the 
President was out  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake and at the close 
of that conversation indicated that he wanted to speak to the 
President about the jobs and stimulus package  They finally talked 
about that yesterday afternoon
	     
	     At the close of that discussion they said that they 
would have another talk last night which they did when the Senator 
was up in New Hampshire  And although there were no specific 
compromises made on either side they did say that they would 
continue to have some discussions  And that's where we are
	     
	     Q	  Well who is giving in  Where is it standing are 
both making concessions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know that it's at that 
phase  No compromise has been made  As the President has said 
consistently he intends to come forward with an adjusted package  
He believes in the package but he believes that if it's going to 
take adjustments to get the minority to release it he's willing to 
make those adjustments
	     
	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh boy
	     
	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sure
	     
	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes 
	     
	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made but what would 
lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sorry Andrea I'm not going to go 
down that road  No decisions have been made  As the President said 
this morning a number of groups a number of members of Congress a 
number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked 
at  The working group is looking at it but no decisions have been 
made
	     
	     Q	  To follow have they done that directly through 
him  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President 
about it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not to my knowledge although 
there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the 
VAT  But the President has not made a decision
	     
	     Q	  At the meetings that he's had with his own task 
force advisers have they discussed the funding issue and what the 
possible options would be
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think that that has been 
presented for a decision no
	     
	     Q	  Not for a decision but has it been discussed as an 
option
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again there are a lot of levels of 
briefing  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the 
President as okay this is something for you to decide on  
	     
	     Q	  You're not saying he didn't know it was being 
considered though are you
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No he said it's being considered
	     
	     Q	  He knew that
	     
	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers  
That's what I'm asking
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has said it's being 
considered  I do not know what level of discussion there has been 
over the VAT  It is something the working groups are looking at  I 
don't even know that it's 
	     
	     Q	  But he didn't say he was considering did he at 
this stage
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No he is not  I think we're 
getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here  What is 
considered  
	     
	     Q	  Well he is the one who said I haven't reviewed 
it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That is true  That is what I just 
repeated 
	     
	     Q	  George is there any concern here that as a result 
of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if 
it were to be considered he'd let us know and having it trickle out 
the way it did that there may now be the development of a 
credibility gap on this issue and others
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think so  I mean it is 
now public knowledge that this is being considered
	     
	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute 
statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it 
was off the table and was not being considered and then to have it 
come out not from you people but 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well wait a second  It came out 
from the administration  What are you talking about
	     
	     Q	  What I'm saying is though that the President said 
he would let us know 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right
	     
	     Q	  You people then said  you said I believe that 
it's not going to be on the program
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  On March th
	     
	     Q	  On March th 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Circumstances change
	     
	     Q	  Well I understand  But we have to find that out 
by rooting around in the fine print of an interview
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Rooting around  I know you did do 
a very good job there to read the USA Today article  But this is 
laughter  the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services  I mean that is common anytime you guys 
write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the 
Clinton administration the headline is  I'll look at it right 
here and AP story  Clinton wants more money for spying
	     
	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being 
considered he'd tell us about it  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  And the administration's concerned 
and he'd let you know
	     
	     Q	  And did he
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes  Absolutely  What did he say 
this morning
	     
	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It didn't have to be dragged out of 
me  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB we had the Secretary of 
Health of Human Services say it was being considered  That is his 
administration  That is his administration policy
	     
	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons or were they 
orchestrated leaks  I mean what was the 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They were asked questions they 
answered the questions
	     
	     Q	  You're saying here that it didn't have to be 
dragged out that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were 
considering it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely  I was very clear  
Painfully clear
	     
	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making 
it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax 
day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No it was just this issue is being 
considered  They were asked if it was being considered they 
answered that it was being considered
	     
	     Q	  George The New York Times 
	     
	     Q	  Why do it yesterday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They were asked
	     
	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary 
Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and 
oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures 
in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill 
but which turned out to be totally false
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if it was totally 
false but I think  laughter  the chief economist at the Labor 
Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing and they 
say that 
	     
	     Q	  The question is is the President concerned about 
behavior that amounts to corrupting government data  And what's he 
doing about it if so
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The chief economist has said that a 
mistake was made it won't happen again and that's the end of the 
matter
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that the same information that goes to the 
President
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  There's two separate pieces of 
information  I think that's where the confusion was
	     
	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake 
that was made
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I read the article this morning
	     
	     Q	  And as far as you know is the President aware of 
it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think so
	     
	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in 
The New York Times
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know  Not to my knowledge
	     
	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning  
Anything
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I didn't
	     
	     Q	  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on 
this for his own purpose  For his speeches for his arguments
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well again I'm not sure  Both 
statements are true  What the Labor Department has granted is that 
mixing them in one sentence essentially was misleading  They said 
it was a mistake  They said they wouldn't do it again
	     
	     Q	  Did they drop it  is this something that you 
choose to spin or make an issue of
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Whenever fewer people are out of 
work we're gratified  But that doesn't take away from the need to 
get this jobs package going
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a 
minute  You said that the President plans to come forward with an 
amendment  Is the timetable still what it was  that the amendment 
would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday or did he in 
the conversation with Dole talk about the possibility of putting 
that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think at this point there's no 
changes in the schedule at all  I don't know that they discussed the 
timing like that
	     
	     Q	  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer 
this week than you were last week
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I believe that we're going 
to pass a jobs package  The President is prepared to make 
adjustments in order to get that to happen  I don't know where the 
votes are on cloture at this particular time  I don't know what's 
going to happen until we have a vote  But the President believes 
deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done
	     
	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation 
has changed
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We're going to continue to work on 
it  We'll know when the votes are taken
	     
	     Q	  George last week you said that there are  or 
various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go 
through Dole you were going to have to try and go around him because 
he was immovable on this subject of a compromise or at least the 
compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could 
accept  This week you're talking to him  Is that because you've 
realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's because Senator Dole wanted 
to talk to the President about the stimulus package
	     
	     Q	  He initiated the conversation
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that in fact 
the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all  You 
say he's making 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know that that's exactly 
what he said  I think he said he didn't have any indication that 
there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise 
and the President doesn't want to compromise  And the President 
doesn't want to compromise  But if he has to make adjustments to get 
it through he will
	     
	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was 
working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before 
the actual vote
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's possible
	     
	     Q	  Today
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not sure exactly when that will 
happen but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward 
with some sort of a different package or Senate Democrats will come 
forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it 
passed
	     
	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole the 
first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you 
tonight with some details or some adjustments or whatever the phrase 
is  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think it's a question of how 
detailed  I mean I think they had a general discussion about the 
package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday 
afternoon  I believe that there will be followup discussions today 
in the Senate not necessarily between the President and Senator 
Dole  And let me just reiterate neither side has made specific 
compromises at this date  When we have something we'll let you know  
And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that 
we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way
	     
	     Q	  What are the followup discussions if not the 
President and Dole
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think Senator Mitchell is going 
to talk to Senator Dole
	     
	     Q	  Is that a threat  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole all right 
how about this number as an overall size or did Dole say to the 
President I can go as high as this  Did they talk numbers
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think it was a negotiation 
in that respect  It was more of a discussion about their positions
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm just not sure  I know they 
talked about the basic outlines of the packages  I think they talked 
about the programs they cared about  I don't know if they got to the 
level of this many xbillion dollars 
	     
	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a 
package
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No of course not
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the 
protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole 
was speaking  Was that in any way organized by 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not to my knowledge no
	     
	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators 
Kohl or Feingold  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think he's talked to them 
no
	     
	     Q	  George is the President considering the more 
palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the 
haves having to continuously pay for the havenots  And is he going 
to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few with the haves 
having to pay for the havenots
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes deeply that 
the tax rates on upper income Americans as he presented in his 
budget should go up  And I think for the second half of your 
question I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday
	     
	     Q	  George on the subject of accuracy in information 
you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money 
that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee  Apparently that is 
not true  It's actually waste water money
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's waste water money for 
Wisconsin and some could go to Milwaukee 
	     
	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem 
because it's waste water money right
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It would affect the water treatment 
overall 
	     
	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other 
day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now  
Would you agree that's not the case
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not sure of the specifics  I 
know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin
	     
	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning which was 
when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating 
on a VAT
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not sure exactly when  I just 
don't know  I assume it came up over the last  certainly between 
the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago  
	     
	     Q	  So sometime since March th
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that's right  I don't know 
the exact date
	     
	     Q	  George the President this morning mentioned that 
some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax  Apparently the 
National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax 
being okay if it replaces the BTU tax  So does the President feel 
that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed 
or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already 
proposed  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think we've said all we have to 
say about the VAT at this point  I mean there's just no  this is 
being considered by the health care working groups and that is all  
The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that 
	     
	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care it wouldn't 
be to replace some other tax that finances  it wouldn't replace the 
income tax for instance
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  There have been no discussions on 
that
	     
	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress 
Senator Dole's press release today said VAT  on tax day  Do you 
think  does it have a chance of getting through Congress  Would it 
have a chance
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I have no idea 
	     
	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it 
forward
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That would become a consideration 
if the President were to decide to do it  It's not in consideration 
now
	     
	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that 
circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under 
consideration
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes what the President referred to 
this morning  These groups came forward and said this is something 
that has to be considered
	     
	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed  
That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled 
it out that groups have asked it to be considered
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's what he said 
	     
	     Q	  Is that true
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Was there in fact some understanding that sin 
taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not going to get into the 
deliberations
	     
	     Q	  But George 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  What the consideration is as 
the President said groups came forward and said this is something 
you ought to consider  The working groups are looking at it 
	     
	     Q	  Is that the only thing that's changed since his 
prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups  how that 
information got to him that groups wanted it  Was it just reading 
the newspaper or did groups make presentations
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the groups  as you know 
the health care task force has met with dozens of groups
	     
	     Q	  But this is the President's knowledge that these 
groups had come forward
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think he was referring to what 
was coming to the working groups  Obviously there have also been 
published positions in the newspapers
	     
	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's 
presentations to them
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if they've briefed him 
 I mean how detailed the briefings have been    I know that the 
working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these 
groups
	     
	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that 
were persuasive enough that the President would change the position 
that he had enunciated previously
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know it's just they've had 
longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance 
health care
	     
	     Q	  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding 
positions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He may have been at some level  
Obviously he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the 
basic arguments for and against a VAT tax
	     
	     Q	  What we're trying to figure out here  you're 
telling us that the only change the only thing that affected this 
change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February 
and now 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President's attitude hasn't 
necessarily changed  I mean he has not made a decision
	     
	     Q	  I know but the President said that it was off the 
table  So did you  And you're saying that the only thing that's 
changed is the positions of these groups except you're also 
describing them as longstanding positions  I don't see the change  
If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been 
made to the President 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well they've made the 
presentations to the health care task force
	     
	     Q	  There's no relationship at all between the fact 
that sin taxes that he had said  suggested in February that he 
favored will not produce enough revenue to finance 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think he ever suggested 
that they would produce all the revenue
	     
	     Q	  Well he suggested that he thought that those were 
appropriate ways to finance health care
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He did say that  I don't know that 
he said anything to refute that
	     
	     Q	  But in fact has the task force discovered that 
there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind 
of core benefits 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I don't think that the task 
force ever suggested that there would
	     
	     Q	  George if he advocated a VAT tax would that break 
his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his 
programs
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I can't comment on a hypothetical 
situation
	     	  
	     Q	  But does that promise  would that promise not to 
raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him 
from seeking a VAT tax
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has made no decisions 
on the VAT tax  When he does we'll tell you and we'll explain the 
implications then
	     
	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite  business 
labor or otherwise  whose recommendations to the health care task 
force has prompted this consideration
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't have the specific  I just 
don't have that
	     
	     Q	  George can you tell us to what extend these other 
alternatives for instance the employer tax or the sin taxes or 
other financing options are also still on the table and what these 
options are
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No as members of the task force 
and representatives of the working groups have said they are looking 
at a wide variety of options  I think that Ira Magaziner said that 
there are  different options under consideration  But I'm not 
going to comment 
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm just not going to comment on 
them no
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope of the need  How much are you 
talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's what the health care task 
force is looking at
	     
	     Q	  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the 
Miyazawa visit two questions  One generally what does the 
President hope to use that meeting for but more specifically is his 
task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and 
the remark about market access at the press conference
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The Vancouver note
	     
	     Q	  Does no mean yes
	     
	     Q	  Yes and no
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I don't know  I saw the 
Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question 
about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when 
he was asked the question  The questions of trade are something that 
certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the 
President  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and 
the US that we want to do something about
	     
	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he 
suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in 
terms of trade  Are you going to oblige  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   I think the President will state 
our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit 
very clearly  I don't necessarily want to agree with your 
characterization of the Prime Minister's comments
	     
	     Q	     that we need specific export targets specific 
numerical targets  is that what he's going to discuss with 
Miyazawa
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They're going to have a broad 
discussion of a wide range of trade issues  I don't want to get into 
those specifics until after the meeting
	     
	     Q	  Why
	     
	     Q	   That's the crux of the issue right  Whether or 
not  does the President believe that without specific numerical 
targets it is really as he said in his press conference sort of 
hopeless that this is going to change very much
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes that we must 
have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around  I do not 
want to get into the specifics of how that would be done
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus 
package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think first the President wants 
to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister 
Miyazawa himself and then he'll make the comment on it
	     
	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package  There seems to 
be some confusion about how the US views that Secretary 
Christopher saying  or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do 
more the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again we're going to continue to 
work with all our allies in the G and we're going to continue to 
press for help for Russian reform Russian democratic reform  And I 
think that so far we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and 
we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral 
packages
	     
	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We're going to continue to work 
with all our allies to do as much as we can
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today 
Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on 
the Bosnia policy  And he said It's a rather emotional response  
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Over an emotional issue
	     
	     Q	  Right  to an emotional problem  Does the White  
House condone that kind of remark
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that Secretary 
Christopher's remarks speaks for itself  The President believes also 
that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find 
answers for 
	     
	     Q	  But that specific  rather emotional response  
specific term
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No it speaks for itself
	     
	     Q	  In connection with that doesn't it seem that with 
the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment is it 
good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now 
to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  For example
	     
	     Q	  To take stronger action to take military action  
air strikes anything that can be done
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes that what 
must be done now is to push harder for sanctions  He is also  as 
you know the administration has been discussing lifting the arms 
embargo  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase 
pressure at this time
	     
	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say 
that the US is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain 
the presidency
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They're wrong  We're pressing hard 
for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table  We're pressing hard 
for increased sanctions and we're talking to our allies about the 
arms embargo
	     
	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen 
getting people to agree to that  Now Vance and Owen have both said 
that military force to some extent would be acceptable  Does that 
change your thinking
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Clearly we're going to listen to 
whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to 
say  But at this point the President is moving forward on sanctions 
and talking about the arms embargo
	     
	     Q	  A followup on a Dee Dee comment this morning  She 
said she would be able to provide some administration officials who 
could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia  Are 
you going to be able to do that or do you have anything 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think that's what she said
	     
	     Q	  That's exactly what she said
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think that's true  But 
what she said  we would look into the situation of what kind of 
evidence can be provided in Bosnia  Obviously if there are 
connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and 
we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade that will have 
an effect over time  I do not know day by day minute by minute 
what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact 
effect has been   But clearly we are slowing the shipment of goods 
into Belgrade  We are having an effect on the Serbs there  What 
kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't 
know  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at 
all I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much
	     
	     Q	  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be 
released
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think there's a joint tax return  
And it will be probably later today
	     
	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive 
order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work 
force as part of the gay rights march here next week
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think there's any proposal 
for that at this time not that I know of
	     
	     Q	  It's something that the President promised during 
the campaign that he would do
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I have not seen any  I don't 
think it's anything that's on his plate right now
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point 
on this issue
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know about on this issue  
I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian 
community sometime soon as he meets with representatives of lots of 
different groups and communities
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if that's scheduled 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's probably going to be tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  It's a good thing you asked
	     
	     Q	  Who's probably going to be there  Laughter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know
	     
	     Q	  How long 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know  That's all I know
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if it's at  pm tomorrow  
Laughter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know what time it is  I 
don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major 
speech next week of some kind  Is that going to happen do you know
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if they've asked but 
I think the President has always planned as he did last year to 
give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will  If it's not 
exactly on Earth Day it might be a day before or something like 
that
	     
	     Q	  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of 
the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I don't know the specific 
timing of something like that but it's certainly something under 
discussion and something we've been working on
	     
	     Q	  Campaign finance reform
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We're working on it
	     
	     Q	  Do you think it will be next week
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm just not sure
	     
	     Q	  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working 
on  I missed the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes something we're working on  
He asked if it was ready to be signed and I said I didn't know 
anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working 
on
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what organizations might be represented 
in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out 
of town on the day of the march
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He's got to be at the Senate 
meeting in Jamestown and I believe he's also going to be giving a 
speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston 
on Sunday as he did last year
	     
	     Q	  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you 
on the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  On what
	     
	     Q	  On the gays
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  When we went through the 
President's schedule for the day certainly
	     
	     Q	    George what day is the publisher's speech  Is 
that Sunday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think it's a Sunday
	     
	     Q	  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one 
day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No I'm not sure  I don't know how 
long the Senate thing goes  It might go overnight  I just don't 
know
	     
	     Q	  You would have made the gay meeting public right
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm certain if we had the meeting 
 I don't know about open to the press but we would have told you 
about it
	     
	     Q	  I mean because it is as far as I can tell the 
first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with   

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I didn't say it was going to be in 
the Oval Office  Laughter  But I didn't  I'm not say that it's 
not but I didn't say that it was  Laughter
	     
	     Q	     at the White House in the Bush administration 
gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White 
House had to repudiate having done that  So I just wanted to make 
sure 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the President wouldn't do 
anything like that
	     
	     Q	  Certainly not
	     
	     Q	  What marching orders did the President give to 
General Vessey
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They had a very good discussion for 
about half an hour today  He wanted  the most important thing was 
he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs  He will 
obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document  
The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting 
and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes 
in our policy towards Vietnam  He'll be looking at Vietnam's 
response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look 
into investigations on discrepancy cases increased efforts on 
remains implementing trilateral investigations  and access to 
military archives  
	     
	     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the 
activities of the joint commission and on the document
	     
	     Q	  Vietnam says it's a fake  What is the DOD analysis 
at this stage
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's not completed yet and it's 
also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the 
Vietnamese
	     
	     Q	  A number of Defense officials have been saying that 
they think that the  or so prisoners referred to are in fact 
nonAmericans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to 
as Americans from time to time  Do people  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We don't have any final 
determination  We're going to wait for the complete review when we 
have it we'll make a judgment
	     
	     Q	  I know you don't have any final determination but 
given all of the intense public interest in this do you think that 
that's a likely possibility
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I just don't want to characterize 
it in any way until the review is complete
	     
	     Q	  George was there a topic scheduled for the speech 
in Boston
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No 
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to have a press conference 
tomorrow with Miyazawa
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think so but I'm not positive  
Yes I expect yes
	     
	     Q	  Was Toon in with Vessey  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes 
	     
	     Q	  He was in on the meeting
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  What was the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey 
and the answer is yes 
	     
	     Q	  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal 
report this morning the President's distressed about some of his 
press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  Well I do have a response  I 
think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied 
that the President has had restricted access to the press  I would 
point out that he's answered  questions on  occasions more than 
any of his predecessors I would also point out it also 
	     
	     Q	  How many questions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Three hundred fiftyeight on  
occasions
	     
	     Q	  How many were while he was jogging
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well no that's actually a very 
good question Andrea  And I would point out further that the 
article also implied that these questions were only answered at 
tightly controlled photo opportunities which is just patently false  
He's had  press conferences in either the East Room the Oval 
Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room in addition to 
questions taken at photo opportunities and that is only the 
	     
	     Q	  Oval Office press conference  when was that 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He's answered questions in the 
East Room  He's had five in the East Room he's had one in the Oval 
Office he's had one in the Rose Garden he's had one or two in the 
Roosevelt Room  And this is just to the White House Washington 
Press Corps  In addition to that he's had  interviews with local 
television anchors  He's met with the editorial board of The 
Portland Oregonian  He's had an hourlong interview with Dan Rather 
He's had interviews with local press from California Florida and 
Connecticut 
	     
	     Q	  Can you address the question of the attitude  The 
article implies that he doesn't 
	     
	     Q	  Why doesn't he like us  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Did you really get blamed for that Post story
	     
	     Q	  The story is that you  are you held responsible 
for it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think I'm going to comment 
about this
	     
	     Q	  Are you denying that the President has shown 
displeasure publicly
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I am not commenting on the 
discussions between the President and myself
	     
	     Q	  Did the President write that letter to Chris 
Webber
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  What
	     
	     Q	  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball 
player
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh yes
	     
	     Q	  That is an authentic letter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Since the President first talked about the VAT in 
February he said at the time that he thought there probably should 
be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing  
Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I just can't comment on a 
proposal he hasn't made
	     
	     Q	  George does the President have some agenda for 
this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I think it will just a 
general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about 
including AIDS and other issues  civil rights
	     
	     Q	  The military issue
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm certain it will come up
	     
	     Q	  Is he using this event to name the AIDS 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think so
	     
	     Q	  George what specifically is the President doing to 
prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He's had briefing memos  He's had 
general discussions with members of the Treasury Department the 
Trade Representative and others
	     
	     Q	     report yet
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if he has the report 
referred to in The Times but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him 
today
	     
	     Q	  He was
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Does he intend to use any of these instances that 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I don't know that the 
report's been presented  But obviously the President will press 
hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred
	     
	     Q	  In terms of the Wall Street Journal the thrust was 
that there's a real schism here  a hostility  Do you think he 
feels that way
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not at all  As I said on the 
record in the article I think the President likes reporters  Again 
I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading  The 
thrust of the article was that in some way some attitude which the 
President may or may not have is affecting access when in fact he 
has the most open accessible administration than have any in recent 
history

	     Q	  Can we come up to your office  Laughter

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  If you're invited  
	     
	     THE PRESS  Thank you

                                 END                     PM EDT

                      Yigal et al sue ADL
 
  Nineteen people including the son off ormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe 
 Arens sued the AntiDefamation League ADL on Wednesday accusing the 
 Jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them
 
     Richard Hirschhaut director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL art
 dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as
 defendants in the suit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court
 
     The  accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith a group dedicated to fighting
 antiSemitism and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on
 them including data from state and federal agencies
 
     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others including the
 governments of Israel and South Africa in what it alleges was a a massive
 spying operation''
 
     The action is a classaction suit It was filed on behalf of about 
 antiapartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the
 plaintiffs believe the ADL Bullock and Gerard gathered information
 
     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately 
 available for comment on Wednesday
 
     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that
 Gerard a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit
 passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy
 ring
 
     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL Bullock and
 Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San
 Francisco and Los Angeles
 
     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California
 which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official 
 sources  It seeks exemplary damages of at least  per person as well as 
 other unspecified damages
     
 Lawyer Pete McCloskey a former Congresmen who is representing the
 plaintiffs said the  plaintiffs included ArabAmericans and Jews  and 
 his wife Helen who also had information gathered about her
 
     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens a research scientist at the
 University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence
 Minister
 
     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on
 him in the s presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of
 Palestinians and his position on the Israelioccupied territories
 
     According to court documents released last week Bullock and Gerard both
 kept information on thousands of California political activists
 
     In the documents a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid
 Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and
 Bullock received confidential information from the authorities
 
     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case The ADL Bullock and

    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders 
    usually   and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue
    and air fresheners says a new survey

    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds
    statistically significant increases in eighthgraders' use of
    many drugs including marijuana cocaine crack LSD and inhalants

    We may be in danger of losing some  hardwon ground in reducing
    drug use as a new more naive generation of youngsters enters
    adolescence says Lloyd Johnston University of Michigan chief
    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and
    Human Services

    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decadelong
    decline

    The study of  students shows the percentage who tried the
    following in the  days before they were polled

         thgraders   alcohol  cigarettes  marijuana 
                         cocaine 

         thgraders  alcohol  cigarettes  marijuana 
                         cocaine 

         thgraders  alcohol  cigarettes  marijuana 
                         cocaine 

    Among thgraders use of marijuana cocaine and inhalants
    declined over the year before  Not so with LSD

      of eighthgraders have tried LSD in the last year up 
    over  

     Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since  
    tried it in the last year

    Reducing drug use among students requires a different kind of
    strategy that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part
    of an overall illness prevention plan

    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighthgraders
    disapprove of them

    It's scary Shalala says  Dealers are focusing on younger more
    vulnerable kids

The DEA and other organizations would have the American people
believe that we are winning the war on drugs  I'm going to
dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing
you the drug war's real status To help prove my assertions
I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly
demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups is on the
rise  If WOD is working as we're led to believe then drug
abuse should have gone down substantially by now  The reality
is is that it has not gone down very much  If anything
substance abuse is on the rise  I'm also going to supply a
possible solution to this problem

The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music
and pot entitled Hello Again Mary Jane which appears in the
current issue of Time magazine April   p 

    Lawenforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing
    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed  Perhaps
    because of the change of administrations the marijuana lobby
    is out in full force says Robert Bonner head of the Drug
    Enforcement Administration  The fact is they're losing the
    battle  In  more than  of youths ages  to  said
    they smoked marijuana in  that figure was  and Bonner
    says it is still falling  Bonner also offers a reminder that
    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of
    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage

     report

We are not winning the war on drugs  I think you can see that one
of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that
the war on drugs is being won is to selectively quote statistics
only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone
down  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is
an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to
deceive the public

Usage of one particular drug may have gone down but at the same
time usage of other drugs may have gone up aka substitution
Also drug usage among one particular age group may have gone down
but drug usage among another age group may have gone up  Therefore
if one takes a look at the big picture taking into consideration all
the statistics then it's obvious that the socalled war on drugs is
being lost  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs
go but if one factors in alcohol abuse smoking and use of inhalants
then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed
in its true perspective

For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try
drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me
that it's not a drug  Agencies like the DEA only go after illegal
drugs  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless
attempt at preventing substance abusepeople will merely switch to
another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular

The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to
legalize somenot alldrugs whose toxicity has been shown to be
within reasonable limits you won't drop dead after using it a few
times and then couple this with a massive drug education program
The reason why I think legalization is part of the solution is
because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the
government's efforts to the contrarythe money spent on drug
interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere eg drug
education  Additionally legalization would reduce crime because
the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often
goes along with other kinds of crime  Not to mention the fact that
addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their
money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit
legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall
substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts

IMHO the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been
done to smokers  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to
employ heavyhanded law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating
them  As you already know people in the US smoke a lot less than
they used to  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought
about by public awareness campaigns laws restricting where people can
light up warning labels on cigarette packages taxation on tobacco in
order to reduce consumption and so on  I propose that similar methods
be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried
out  They are as follows

     Drugs being sold must come with clear concise information which
      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this
      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used
      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used
      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in

     All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of
      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs
      through illegal channels  Part of the revenue collected from
      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law
      enforcement

     Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors people under the age of
        Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the
      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent
      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning
      information should also be a felony

     Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the
      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible  This
      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad
      drugssomething that is a fairly serious problem now

I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have
been hashed out before in this newsgroup  Nevertheless I thought
it was a good idea to give my two cents actually a buck and a half
all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on
WOD  Go ahead and tear into my post I'm sure there is something in it
that you may wish to take a different view on or flame     BTW
I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my
assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths
something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in

issue of USA Today Drug Use Up Among US eighthgraders by Mike
Snider p D

    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get more teens are
    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky 

    For the last two years government officials have trumpeted results
    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is
    being won  But this year officials are retreating  drug use by
    eighthgraders has risen according to the survey of  students
    nationwide

    Possible reason for the increase  more experimentation  Why  If
    drug use dropped during the 's eventually some students will
    have fewer drugusing contemporaries who act as examples of
    substance abuse's drawbacks says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston
    one of the survey authors  Each new wave of youths must be given
    the knowledge skills and motivation to resist using these drugs
    Johnston says

    This type of resurgence is possible says Eileen Shiff author of
    Experts Advise Parents Delta   But that's not the issue
    she says  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today
    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now

    Aggravating the problem  baby boomer parents  who experimented with
    drugs and alcohol as teens  trying to be friends not parents to
    their children  I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer to
    their underage kids and friends Shiff says  For a recent graduation
    Shiff and other parents organized an allnight lockin party where
    no booze or drugs were allowed  We need to fulfill that parental
    role otherwise the peer group takes over she says

    Officials may talk about the war on drugs but they really haven't
    done anything that I've seen says Suzanne Linkous Scottsdale
    Ariz  a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs dating and
    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line  Linkous a
    member of USA Today's Teen Panel says there's always going to be
    experimentation with drugs

    A real war on drugs could be waged educationwise she says  But
    some don't want to give kids the facts  They think it will give
    them ideas it's the same with birth control  I think you should
    give the kids the information or have it accessible through classes
    pamphlets and speakers she says

    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school  in
    kindergarten says Dallas Owens  teen panelist from Miami Shores
    Fla  I remember in kindergarten I used to see drugs  I think
    kids in the th and th grades have already made up their minds
    about using drugs he says

    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working only
    one commercial has gotten it right he says  The commercial opens
    with two goodlooking girls in the restroom talking about having
    no prom date  Then they take a hit off a joint  That hits home
    because it's not attractive he says  You can't be doing drugs if
    you want somebody to like you

Clayton my man

You are a tad out of touch

First gay comunities all over the country are in the process of excluding NAMBLA
from parades etc



Nobody from NAMBLA is gonna get a job in a day care centre  The same liberals you are
upset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcare
people



Tell me how would you feel if your employer fired you for your antigay post on the
internet  Would you be upset   Ill bet you would be pissed
To some your posts ight make the company look bad
While your posts offend me I dont think it would be right for you to get fired over
it

I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative
action laws of the 's did
My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights
have  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord
finds out they are gay  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of
a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired
Do you REALLY think these are justified 



Clayton I am told you are a parent a couple times over
Have you been following the strip in the paper For Better or For Worse 

I honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip  

Do you really care about your childeren
as much as friends of mine tell me   How much do you care about your childeren 
How much do you care about other people's childeren  Do you care about MY childeren
Do you care about my sister's childeren 

If one of your kids told you heshe was gay would you throw them out of your home
in the middle of the night

Would you approve of your childeren driving down to San Francisco to trow bottles
at and beat up on gay people  Would you condone your childeren beating up on someone
elses childeren 


I await your answers to these queastions  PLease no flaming
This is to be a civilised discussion from one father to another

and you think the defense made a good case No wonder we're losing 
We're aparently not trying to win
 
 The clip I saw was even worse than that The defense attorney was asking
 something like what have you done to serve YOUR country as compared to
 these fine upstanding examples of patriotism
 
 I didn't see the response I don't think it was shown on TV I wish the
 response had been I vote I pay taxes I pay my salary I support the Bill
 of Rights unlike you Counselor
 
 In my dreams 
 
 Now the real question is could this be a federal civil rights case since
 the state case was a sham Sound like a wellknown Los Angeles trial Probably
 not fags and dykes aren't protected for being fags and dykes under civil
 rights laws
 

I would doubt any civil rights case would be in order for the point that you
mentioned  Even if it were possible I think it is a bad idea since it smacks
real strongly of double jeopardy  A civil case for damages is fine since that
is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first  I think a bad precedent
has already been set in the King trial in LA and something like this would
make it worse  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision it
must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three
marines and that's how it should stand

   Abortion in many cases is a choice birth is a necessary function to keep
   our population alive  To those who disagree with abortion I am sure cost
   is not a major factor

Make you the same deal I offered Doug  You and the rest of the prolifers
on this net can pay all prenatal and child bearing costs for those poor 
who want to have children and the prochoicers on the net will pay for the
abortions of the poor who don't want to have children  Deal

A more realistic offer would be

Those who object to paying for abortion can instead pay for the greater
cost of delivery that those who couldn't afford an abortion and wanted
one would be forced to go through while those of us who do not object to
public funding of abortions for those who can not afford medical care on
their own can pay for the smaller cost of an abortion for those who
decide that is what is best for them but are unable to afford it on their
own  Funny how those who object to paying their money to pay for other's
abortions end up paying more money than if they hadn't objected  People
need to realize that where your individual tax money goes is a meaningless
concept  It is probably unlikely that the fraction of your taxes that would
actually on average go towards such abortions would cover the cost of even
one entire abortion  Consider how many taxpayers there are how many
abortions are performed and how many would likely be paid for by public
funds and how much you pay in taxes and how much a typical abortion would
cost  I think the factors on the order of  involved will swamp the
rest

It's more realistic because we don't really object to paying for delivery
etc for those women who chose that but can't afford it

 These two paragraphs are from two different posts  In splicing them 
  together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent
  him in any way  I don't think I've done so 

As noted in another thread Limiting govt the problem libertarians face
is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the 
tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda
 
It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams  Just
as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition

Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois USA requiring
anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year X   I think
to become licensed as a used car dealer  In addition it requirs anyone
with a used car dealer's license to own at least  cars at a time all the
time 

Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions

Steve let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell
cars  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump
up against these limits or you would like to do it fulltime but these
stupid arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling
yourself up  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing
to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs and you're
protected from doing what you want with your life

Here's what I see libertarianism offering you

Your money is truly yours it belongs to you  You can use it to buy a car
If you use it to buy a car it is truly your car it belongs to you  You
can use your money to fix up that car  Since it is your car you can sell
that car

Your life is truly yours it belongs to you  It matters not if someone
thinks that it's wrong for you to buy and sell  cars within  months
rather than say  cars  They may dissaprove but it is not their life or
their money it is your life and your money

My money is truly mine it belongs to me  I can use it to buy a car
Perhaps your car  Perhaps that th car the one that someone somewhere
dissaproves of you selling and presumably of me buying

That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make
us stop it  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing
what we like with our own property in the abscence of fraud or agression
And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other

This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream but basic human decency
and common sense  A real grassroots example of freedom and liberty
And yes not having a few people acting as our masters approving or
rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other does strike me
as a wonderful way to improve the human condition

   Thanks awfully
             Patrick

Here's my own top ten response to Mr Ipser's list

   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work
     to provide the services that people need and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved  Granted some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money and should be  But some things are going to
     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time  You want to live in my country you pay your fair
     share

Some people pay shares that are more fair than others and will continue
to do so even with the presence of President Clinton  Until the rich 
elite hurt from taxes and shower me with their blood dripping from the
wound of the tax dagger I will scream and yell  Because taxes are 
killing the poor and middleclass and I'm tired of the wealthy getting
a free ride in this country  Sure they pay a lot of taxes but I want
them to SHARE MY PAIN

And not even Slick Willy is that fair is he seeing that he and his
wife qualify as one of those wealthy people I was talking about  They're
on the lower end of wealthy but wealthy they are

   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes  If you're
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes

Yah I think the draft for Vietnam was a sack of shit  But do we get
to pick and choose which laws we obey Mr Chaudhary  If so shall we
set up a you follow the laws you like and I'll follow the laws I 
like arrangement

Tell me why do you think health care is a human right

Sorry to grease the hill on ya there

   Make love not War

Be sure and wrap that wanker when you go spreadin' that free love stuff
around  Or after the FDA gets its thumb out of its ass use that neat

   Contrary to popular belief it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse  Women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills  I look forward to it

So do I  Amen  And all that

mucho deleteo before and after 
   lots deleted here as well

Anyone who supports the legality of abortion but objects to it being
covered by a universal health care program that covers nearly everything
else as well is contradicting themselves  

  Actually I believe anyone that supports the legality of abortion but
  supports it being covered by a universal health care program is
  contradicting themselves  I am prochoice but I am also antigovernment
  fundingforabortion  Why  

  Example  if a prolifer writes on the net that abortion should be illegal
  heshe is immediately flamed with you have no right to impose your morals
  on everyone  If you don't support abortion don't have one but don't take
  the choice away from everyone  By supporting government funding I feel I
  would be saying If you don't support abortions tough because you are 
  paying for them anyway  To me this no longer makes it a mutually exclusive
  choice issue which invalidates a main argument of many prochoicers I
  would be forcing my morals on prolifers  In this respect I feel the 
  hypocrisy of supporting government funding and being pro'choice' greatly 
  outweighs any hypocrisy of not supporting government funding and being 
  prochoice

Ok one last time  yeah right  In order for you to not pay for any
abortions through your tax money everyone would have to not pay for
any abortions through tax money  If this is the case then women who
have reasons for needing an abortion but are unable to afford it on
their own are just out of luck  Their choice is blocked because of
econonmic hardshipwhich is part of why they might need the abortion
in the first placeand because some people don't want to pay for any
abortions  On top of that there is the assumed requirement that the
governemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it
which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion
This involves more money

Suppose instead there is government funding of abortions for women who
desire them but can not afford one on their own  Those who do not want
an abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered if they can
not afford it on their own and those who do want an abortion will be
able to get one and save the government money in the process  How then
are you paying for an abortion  Rather that abortion is paid for by
the cost of delivery that it saves and then some and all because
we remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure
Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery which is often used
as an example of elective surgery that is not generally paid for just
because it is desired and can not be afforded

If you insist on complaining about paying for someone's choice to have
an abortion when they can't afford it I will complain about paying for
the larger costs of restricting that choice when they can not afford it
Why should you pay for someone else's choice  Why should I pay more to
restrict someone's choice

a bunch of other stuff deleted  not related to me  

A prochoice majority would not be enough for one of the two prochoice
candidates to win however a prolife majority should have been enough
for the only prolife candidate to win  I think the fact that he didn't
says something about the number of prolife people in the country

  No it says something about abortion not being the most important issue to
  many prolifers as well as everyone else  I personally think it is 
  stupid to vote for someone because of their stance on one issue     

A prolifer who does not consider abortion an extreemly important issue
is an oxymoron  If it's not important enough for you to vote the way you
feel because of other issues then why should anyone take your insistance
that abortion is wrong seriously

                                                      People's perception
of the economy and Bush's apparent indifference coupled with a liberal
media were more likely explanations  

It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a clear
unbiased poll on the issues of abortion  In order to be unbiased there would
have to be allowance made for shades of grey rather than lump all of the
middle with one side by tricky wordingsuch as on the last poll I heard
about  Of course then we would know once and for all how the country
really feels about it and then what could we argue about

  other stuff deleted left for Ralph to answer

I still haven't heard of Clinton doing anything that sounded contrary to
my understanding of his position prior to the election nor anything I

Did you vote for him in the first place  You don't have to answer that
if you consider it none of our business

Adrienne Regard


So is that all this is about money   What price do you put
on human life

Make you a deal Adrienne  Suppose we choose the following
figures

value of fetus           
value of abortionist     

If you'll pay me  for every fetus terminated since
Roe v Wade  approx  I'll pay you 
for your martyr Dr Gunn
Deal

I think you are leaving out a great deal of other value  There is no
rational reason to give an abortionist a value  million times that
of a fetus  Why not  billion for instanceoh but then you would
loose on the deal

Instead we should look at what is really involved in each abortion
There is the loss of a human life a life that would otherwise have
eventually become a member of society  That is certainly a nonzero
value  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman who
finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy and the greater suffering
caused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it  That
woman is already a member of society

I argue that the cost of suffering of a real member of society is
far greater than the loss of a potential future member of society

Now as for your deal  Suppose you pay the value of all the suffering
of every woman who was denied an abortion or would have been denied
an abortion under your desired position  And we will pay the value
of all the potential future members of society that never became a part of
it or would not have been a part of it under our desired position

Think about it

Of course I expect you will object to my argument that suffering of
ongoing life is worse than loss of juststarting life  If so please
put forth some rational argument for how the life of a currently
nonsentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being
I figure if I ask enough places and such an arguement exists I should
eventually see it

 First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the

 production back up to capacity would also be a smart move at the moment 
 Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling If they had extra capacity they would
 use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests

I agree with most of what Phill says except the point about it being in
our interests to bring down the oil price  Consider that both the US
and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy 
their energy needs    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany
Japan and many other industrial rivals more than these two  
In addition the proceeds from the sale especially by Saudi Arabia Kuwait
UAE etc are disproportionately reinvested in the US and GB 
propping up these economies and further providing an incentive 
to keep prices from falling too low

  BTW is anyone besides myself peeved that nonUS citizens Puerto
  Ricans etc are very close to having full representation in the US
  House of Representatives
 
 
    Sorry Chris Puerto Ricans are US citizens

OK  I stand corrected  I guess then that the comments about payoffs
ie pork to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still
stands

Now everybody how about some opinion on the following related topic

Should the people who are natives of US territories have
representation in the US House of Rep's or the US Congress
The US Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent
each State in proportion to its population and the Senate to represent
each State equally  What should be done with US territories like
Puerto Rico  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
the past such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest
Territory

    Male sex survey Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
    the  percent figure that has been part of the conventional
    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report

 So what

 It will be interesting to see the reaction when million queers
   gather in Washington DC After all if there are only million of
   us then this is an event unprecidented in history

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 

Don't forget that  had  or more partners

Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  

And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
who said they where homosexual Or is that number to inconvient for
you

It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are

Fuck off

FURY OF MOTHER NATURE

Man's contribution to environmental pollution are paltry compared to those 
of nature In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET former Atomic Energy 
Commision Chairman Dr Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data all 
of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the 
industrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic 
materials aerosols and particulates spewed into the air from just three 
volcanoes Krakatoa in Indonesia in  Mount Katmai in Alaska in  and 
Hekla in Iceland in  To which could be added Mount St Helens in 
Washington State in  which pumped out  metric tons of carbon 
dioxide alone El Chicon in Mexico in  which sent more than  million 
tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere and Mount Pinatubo in the 
Philippines which in  hurled upwards of  million tons of material into 
the stratosphere
LOS NINOS
Many environmentalists attributed the  drought in the US to global 
warming but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a 
natural phenomenon the interaction of El Nino and El Nina two massive 
currents in the tropical Pacific El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that 
periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's 
weather patterns Now and then it alternates with El Nina a mass of cold 
water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for 
thousands of miles
CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon Cold water along 
the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii The 
result was both the US drought and the devastating floods that swamped 
Bangladesh Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and 
distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America Then the Jet 
Stream shoved rainproducing weather systems away from the interior of the 
US resulting in drought
TERMITE TERROR

Sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental 
degradation TIME for April  noted that in the Netherlands manure 
from pigs poses a major ecological threat defiling water supplies with 
excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils Sheep have permanently scarred 
the landscape in Spain and Portugal while in India  bovines cows are 
ravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage 
standing forrests
The February  issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that an international 
team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the 
Carbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does According to a study reported in 
SCIENCE for November   the estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide 
produced by termites was more than twice the net global input from fossil 
fuel combustion In addition Termites are a potentially important source 
of atmospheric methane they could account for a large fraction of global 
emmisions The woodeating pests have a bacteria that enables them too 
digest carbon so efficiently that some  pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide 
methane and other gases they belch into the atmosphere
Ants are another natural source of pollution In  an atmospheric 
chemist with Bell Laboratories and zoologists from Cornell University 
reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities 
of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in 
remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the 
globe It is abundant for instance in the fog and mists that hang over the 
rain forests of Central Africa According to the July   INSIGHT 
magazine the ants release the acid when defending themselves and 
communicating with each other and upon dying Since   percent of the world 
ant population belongs to this subfamily there is significant concern about  
the acid the ants release an amount estimated at  metric tons 
annually which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of 
automobiles refuse combustion and vegetation
Clearly man has a long way to go to match nature as a despoiler of the 
environment

The following statement was released
on February  by the Science 
Environmental Policy Project

As independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems we are 
concerned by the agenda for UNCED the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development being developed by environmental and  activists 
groups and certain political leaders This so called Earth Summit is 
scheduled to convene in  Brazil in June  and aims to impose a system of 
global envionmental regulations including onerous taxes on energy fuels on 
the population of the United States and other industrialized nations
Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories They 
are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming 
follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action We 
do not agree 
A survey of US Atmospheric scientists conducted in the summer of  
confirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming 
observed during the past century A recently published research paper even 
suggests sunspot variability which is directly proportional to solar 
activity  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the 
global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 
Futhermore the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that 
the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming 
cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record 
Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models
Finally agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide 
levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on 
world food supply
We are disturbed that activists anxious to stop energy and economic growth 
are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent 
changes in the underlying science We fear that the rush to impose global 
regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy on jobs 
standards of living and health care with the most severe consequences 
falling on developing countries and the  poor

Lots of good points re Mormons in the US

The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms At
least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the
US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance

I don't think that my lot were particularly mainstream in those days either
Mind you like the Budhists I somehow doubt the Quakers would ever form a
militant religious fanatic movement


  Or laws to stop companies from making lookalike FordGM car parts and
selling them as the real thing  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 's cars

Wooa there I have a classic car If I buy a body pannel for  after
being told that it is genuine BL and discover that it is a non original
copy value  I get real pissed If I can get the genuine article I will
pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit probably
meaning that its cheaper overall but it also means that the car is worth
a hell of a lot more Even on a twenty year old car there is a big
difference in a baddly restored car where much of the work needs to be
redone and a concours classic I got mine for  quid because it was
in a shitty state from bad repairs If it had been well repaired it would
be worth a hell of a lot more

Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for
infringing copyright on parts they don't make I find that very hard to
beleive In the UK they are very sympathetic  Ford recently dug out
the Cortina Mk I body press so that some company could make a few more
BL does amazing stuff they kept the entire assembly line for the MGs
and helped set up a company to remanufacture new bodyshells

There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off
The former I can't see anyone trying to stop Most car cos see classic
vehicles as a damn good ad for them The latter though is fraud If a
part is described to me as real GM and money taken under that assurance
when they know it ain't GM that's fraud


  It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in
everything for them who are really dangerous

It really is odd I post saying that the US govt does appauling things
under Regan Bush etc in foreign policy The right get really pissed 
Then when I point out that nobody seems to have posted a better suggestion
as to how to solve the WACO affair they come with the govt paranoia
bit It's like they reserve their ability to criticise the govt for 
when they feel their interests are threatened but don't give a cuss about
anyone else

You should revers that attitude When your interests are threatened its
way too late You have to challenge the govt when it is attacking
someone else's interests 

That does not mean however that you can start calling the govt the 
equivalent of the NAZI party on the basis of an unfortunate outcome
in a hostage situation

 Any thoughts on who is going to count all of the gorgeous bodies at 
 the MOW  The press  The White House Staff  The most Junior 
 Senator  The King of the motssbi  

 Just curious as to whose bias we are going to see when the numbers 
 get brought out

Probably law enforcement people Park Service Police and DC cops
who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the
density of the crowd in small regions

These sort of techniques derive from Army Intelligence and CIA
methods of estimating troop strength and tend to be
methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers
so as to justify bigger budgets

Judging from past experience the ' March a Peace and Justice March the 
same year and  different Procoice Marches The Park Service will come out
with an estimate that is approximately  the estimate that organizers will
come up with  though the last Choice march I went to had a signin system 
and the numbers ended up closer  And then you've got the media types in their
helicopters rolling dice

I believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy and 
basing their count on those  I see two problems with this  One can they 
get everybody to take one and only one  Two they couldn't possibly have
been able to choose a colordesign that won't clash with somebody's outfit

   So what
 
 Homosexuals lie about the  number to hide the disproportionate
 involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  They also lie
 about  to keep politicians scared
 

Back your statments with proof or shut up

   It will be interesting to see the reaction when million queers
     gather in Washington DC After all if there are only million of
     us then this is an event unprecidented in history
 
 But many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals but
 other members of the leftist agenda
 

Again back your statements or shut up

  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
  The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 
  
  Don't forget that  had  or more partners
 
 Not surprising  Remember that study includes homosexuals as well
 

Hmm  Tell me did you go to the Mickey Mouse school of logic  You have
just stated that there are not many homosexuals as Kinsey reported in his
survey and the surveys of the Kinsey Institute since  Then you say that
the reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form
a large part of that group or there are some homosexuals whose lives 
consist of having sex with no gaps for eating c  Using your logic
it would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about  partners each
a week  Try to think through your arguments carefully  Or then again not
because I like to laugh every now and then

  Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
  and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
  homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
  male population  
  
  And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those

 It wasn't published
 

Hence the argument cannot be resolved using this data  Next point please

  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
  straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
  how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
  
  Fuck off
 
 Typical homoseuxal response
 
 

This depends on the premise that there are only three types of behaviour gay bi
and hetero  This has yet to be proved  See an earlier post about the Kinsey
Institute of grading  This although rough seems more logical  Also you use
this would show defining a fact and not an assumption  Again back your 
statements or shut up

 Yes you are  When you and the rest of the homosexual community
 pass laws to impose your moral codes on me by requiring me to
 hire rent to or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
 my will yes you are in my face  Until homosexuals stop trying
 to impose their morals on me I will be in your face about this

Your post is based on the premise that the laws as they stand do not
discriminate anybody so your argument falls over immediately  Are you
really that dumb as to use emotive language to prove an argument

 When you force people to associate with others against their will
 yes
 
 


Good grief  I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may
be discussed intelligently

I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic
minority  However your argument again falls flat on its face  You state
that you under an antidiscrimination bill would be forced to associate
with others homosexuals I assume against your will  How do you know that
you do not associate with them now except they may be closeted   Would you
like to change your argument to read forced to associate with truthfully
homosexual people against my will  You have no proof that anyone you
now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your
argument  Is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour sic
and that is the camp mincing type  Prove it  You cannot

I must admit though that it looks as if you actually thought about your response
this time instead of just raving

 The Walz monster above however was past  when he molested these
 kids as he says above


Hehehe  Dontcha just love these carefully constructed arguements

Clayton babe please define the word molest  Are you using a legal
term or a proper dictionary term  Molest as far as I can remember means
to do damage to persons  My mate Mike was lured into a woman's parlour
when he was   Is that molestation  A number of my friends straight lost
their virginity before that  Were they 'molested'  They told me that they
thoroughly enjoyed the experience  I see no damage  

Please stop pushing your objective morality on others  If you push people won't
fall over and say 'Ye gads you're right' they'll just push back

Have you signed up for that logic course yet

 Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
 better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

	Firstly they could have backed off  When you put a power freak like
David Koresh in that kind of situation he is going to explode  no pun
intended  Koresh wanted to be a martyr and the government played right into
his hands

	If the government hadn't given him the attention he wanted nothing
would have ever happened

	Secondly the Davidians were expecting everything the government did 
They thought that they were facing the apocalypse and that they were to perish
in fire  They weren't scared of the FBI  They are not the average hoods they
are very devout followers of a religion  PsyOps didn't work and the government
got frustrated so they murdered them 

	The BATF should have left at the beginning they should have looked at
Koresh's personality  Instead they thought They have guns  We have bigger
guns  Let's go get 'em

	They botched it from day one  They shouldn't have been there in the
first place


The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 


If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it

What exactly do you think the Jewish zelots at Masada did They 
poisoned themselves and their families when they were sure there
was on other choice but submission or death Why are you holding
the Branch Davidian to a higher standard than the Jews

Although I can understand why you think the comparison might be valid
I would have to disagree The Jews who found themselves alone against
Rome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the one
faced by the Branch Davidians The latter in reality would likely
have been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes
Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely It is highly
unlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been been
imprisoned for very long But regardless most of the people and
certainly all of the children would have been allowed to leave and if
they so chose join another cult

The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what had
already happened Had they surrendered the men of fighting age would
probably have been put to death perhaps crucified  The women and
children would have been enslaved None of them would have been likely
to practice their religion again

I understand that HowellKoresh and perhaps others will argue that the
fate of the Branch Davidians was equally onerous and that they were
fighting for religious freedom I guest that's a judgement call

You might  except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than

This is getting sad  All you can do is make this ridiculous statements
based upon some old information and a Press Democrat article that was
poorly written

Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

Well they never should have gotten into this situation

Look at the history of this group David Koresh has been arrested
twice  by local police Both times he accepted the arrest warrant
and went peacefully So the feds decide to arrest him How do they
choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under
arrest They throw a concussion grenades at his building 

In addition we KNOW that we've been lied to Initially we were told
that they suspected him of molesting children and having several
wives But these are NOT ATF offenses were they So they changed
their story several times And the original warrant is STILL sealed
And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had but did
anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire They claimed that Koresh
hadn't left the compound in months but people in town report seeing
him just a week before the raid

How would I have handled it differently 

Well first I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything
wrong There's a sealed warrant and a collection of stories which
keep changing about what they did So I might not have done ANYTHING

OK Now supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for
Well they've got a history of accepting arrests so I send
officers to the door with a warrant Wearing bulletproof vests
Covered from a distance by sharpshooters Now there's no good reason
to suspect that these people will do anything right Why didn't
anyone TRY serving a warrant

OK Going further They refuse the warrant It becomes necessary to
raid You plan a raid You hear an hour before that there was a leak
and they know your coming SO what do you do  Well change your
plans right Nope they go ahead with it anyone including
sending in unprotected men to break into the place It was idiotic I
don't know what I would have ended up doing But that original raid
should NEVER have happened

The shit that came later should NEVER have happened

The full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us
know what the hell really happened there

The lies should NEVER have been told

When you force people to associate with others against their will
yes


You are forced everyday to associate with people that you do not
wish to and there isn't even a law that makes you do it  But 
you do becuase you want to go shopping or go to work or go to
a public park or go to a baseball game etc

The process of ending discrimination is based upon the rational
concept 'that all men women people are created equal' have
the same equal standing and chances in society

Greetings
    Specious reasoning alert  Sorry folks I don't like gun control
too much but this is just too crazy

      The main gun control law is similar to or even BASED ON a
German gun control law

      Germany was Controlled With Evil Nazi's at the time

      Nazi's are bad

    Therefore gun control is bad  If this seems reasonable to you
try reading it as GunControlIsANaziPlot  That's pretty much what it's
saying

    Look let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense not by
trying to appeal to emotions and threatening conspiracies  Denounce
GCA ' as wrong because it's WRONG not because it's based off of a
law from someone else's government

    As for the 'Lots Of Brave Men Died Fighting Nazi's So Their Laws
Have No Place On Our Books'  Well lots of brave men died fighting
England  Wanna bet we've got lots of English laws on our books  Oh
but they're our ALLIES now so everything's hunkydory  I'm VERY
sure that the GCA is not the only law that we have on the books which
is similar or even based on a law on the german books  HOWEVER
that does not give invalidation in and of itself

    WE THE PEOPLE must state that we find the law unappealing and
contrary to our freedom  We must use logic and reason and compelling
arguments  To use emotion and appeal to fear is to lower yourselves
to the level of your enemies

    A side issue  When talking about the Amendments it bothers
me to see people acting as if they empower them but require no
responsibility from them  Free speech also assumes restraint well
armed militia expects well TRAINED militia the right to vote expects
the citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonable
decision  You are not granted these rights without any responsibility
to the society that offers them  You have a responsibility in return
and it's to do more than bitch

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 

Wait a second you're ignoring major facts here

There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant The BATF had a
noknock warrant The initial firefight began when the BATF threw
concussion grenades at the building BATF admits this

If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it

Let's be realistic here shall we

You're a member of a rather paranoid religious organization Someone
comes to your building dressed in black suits carrying firearms
They throw a concussion grenade at the place and try to break in
What exactly are you going to do

I would not allow anyone to enter my home without first identifying
themselves If someone attacks my home by firing weapons or throwing
explosive I think I'd be entirely justified in defending myself

Regardless of what I think of the BDs and regardless of whether or
not they were guilty of firearms violations this is NOT the way you
treat people in a supposedly free society

 Not surprising  Remember that study includes homosexuals as well

Implying no so tacitly that homosexual men are more promiscuous than
heterosexual men  Interesting especially in the wake of a news report
last week about a group of high school seniors heterosexual I might
add who boasted monthly conquests of up to  girls each  It
seems that promiscuity is not limited to homosexuals

This is a sad fact of life no matter what you look for  whether it 
be homosexual promiscuity racial discrimination or sexual harassment
 you will find it  Whether or not it actually exists where you're

 The median of a distribution is that variatevalue which divides the
 distribution halfway ie  of the distribution population have
 lower and half have higher variatevalues

 So for Males  the median this means that half of these men
 are higher than this and half are lower than this  Now if the population
 sample size is  and  of them are gay  males are gay  If we
 say they are distributed equally then only  are greater than 
 sexual partners of course this means that  heterosexual men are
 greater than 

Not quite  First the median does not imply that half of the men are
above and half below  it simply means that  is the midpoint
between the maximum number of partners and the minimum which is most
likely zero  However assuming your implication to be moreorless
correct your final result is still invalid  If  of all males
have had more than  partners and you deduct the assumed  of 
homosexual males what remains is not  but still  of all
heterosexual males  Which is to say hey we're all human

How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives on

took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

I'm curious why you think that particular adjective is important

       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr King  From many
of the newspaper radio and tv news reports I have seen this adjective

is commonly in front of his name  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner  I did not say that
Mr King was a no good black  I do not know Mr King and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect  I used it PURELY as a
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many  most  news people have
used it in the past

No one is questioning whether Mr King is black  The question arises
whether King's race should make police officers afraid as hell  Your
statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for
large black guys than for just large guys in general

The original poster never said they were afraid of King because he was
black  In fact the officers were afraid of King because of WHAT HE DID
not because OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN  It is you Mr Frank that read the
phrase large black man and cried racism in a typical kneejerk fashion
When you and others I suspect can get past this problem maybe the real
problems in this issue can be discussed

That two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use
of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use

      The entire second trial was about race Ted  I don't feel compelled to
discuss Mr King's racial background but had Mr King been white there would
not have been a second trial  You probably are saying that the beating would
not have occurred if he were white but that is an extremely difficult call
to make  It is possible the case but not definately

One could easily point out that the jury decided that this extremely
difficult call could be made which is why the two of the defendants
were found guilty  One could also make some interesting observations on
our system of justice where the men were not guilty of excessive force
but guilty enough to have violated his civil rights by use of the
nonexistant excessive force


It is also interesting to note that Powell and maybe Koons were found
guilty of aiding and abetting the deprival of King's civil rightsbut
two others who also beat King and all the others who watched were not

 So what can we deduce from these figures  Are there a lot
 less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men
 perhaps women too not as honest as they used to be about
 there sexuality  Presumably the people that were polled in

You mean in the s men and women were much more open about
their homosexuality than today  Want to try that one again


That probably is not true  But today it may not be much better for
the gay population in general


You mean ignore study after study so that we can continue to 
accept a study Kinsey's that is obviously wrong  


Where are all of these studies  You have cited a few and my research
shows that there are not that many  Do Not Confuse a survey as a
study there is a big difference  Asking people outside of a polling
booth and adding up numbers is NOT a study

 as easily of been gay I suppose  One of the big debates about
 homosexuality is whether or not it's a type of behavior that is
 learned or if one is just born that way  IMHO the more likely
 explanation is that it's some combination of the two

Based on what besides your own warm fuzzy feelings

But this is what you base most of your conclusion upon Warm
fuzzy feelings

Maybe he has stated an educated opinion based upon the studies
that involve genetics and psychological influence  There are a
lot of those types of studies aren't there  Try reading some

 Here's something to ponder upon  have any of you gaybashers out
 there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual
 orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an
 intrinsic and natural part of their life as heterosexuals do
 about their own sexuality  In other words someone who is truly

Alcoholics share that feeling until they hit bottom

This is a crap statement and comparison  Many people use this sad
and stupid argument  There is not relationship between alcoholics
and people's sexual orientation except that some may find what it
really is when they are drunk repressed inhibition released

Unless of course the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder caused by childhood sexual abuse as a number of
recent works suggest

Nonsense this simply is not true  I suppose it is a waste of time
to try and tell you to understand what a study presents  Most of
what you cite does not extrapolate anything you do


If homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
morality on others antidiscrimination laws and leave our children

If people in general would stop using irrational position to oppress
other's and leave our private lives to ourselves I would have no
support for laws and rules to protect people form this  But we need
only look at post such as yours to see that they lack rational
thought and intelligent outlooks

alone I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private  But
until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of 
government is to tell peaceful people how to live I have no choice
but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an alternative
lifestyle but a sickness


Remember that peaceful people are not necessarily doing the right 
thing  Peaceful tolerant enlightened educated rational thinking
people that is what we need

What exactly do you think the Jewish zelots at Masada did They 
poisoned themselves and their families when they were sure there
was on other choice but submission or death Why are you holding
the Branch Davidian to a higher standard than the Jews

The two situations are hardly analogous unless you wish to make the
dubious claim that the US legal system would provide equivalent treatment 
to BD children that the Romans did for those of conquered rebels

Actually all the analogy calls for the the Branch Davidian feeling
their treatment would be along these lines After a military
assualt instead of a peacefull effort to serve a warrant and
weeks os siege such a feeling might not be completely irrational

 Looks like the Branch Davidian is out of buisness
 
 This morning the police FBIBATF started ramming
 holes in the walls of buildings and shooting in tear gas
 Shortly there after a fire began that has now engulfed 
 all the buildings in the compound  Only one Brach Davidian
 member has come out
 
 Authorities are saying that Branch Davidian members were
 seen starting the fire  It looks like there will no
 witnesses to dispute that claim
 
 There were  adults an  children in the compound
 


Funny how the fire seemed to start on the right hand side of the 
building just next to where a tank was backing away though

Probably just a coincidence

Watch the videotape carefully the CNN coverage was fairly decisive

The first fire starts in the Tower this is three storeys high and there
is a flag to the right of it on the picture The second fire starts 
in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high
The flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire
starting

Thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate
locations The FBI report a third I was not able to verify it from the
videotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind
the small tower in the second flag on left camera angle


The flames coming out of the building are yelloworange This is the
normal colour for carbon compounds burning The flames were those of a 
solid or confined liquid burning not of a gas exploding 


The explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an
explosive though The cloud itself is on fire This would seem to
be most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather than
the explosion of a magazine


Funny how considering there was to be a great cache of explosives
ammunition etc in the compound I did not see any series of explosions

Depends entirely on how they were distributed You would not be able
to identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage
from a mile away If and when the FBI release pictures from cmeras
on the armoured vehicles which presumably exist it might be possible to 
get a clearer picture 

If anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka Rambo movies then
remember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs

Just about the most you could expect would be to see the grenades
going off Since the building was designed to be blast proof to some
extent it would be difficult to distinguish the grenades going off from
the collapse of the building due to the fire


And oops the automatic weapons were probably burnt up in the fire
with the other witnesses

Paranoia

Unless I see videotapes showing the davidians starting the fire I
guess I may have a problem believing the feds saying they saw them
doing it but couldnt or didnt manage to tape it  They have
been taping everything else

You wouldn't beleive the FBI if they showed you a picture of Koresh himself
setting light to the place Your mindset is such that you are simply
unable to accept as true anything that might suggest that a group of
heavily armed weapons fanatics might indeed be in the wrong

The gun lobby can't accept that the BD set light to the place because
that would mean that Koreh had murdered  children that would mean that
their taking his account of the murder of  BATF agents would be even
less credible than it was to start with

Koresh had  days to come out with his hands up and face a fair trial 
Instead he ordered the murder of everyone in the place

 One way or another  so much for patience Too bad you couldn't just
 wait Was the prospect of God's Message just too much to take
 
 So you believe that David Koresh really is Jesus Christ
 
         They cut off the water there were no fire trucks present and
 the FBIATF go blasting holes into the builing and firing gas munitions
 The building burns almost everyone dies  It probably doesn't bother
 you much but it bothers many other peoplemost of whom dont believe
 particularly in Koresh or his message
 
         Four ATF agents and  branch Davidians are now dead because of
 crazy tactics on the part of the ATF and FBI
 
         Attorney General Vampira tells us that todays events were suppose
 to save those in the compound  Blowing holes in a building and
 gassing those inside was supposed to save them

My two cents

It is a sad sad day I never thought I'd be defending religious
people especially extremists but I am mourning the murders of
David Koresh and his followers I believe they deserved the right
to life liberty the pursuit of happiness and the right to worship
as they saw fit Those rights and the lives of innocent men women
some pregnant and children were sacrificed to save the Federal
Government from being embarrassed Had the Branch Davidians taken
their case to court the black eye the BATF earned themselves would
have been multiplied many times over

I also mourn the deaths of the BATF agents although the deceptions
carried out against them by our government were nothing compared to
the atrocities against the Branch Davidians

Attorney General Vampira claims to have made the best decision she
could based on the information she was given This is possible Officials
in higher positions than hers have been duped We have no choice so
we may as well give her another chance Even if she is truly evil
it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time

I'm considering joining the NRA

Finally I have one question What happened to the Federal agents that
had supposedly infiltrated the Branch Davidians' organization and
started this whole debacle

The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story This is simply rationalisation It is not enough for 
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent That would require
them to come up with a solution themselves Instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder  people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through

What's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all
sorts of people desperately trying to get a revolution It makes
ambulance chasing by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime

For the last few months benighted souls have been calling CSPAN on issues
as mundane as budget resolutions saying that I don't know I just have
the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country and so on

Get real For a real case study in revolution go to Blockbuster Video
and check out Underground a film made about the Weather Underground in
the 's Even with all the strife back then the revolution never did
come And Waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times

In the tape it is interesting to see the way the Weatherpersons dance
around the issue of one of their defining moments which was when a few
of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in
a Greenwich village townhouse The problem one of them said was that
they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they forgot about
their own personal safety and weren't careful But of course that was
society's fault a society that didn't instill a sense of worth in
the people so they neglect their own safety

Current apologists for Koresh may pick up some important rationalization
tips from this tape

 Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
 better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

	Firstly they could have backed off  When you put a power freak like
David Koresh in that kind of situation he is going to explode  no pun
intended  Koresh wanted to be a martyr and the government played right into
his hands

	If the government hadn't given him the attention he wanted nothing
would have ever happened

	Secondly the Davidians were expecting everything the government did 
They thought that they were facing the apocalypse and that they were to perish
in fire  They weren't scared of the FBI  They are not the average hoods they
are very devout followers of a religion  PsyOps didn't work and the government
got frustrated so they murdered them 

	The BATF should have left at the beginning they should have looked at
Koresh's personality  Instead they thought They have guns  We have bigger
guns  Let's go get 'em

	They botched it from day one  They shouldn't have been there in the
first place
 
 
The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush


 The above statement ignores reality The BD WERE provoked


 
Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell


 Damn Phil You must have seen a different tape of the initial raid than
I did Your doorbell' happened to include lobbing percussion grenades and
attempting to storm the compound through the windows I can honestly say
I have never seen a doorbell' that works like that



 
The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one


  THINK man The BATF are serving a warrant on someone who they feel might
 have illegal automatic weapons If they expected as you state that the BD
 to be anything other than peaceful citizens' they could have sent one maybe 
 two agents up to the front door knock and attempt to serve the warrant on
 the person answering the door Scenario one that person lets them in to 
 perform the search and no one gets hurt Scenario two the person answering
 the door pulls a weapon aand kills both officers Now you have two dead BATF
 agents instead of four the BATF knows exactly where they stand with regards
 to the BD and began to formulate a plan of action to arrest those responsible
 without harm to the innocent peoplechildren within the compound


 
The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 


 No the stupidity was the attempt to serve the warrant SWAT style


 
 
If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it


 Sure do it within the law The BATF is there to uphold the law not
 circumvent it to fit their needs

Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

For starters they could have gone on waiting and negotiating  The Davidians
weren't going anywhere and their supplies had to be limited  Large perhaps
but limited  If they had simply fired the compound by themselves without
gov't tanks smashing down their walls then at least the gov't would not be
guilty of having again used an inappropriate level of force and would have
been able to use the meantime to continue to pressure and negotiate  No they
would not have looked good on the news in six months or a year  But they sure
as hell don't look very good now

That has not been demonstrated  Had he come to trial there was a very real
possibility that Koresh would have gotten an acquittal on grounds of self
defense  All survivors of the debacle have sworn that the BATF shot first

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

They rang the doorbell using a concussion grenade  And if the bloody
warrants were legal then why were they sealed after the fight started
And if Koresh had declared himself a private state and was just daring the
gov't to go in then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who
served a warrant forhisarrest as opposed to the BATF search warrant
which did not include arrest unless violations were found by just calling
him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car
That doesn't sound like a dictator to me it sounds like someone who knows
he has a court battle  Things might have gone very differently if the BATF
had rung the doorbell

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

This is stupid  That is no paranoid assertion it is testamony from surviving
witnesses and the BATF has no tanks nor am I aware of either the BATF or
the FBI using any until yesterday  When they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed

The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 

Underarmed  You flabberghast me they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bulletproof vests  They were using concussion
grenades and fullauto weapons what was missing lowyield tacnukes  This
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used both initially and yesterday  You should be ashamed

If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it

They had a surefire method keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looneytune religious
stunt

Phil I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you
will back anything no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone
else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like  It's people
with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust a process
that is in place now in this country even if the tattered pitiful remains
of the Constitution is slowing its progress  This isn't a Libertarian issue
others may argue that line but from a strictly Constitutional view of a
democratic gov't what the FBI and BATF did was wrong wrong wrong even if
their reasons for trying to arrest Koresh were  right  Anything that
leads to the deaths of  children if nothing else touches your stoney
heart is wrong no matter who pushed the button  For God's sake man get
your morality back

It's my understanding that Koresh didn't want to come
out alive rather to fulfill his own interpretations
of some prophecies

More interesting was discussions on the news about subterannean
tunnels under the complex  Wonder if he was planning on hiding
out a few days then reemerging resurrected  Sounds a bit
like the book Passover Plot to me  Hmmmmm

  Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals  Just because 
  someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do  Look at the world  
  Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero
 
 Hmmm what statistics are these Can you offer any references The only
 studies I've seen indicate a higher proportion of homosexuals in prison
 than in the general population but I don't think that allows for the
 default you refer to Prison is not a normal situation
 
 But I haven't seen anything that suggests that the default proportion is
 lower than in the general population although it seems plausible
 
 Anyway as I say can you provide any references
 
 

Is this an arguement against or for  Or simply a statement of agreeance
disagreeance  The fact that there are more homosexuals in prison does not
mean that homosexuals are immoral and more liable to commit crime  And one
must remember that prison is not necessarily a reflection of the type of
people who are criminals  What are the statistics for unsolved crime

So we try to ensure that the process of deciding whether to introduce
third parties isn't random  As Steve said above there are examples
where third parties are less ignorant or corrupt than the two
primary parties should this knowledge not be able to help

Of course it helps  but only if the decision to involve third parties
is the primary partis' to make  A corrupt and ignorant third party
isn't going to say  we're corrupt and ignorant  we'll stay out of this
Pointing out that they are corrupt and ignorant won't help  they either
won't believe you or won't care


 
  It's impossible or at least beyond my abilities to formulate a rule
that will always tell whether the involvement of a third party would be
good or bad  but there's one that seems better than any other I've ever
heard suggested  voluntary good  mandatory bad  That is  a third
party should involve itself in a transaction ONLY at the request of
the primary participants
 
So we don't formulate a rule that will always tell we try to use
knowledge about other properties of situations  To some of us it
appears that trying always to apply voluntary good mandatory bad
is not only less than optimal it is in some circumstances seriously
damaging  The interesting question is to characterize those
circumstances as best we can

Look  somebody has to have the power to decide whether a third party
will regulate your transactions or not  That somebody is going to
be either you or the third party  You can argue until you are
blue in the face that regulators shouldn't get involved in fact  people
have tried this  they won't listen    The fundamental question you
have to ask is  whose decision is it whether or not to involve regulators
ours or theirs  After you've answered thed first question  you can
try to move on to such questions as should regulators be involved and  if
so  what regulations are appropriate  Although with your answer to
the first question  the second and third are taken out of your hands

So nice of you all to answer some questions  And it so nice that most
of you feel that it would be in your hearts to give the Palestinians
some land  most of you focus on the fact that Israel annexed all
this land and it is a kind gesture to give some of it back  Well
I hope that after after a state run by Palestinians is established
the first decision should be to make Jerusalem part of this state 
by annexing it of course

They Refuse To Learn From History Or From the Present

Pointing to Canada's vaunted socialized medical care program he
contends that it is failing even while the cost is catching up with
angry taxpayers He notes Americans don't go to Canada and
elsewhere for medical care it's the Canadians and others who come
here Why should the United States duplicate what doesn't work well
in other countries We have the world's best medical care let's not
mess it up with Hillary Clinton's plans for socialized medicine


John F McManus National President of the John Birch Society



When McManus says We have the world's best medical care I can hardly
believe he's referring to a system

  That costs us  percent of our GDP while there isn't a
    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than
     percent

  That leaves  million of us with no coverage even though all
    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone

  Yet Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life
    expectancy childhood immunization rate infant mortality and many
    preventable diseases

  We pay on average about  each for MRIs  To put that in
    perspective they cost  in Japan

  The average US company spends over  dollars a year per employee on
    health benefits  Seven hundred to  is the range just about everywhere
    else


How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world  The only
thing the USA health care system is good at is showering wellinsured patients
with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it  And
the private system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient
that it itself sucks up over  billion dollars a year in money from every
other sector of society  individuals government and industry

Of the   billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health
care costs last year the Consumer's Union estimated that at least  billion
was thrown away on overpriced useless and even downright harmful tests and
procedures and the most bureaucratic regulated insurance system in the world

There are more than  different private insurers in the USA  But did the
private competition stimulate more efficient paperwork  Ask any doctor
who's had to hire a fulltime clerk to deal with it all

The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP not down  The
competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the
hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment  Spending millions on
expensive machines of dubious value that spend  percent of the day idle
isn't my idea of the world's best health care system

Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and
expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful  I'm especially
thinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and
Cesarean section  Sound like the world's best health care system



Ever notice how every time someone tries to bring about some real change in
health care the Libbies start bashing Canada's system  First of all Hillary
Clinton is not advocating another Canadian system  I think that's been made
abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months  Where did John F
McManus get that idea anyway

Let's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border  Your
child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals  The
nearest Canadian cities are  hours west and  hours east and there's an
American city one hour south  Which way are you going to go  Is it because
the American system is the best in the world or just for convenience

It still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and
white on health care reform  There are a million different ways we ould
restructure the system  It's not just a choice between total government
control and total private control  I wish the people screaming socialized
medicine every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM
THEMSELVES on health care issues



The current system sucks  I want to keep providers private but that doesn't
change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we
don't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM  Purely private health care without any
government intervention doesn't work  Hillary Clinton is not thinking of
nationalizing providers or evern insurers  How can you scream socialized
medicine at her programs  Don't you even know what you're talking about



Ever see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the
decade  Notice how the line falls then starts increasing  Why  I'll give
you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we
don't do something about it



PEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT  The current health care system is a cancer which is
killing our economic wellbeing  Costs are still rising  percent a year
even as Americans by the tens of millions go without or are forced into
managedcare programs which are certainly pretty socialized already if you
ask me

A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillarybashers to please
come forward and present no gimmicks straight talk just how THEY would set
about keeping costs down  I didn't get a single answer

The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases
filled with evasive platitudes like give health care back to the people
Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms  What is it about the
current system that you would change and how would that help


How can anyone read the news live under our system and NOT see these faults
How can we deal with the deficit our cities our educational system our
infrastrucure AIDS modernizing our industry etc if we don't quit throwing
away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems


America needs health care reform NOW  Don't just sit there and Hillarybash
inform yourself

 In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive
 the words of a man who has just murdered  children and ordered the 
 suicidemurder of his other  followers According to the account given
 the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met
 by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them The Koreshgun supporter
 claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up If the 
 AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
 grade weaponry than standard issue handguns For all practical purposes
 they were unarmed the BD followers had automatic weapons
 

 The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
 government story This is simply rationalisation It is not enough for 
 them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent That would require
 them to come up with a solution themselves Instead they have to come
 up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
 set out to murder  people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
 to get gun control legislation through
 

I must object to the characterization of those opposed to the
government's handling of the Waco situation as gun supporters
Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as rightwing
gun nuts and just mixes up two issues

I am one of the BATFFBI critics and yet I am a liberal
and just as antigun as you are  I just happen to believe
that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies
They're all human beings not some nest of wasps that
you're trying to exterminate

The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled
the original raid  It was well known that Koresh regularly
went jogging outside his property  He could have been served
with a search warrant then  He could have been arrested if
he had refused to comply  Instead officers armed with grenades
invaded the property  This escalated into a shooting war
with tragic deaths on both sides

Those were the first two mistakes  the bad judgment of
asking for a noknock warrant and the bad and probably
illegal way the alreadyunwise warrant was served

At this point the situation escalated to where it was
described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis
That's when the government started covering their traces
sealing the warrant revising their reported history of
the incident etc

Things were already building up to disaster  Now the
government could have simply closed the supply routes
and waited  But according to Janet Reno that option
had never been seriously considered  So supposedly
because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and
because there supposedly were no backups they felt
they had to go in

Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible
for the fire  If that's so he deserves the blame
for the deaths of the people in his compound

But the government's hands are far from clean
Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus
contempt for the th amendment  The motivations
for the second raid are just too unbelievable
And their coverup of the events of the first
raid undermines their credibility in anything
they do thereafter  We have only some very
biased FBI agents' word for what happened

And please let's not turn this into a progun vs antigun
discussion  Antigun people do not believe that gunowners
deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government
agents  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his
guns were legal illegal illegalbutshouldhavebeenlegal
or whatever

They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

    Nontoxic tear gas  Do you know what tear gas is

	But Janet Reno says it was safe and nondebilitating nontoxic
tear gas  She is our Attorney General and she would not tell us 
this if it were not true

    I do once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
    a teargas grenade in that was supposed to be a joke  The sensation 
    was incredible I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart
    I remember us  a bunch of young men in our early 's  running out
    like a herd of wild animals knocking down the door and jumping
    out of the windows thank Gd we were on the first floor

    I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children

	I really cant imagine anyone having the nerve to tell the 
public that the plan was that the gas was going to make all
the mothers pick up their children and run out of the building
And yet this is exactly the story they were out pitching yesterday

Basically I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that
something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to
deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african
americans and that this is about  of the problem

There is something terribly wrong however with a culture which
condemns attacks and all too often kills any of its members who
attempt to get an education  My mother is an elementary school
teacher and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
hisher peers of trying to be white and is beaten bullied and
tormented by them  It goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
a beating  In my mother's school one of the most promising young
students who happened to be african american had her throat cut by
one of these young thugs

Nobody who buys into such a culture has any hope of being anything but
poor andor a thug andor dead regardless of their color

What has to be changed is the culture  If that culture can't be
changed then those africanamerican kids who are willing to separate
from it must be separated from it and the murderous thugs of whatever
color  Otherwise future bright young african american girls who
wanted to be doctors will end up dead on the school bus

 until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of

Oh you definitely have a choice  You realize of course that you

you planning on celebrating two years of lies

Incidentally we are still waiting your crusade against AfricanAmericans
women and other minorities who also want to impose their morality on
others  After all they also want the government to tell peaceful

continue to point out that being a woman or an AfricanAmerican is not

In article Aprvmsocomokstateedu chorleyvmsocomokstateedu writes
   I note with insufficient emotion that amongst the five survivors of the 
   Waco debacle there were two Brits and an Aussie The AngloSaxon persona 
   really doesn't lend itself to martyrdom for a spurious messiah

I don't see how you draw that conclusion  Around  of the  inside the
buildings were British one quarter  Two out of the eight latest count I
heard survivors were British one quarter  Anyhow British doesn't equate
to  AngloSaxon

What exactly are you trying to say  And why were there no fireengines within
a mile of the compound

Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with mm amunition that
has a range of  meters

Next question


The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters
to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place

The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to
attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention If the FBI had
had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type
raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults
It really was a no win situation Koresh had plenty of opportunity 
to give up and stand trial for the murder of the  ATF officers Instead
he ordered the murder of the children


In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive
the words of a man who has just murdered  children and ordered the 
suicidemurder of his other  followers According to the account given
the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met
by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them The Koreshgun supporter
claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up If the 
AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
grade weaponry than standard issue handguns For all practical purposes
they were unarmed the BD followers had automatic weapons


The BD seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely The BD were
quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any
time A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have
achieved that objective that would have been very risky orders of 
magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige Airplanes
and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch 
apocalypse was  terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties
than 

Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either besides the serious
risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the 
question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over
a prolonged period The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared
Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege Rather than go
in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon


Can you think of a better way of getting the children out

A  certain way


The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story This is simply rationalisation It is not enough for 
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent That would require
them to come up with a solution themselves Instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder  people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through

This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got  of its
agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the
middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters

Still the conspiracy theory is comforting it allows them to pretend that
WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in 
resolving a hostage crisis No govt in the world has ever faced a 
comparable situation quite probably there was no manner in which it
could be peacefully resolved The blame does not rest on the FBI it
rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far in particular
the person who tipped the BD off in advance has the murder of  ATF
agents and  children on his or her conscience


There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society
preach salvation through armed security The fact is that these are the
very people who pose the threat to society in the first place The next WACO
may not be religious nutters but a political movement A splinter group
of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example
and holding several hundred children hostage

The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent
them arising No other government in the world has faced such a situation 
this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power
weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah
to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire

The two situations are hardly analogous unless you wish to make the
dubious claim that the US legal system would provide equivalent treatment 
to BD children that the Romans did for those of conquered rebels

	I dont know  The usual practice would be for the government
to confiscate the children and put them into the system  After they
are deprogrammed of course

	The government is capable of incredible evils in the name of
Child protection  Much of the time Child protection concerns
itself with protecting the child from its natural parents  Once its
in the system the government's concern for the child tends to 
go to zero 

	It may not be as bad as Roman behavior but it could hardly
be described as kindlyunless your a believer in the intrinsic
goodness of the government

Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months


After the seige began

Surround the place with Razor wire and then let them sit  Do not
have daily press conferences do your best to keep things out of
the press


As things get more and more miserable inside one of two things is
going to happen

	 People will start coming out

	 They will commit suicide in mass at some point


The thing to remember about  is that hysterical situations and assults
play into the hands of a leader who has picked this course   Its
much easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there
is gas coming in and bullets in the air  Let them be hungry and miserable
for longer and longer and it will probably be more effective

	The possiblity that they would all kill themselves at some
point would not bother me in the least or alter tactics  If people
are going to take their own lives the best you can probably do is
prevent yourself from giving them the opportunity or an excuse to
do it

	If the FBI and Attorney General Vampira really were concerned
with sanitation and welfare of the children inside they would not
have turned the water to the compound off as a pressure tactic in
the first place

Is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in Japan  I'm interested
in knowing if Japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs and how they
dealt with it  I've heard undocumented that Japan years ago used heavy
legal penalties to end a serious heroin problem  I'd like to know both
sides of the story  Does anyone recall such a problem  What were laws
at the time relating to drug use drug dealing and drug trafficking  What
are the laws now  What other antidrug measures like education and treatment
has Japan used  How are drugs regarded by the Japanese people  How effective
have antidrug measures been in Japan  Thanks for your help

PEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT  The current health care system is a cancer which is
killing our economic wellbeing  Costs are still rising  percent a year
even as Americans by the tens of millions go without or are forced into
managedcare programs which are certainly pretty socialized already if you
ask me

A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillarybashers to please
come forward and present no gimmicks straight talk just how THEY would set
about keeping costs down  I didn't get a single answer

    The first thing I would do would be to disband Medicare and Medicade  They
are a primary reason why health care costs are going up  To cover the people
that are currently on these programs I would sell their coverage in blocks
to insurance companies  The private companies would bid to get these large
blocks of people and prices would go down

    To get away from strong federal control on health care I would pass off
more control to the states  Everyone is always spewing forth about how 
wonderful Hawaii is doing  Well how about giving some other STATES incentive
to try their own plans

    What I would NOT do is try to implement some far reaching federal program
program to cover all Americans because this is the surest way to fail


How can anyone read the news live under our system and NOT see these faults
How can we deal with the deficit our cities our educational system our
infrastrucure AIDS modernizing our industry etc if we don't quit throwing
away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems

   One sure way to stop throwing money away is to stop giving so much to the
federal government  Our FEDERAL taxes should be slashed and our STATE taxes
increased  A strong central government always fails  Give power back to the
statescountiescities where it belongs

America needs health care reform NOW  Don't just sit there and Hillarybash
inform yourself

  The more I inform myself the more I want to Hillarybash

Okay but do doctors willingly testify against each other in 
malpractice cases when they do go to court obviously absolutely 
essential to prove malpractice It used to be impossible to get
doctors here to do that A possible advantage of the US system 
you won't hear about from the AMA 

Our doctors' monopoly is exactly the same as in the US if not
more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates
but I don't know an answer to this one  Anecdotally my friends
who are MD's including my main buds from high school talk about
how hard it is to turn state's witness against someone else 
no direct experience there though

Also in some circumstances you may have to sue the insurance plan
people here after all sue health insurance companies all the time 
I heard about a guy in Alberta who came down with some rare eye 
disease that he had to take repeated trips to Seattle to get treated
It cost him and his family something like  and the province 
years later still has only reimbursed them for  or so

Well what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses

Since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable one can
raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which
one is entitled hey not Alberta's fault that he lives there  
If he lived in Cheyenne WY his private insurance would've told him
to go to hell for the travel expenses and that's that  An HMO would
have just kept quiet and let him go blind

Well yeah tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre
outside Ottawa
 
It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital  since
not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff
that others don't  Ottawa's population is only a quarter million
if you include the surrounding counties

My point was that something that should necessarily remain 
unpoliticized has become very politicized to the detriment 
of its mission

I don't think that this has been shown with the DMC 

The problem is in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are
approved by the government how do you keep political considerations
out of medical decisions  I bet that if you're an MP or MPP or good
friends with one you're put on any hospital's urgent care list no
matter how minor your problem Which is OK unless you're someone who
gets bumped off the list for some bigshot
 
People of influence will get their way in any system American or
European  It's the Golden Rule  he who has the gold makes the
rules 

But to what extent does it affect the system And why is an urgent 
care list necessary in the first place It's worth thinking about

It's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get
at what facilities  Don't Americans have to arrange in advance for
operations too  I think that there are two standards being applied
here and that Canada can't give Beverly Hillsstyle treatment to
everybody  It's not a big brother list  it's more like calling
around town for a table for dinner 

Yeah but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow 
especially in the hospital business 

Yes and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that rather
than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the 
next time around  Whether it's using mop a couple of weeks longer
or even selling services to Americans remember our system is cash
based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except
in specialties that require larger populations to generate business
why not  The alternative is closing unused wards  business

whether Canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own 
health services catering toward Americans who would be willing 
to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be 
noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants 
from the province were getting smaller If those grants are so 
insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the 
difference

You answered the question yourself  private nonprofit foundations
have to make money somehow and I think that it's about time that
they acted like the private hospitals that they are  Personally
I'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that
their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance
that's one at you Bob Rae

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield 
the  figure for the US

But don't the US figures include dentistry and optometry where the 
Canadian one until recently anyway didn't

Since we have always been evaluated in an OECD style I don't see
how  remember OECD counts both private and public funds and
in Canada like France and Germany  of health care spending is
private funds ie not the basic health insurance money

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse
 
How  They are collecting premiums  and I'm an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system 

Well if you spend more than you take in you go bankrupt It's that
simple If the provincial insurance systems find themselves paying
out more than they get in revenue they won't be able to pay for
everybody's primary care Yes the infrastructure will be there 
But will everybody be able to continue using it at the same rate

Minor copayments can flush out abusers  Remember that our system
is only an insurance policy  But our costs aren't rising fast
enough to ensure adequate copaymentsdeductibles  last year
Quebec's userfee proposal came out with the number of  as
the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather
than give the QMA a raise  And it's not contract time yet as
far as I can tell from UPI Clarinet 

Even the new Reform Party a breakoff of traditionalists from the
Conservatives with a mildly libertarian faction holds our public
health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to
be reminded that it's not free the average CanadianEuropean is more
fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these
But no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen  but cutting public
spending all over the place and bringing back the death penalty with
little haste if elected

I know that for Pete's sake I live right on the border I know the
Canadian system isn't socialized medicine unlike Britain's NHS 

Sorry   It's just that I even run into people from Buffalo
and from Michigan who don't know 

The point is that means that if the money runs low in the plan
you're out of luck unless you can afford it yourself

Yeah but there'd be a lot of leadtime and a healthcare crisis that
would preclude it  If provincial governments as bad as some of them
are heck we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the
Conservatives in Saskatchewan  embarassing can be so irresponsible
there is still reallocation  health insurance is so important that
it's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent
insurrection outside of the hockey rink  Right now attempts to get
the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like
codliver oil 

Would the private insurers take up the slack They'd be under no
obligation to Of course they could eventually make money again 
but if what you say is true they'd be loathe to do so and out of
practice in handling such basic services too
 
Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
American companies and their parents provide full insurance down
here  Regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV
to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage  The private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage  They run around patting them
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras 
for those people who deserve it

Yeah but eventually it's going to create a kind of twotiered 
effect that will be noticeable after a while like in Britain 

Most Americans are fearful of a singletier system  

Seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a
twomoretiered system like what the French have  a health policy
prof DG Shea has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having
a population of  is necessary for adequate competition 
and in Canada there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes
with that population or larger

Anyways the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those
in the US and barring any future Chernobyllike crisis sudden
transients in spending are unlikely  In fact the health allocation
is one of the most wellbehaved sectors of spending up north so any
talk of bankruptcy is talkradio fodder far away from the border

If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back the
things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like
luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable

This won't be overnight and something like this would force Canada
to have a system more like the French one  but that's not a bad
thing and the change will be minimal ie add copayments and
frustrate the socialists chanting Hey it's free

 that never seems to occur
 
Advances in freedom have been made in the past  The divine right of
king concept was questioned at one time and may have used the same
argument that it hadn't come about before  But our ancestors had the
courage to throw off the old system that said that one man ruling many
was necessary to have a decent wholesome society  In the s the 
concept of slavery was questioned  Our ancestors had the courage to
question a practice that had existed for thousands of years  Was
the idea that one man owning another necessary to have a decent 
wholesome society  Now libertarians question the necessity of
majoritarianism  Is it necessary that many people rule over many
others to have a decent wholesome society

So nice of you all to answer some questions  And it so nice that most
of you feel that it would be in your hearts to give the Palestinians
some land  most of you focus on the fact that Israel annexed all
this land and it is a kind gesture to give some of it back  Well
I hope that after after a state run by Palestinians is established
the first decision should be to make Jerusalem part of this state 
by annexing it of course

Israel has not annexed any of the West Bank just Jeruselum  Which
will remain part of Israel forever

   This is hilarious  Here we have a selfdescribed libertarian

   not exactly known for respecting individualism   In somewhat
   more detail it should be noted that the whole concept of a

   Leviticus Deuteronomy etc are FULL of thou shalts and thou

     Bzzzzt  THANK you for playing but obviously you are not reading the 
  material as it is presented  According to the report I've got in my 
  hands the Newsweek article which reported that  to  percent of the 
  population is gay used the criteria of No heterosexual contact in the 
  past year  But at the same time the University of Denver study points 
  out quite dramatically that  of all selfidentifying gay men have 
 had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year 

I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual 
contact of any kind in the previous year they are counted as heterosexual
Even if they didn't intend it that way that's how the figures are being used

Wait a second you're ignoring major facts here

There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant The BATF had a

   The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms At
   least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the
   US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance

Sigh see what our school systems are producing  Total confusion
The original English settlers were probably the most intolerant lot
of people to ever assemble  However the Founding Fathers
Washington Jefferson Madison etc practically made it their
life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy
their great experiment a democratic republic

I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's and
Madison's writings Particularly good is Madison's somethingand
Remonstrance yea I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells
   IMHO Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American's
who ever lived Although both were products of their time Jefferson
was a slave owner they were able to see more clearly than their
contemporaries and for that matter more clearly than most modern
politicians Their prose is the epitome of eloquence I don't know
about y'all but reading the Declaration of Independence give me
mental goosebumps For those who have never read it I am appending a
copy of it



In CONGRESS July  

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and
equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle
them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation

We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created
equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness  That to secure these rights Governments are instituted
among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it
and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness  Prudence
indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience
hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are
sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which
they are accustomed  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations
pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to
throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future
security

Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies and such is
now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems
of Government  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States  To
prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world

He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary
for the public good

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing
importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should
be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend
to them

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large
districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of
Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and
formidable to tyrants only

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual
uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public
Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with
his measures

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with
manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people

He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause
others to be elected whereby the Legislative powers incapable of
Annihilation have returned to the People at large for their exercise
the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of
invasion from without and convulsions within

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States for that
purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners
refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and
raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his
Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of
their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries

He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of
Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance

He has kept among us in times of peace Standing Armies without the
consent of our legislatures

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to
the Civil power

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his Assent to
their Acts of pretended Legislation
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us
For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders
    which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent
For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring
    Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government and
    enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example
    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into
    these Colonies
For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws and
    altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments
For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested
    with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever

He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection
and waging War against us

He has plundered our seas ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns and
destroyed the lives of our people

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to
complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun
with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized
nation

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas
to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioners of
their friends and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured
to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian
Savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction
of all ages sexes and conditions

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in
the most humble terms  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only
by repeated injury  A Prince whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free
people

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature
    to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and
    settlement here
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity
    and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow
    these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections
    and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice of justice 
    and of consanguinity
We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
    Separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies 
    in War in Peace Friends

We therefore the Representatives of the united States of America in
General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the
world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the Name and by the
authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and
declare  That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be
Free and Independent States that they are Absolved from all
Allegiance to the British Crown and that all political connection
between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally
dissolved and that as Free and Independent States they have full
Power to levy War conclude Peace contract Alliances establish
Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States
may of right do  And for the support of this Declaration with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to
each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor

 Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth

 You are making a ludicrous suggestion
 
 As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

And as an agnostic who's slightly aware of the Mormon Wars that Casper
describes I'd side with him on this Not that I support the Koreshians nor
do I support the Mormons but in a nasty sense the major difference is
this in  the Mormons kicked the US Army's ass In  the
Koreshians died in an inferno Chances are if things had turned out a
little differently we might have Koreshians posting to the Net a hundred
years from now talking about some future analogous event

	   One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
   the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday One can argue about
   the initial raid but it would be worth mentioning before the facts get
   lost that

	    The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	   during the initial raid

	    The Branch Davidians opened fire first

Sigh I was waiting some some notsointelligent person to bring this
up  Look this is a country of laws To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance

 th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses 
 papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 
 shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon 
 probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and 
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
 or things to be seized 

No a noknock warrant is in clear violation of the th amendment
Okay what about the fact that they were tipped off  they shouldn't
have opened fire  right  WRONG  Think about this I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a noknock warrant So
being moronic sheep we wait with our guns holstered Now instead of
the Feds in comes my competition and we're history  The only
acceptable answer to a noknock warrant is blazing guns  I may sound
paranoid but our government is out of control and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it

   on Larry King's Live yesterday and the survivors claim the fire was started
   from the outside

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans  This may not even be an
accurate statement anyway since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information  We'll have to wait
   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say  Their credibility
is shot anyway since they origianlly said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover  We saw how accurate that was
   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves  You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people  All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

	Viewing from the net's initial reaction to the selfimmolation of the
Branch Davidians it would appear that this human tragedy is too flagrant
for some folks to keep from using it to push their peevish little ideologies
Others could not help but exercise comic relief but given the tension I
think this reaction is understandable My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmer
who makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts

	Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition

as if the public deaths of over  people were not a clear and definite 
warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets

	From where I set looks like Satan has a threebagger going

I'm short of patience tonite but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  
than the BDs got
 
 Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
 truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
 Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
 but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
 for destroying a people

The government sure gets a lot of mileage out of the word cult

Koresh's lawyers is most articulate on this point I think  The BATF
originally had a search warrant based on information that indicated
BD members converted semiautomatic weapons to fullauto  A
search warrant is a right to search not a right to bring a small
army for an Iwo Jima style assault  Everything the BATF did from
the start seemed designed to maximize the reaction they would get
from Koresh

	One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday One can argue about
the initial raid but it would be worth mentioning before the facts get
lost that

	 The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	during the initial raid

	 The Branch Davidians opened fire first

	It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians according to
the FBI's statements opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warning
over the phone and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenades
did so under fire from the compound


 
 The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act but that was
 an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started  War is bad

Even this seemingly obvious issue is far from settled  According to
Newsweek  some federal lawenforcement officials
now believe that at least some ATF agents were brought down by
friendly fire  The articles goes on to say how sources close to the
Justice Department claim that some agents were caught in heavy crossfire

	Clearly no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial 
shootout That's why they went in with riot control gas This would have worked
with minimal casualties The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gas
masks if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind



 precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation  That principle
 applies to all cases of warfare whether it's between nuclear superpowers
 feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt  Why
 was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
 also have worked  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than
 peoples' lives and religious beliefs  Perhaps the supposed professionals in
 our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid

Actually from a tactical standpoint the original raid on the BATF was
horribly planned  Sources in the FBI have been quoted extensively 
criticizing the BATF plan  The BATF raid does make sense however if
it was timed and planned to garner maximum media exposure for the BATF
which is always in danger of losing funding
	
Go in bust a few cultist heads wind up on the  pm news and you
don't have to worry about the budget for the next  years

	The question is whether yesterday's raid was wired tightly enough
Reno and Sessions both made statements to the press indicating that the
experts had not indicated that such a reaction was possible  likely 
They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masadalike mass suicide
could result from the introduction of nonlethal agents into the compound

	Some of these issues are highly technical  the impression I have
is that the Ranch Apocalypse represented a Rubrik's cube for the
counterterrorist types The Branch Davidians were too well armed for 
for a simple assault the BATF found this out the hard way The complex
was probably to big for the kind of surgical Delta Force coup de main
that the Bundesgrenschutz did in the s when one of their airliners
was highjacked by Black September The reason this seige had gone on
as long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options
and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice


Similarly why the raid yesterday  Reno has a bunch of different
answers she's shopping around none f which make much senOn
Nightline tonight she tried the we were concerned about child abuse
card and then it was pointed out that the info on the child abuse
was over two weeks old  Then she switched to the It couldn't go
on any longerstyle stuff until that kind of played out

	My own theory is that something was supposed to have happened
on Easter Koresh had made some statements building that idea up and 
Easter came and went with nothing happening It may be that the authorities
felt emboldened to move for this reason IT IS just a theory


Why yesterday  Because this was turning into a huge embarassment for
the Clinton administration

	I don't believe this is a valid argument Obviously hindsight
is  but the risks of doing anything to provoke the Davidians
were clear enough to warrant caution and to delay action


  It was interesting to watch the  club today  Pat Robertson said that the
 Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god He
 also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it 
 However I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
 world had a similarly humble 'cultstatus' beginning even and perhaps
 especially christianity  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
 Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled  Maybe David
 Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
 new major religion to me

Ever notice how quickly Christians adopt atheist arguments when it comes
to other religious groupslike every other denominationreligion is
irrational except their own particular one

	I imagine there are a good many people who are having some problems
processing the reality of this affair now 

	 This matter ties in with the infamous social scientists are not
	really scientists brouhaha on sciskeptic Here is a case where if
	one believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI the
	predictions of psychological experts were proven false not under
	laboratory conditions but in the cauldron of practical application

	 Koresh's actions or the actions of whoever started the fire  
	we're not likely to know what went on in there contrast so violently
	with the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find it
	difficult to understand why or how this happened Under such 
	conditions the search for scapegoats is only too natural a human
	reaction even though that is not a particularly Christian response
	either

	 Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult 
	members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex Her 
	grief must be monumental at this time and the search for a way to
	escape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewise
	real We may not have seen the end to the self depravation

	 The fact simply stated is that a good number of innocent children
	and notsoinnocent adults died horribly for no good reason It is
	exceptionally hard for us as human beings to accept this fact
	We can hope for some ultimate salvation some panacea to make it
	better but even though hope is a wonderful thing that doesn't
	make it so There is no meaning to this thing It just is

 Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the FBI
 Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers  Sick and    sad

Jesus allowed himself to be killed  Many of his followers have killed

 No  I make a distinction between working for yourself to survive and
 paying dues to Mother Nature in the form of labour and working for
 Joe propertyowner because you do not have the option of working for
 yourself  Joe propertyowner stands between you and the earth you
 work and expects you to pay him and mother nature for the right
 to survive  The property laws create a layer of parasites that get
 fat on the fact that people have no option except to work in
 factories  
 
I want people to be able to get the things they need in life  Property
ownership may not be ideal but it is far better at letting people get
what they need to live a productive fulfulling life

The first experiment in America where property ownership was denied
caused starvation hunger and death  Few people know that the
Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a
common food store  Many people know the hardships they suffered the
first few winters because of it  After arriving the Pilgrims made all
property common  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops
went into a common store  After much debate the new Governor Bradford
privitized the land assigning plots to each family  According to Perry
D Westbrook  The change was immediately justified by the increased
industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted

Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism  He wrote  The
experience that was had in this common course and condition tried
sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men may well evince the
vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of
later times that the taking away of property and bringing in community into
a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing as if they were wiser
than God  For this community so far as it was was found to breed much
confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been
to their benefit and comfort

Bradford did not blame this failure on the strangers but on the basic
selfishness in all men  He wrote seeing all men have this corruption in
them God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them  In other
words according to Westbrook Bradford found private enterprise to be
the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state

Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made  Private
property allows a society to flourish the alternative brings
starvation poverty and discontent

Top Ten Ways Slick Willie Could Improve His Standing With Americans



 Institute a national sales tax to pay for the socialization of
    America's health care resources

  Declare war on Serbia Reenact the draft

  Stimulate the economy with massive income transfers to Democtratic
    constituencies

  Appoint an unrepetent socialist like Mario Cuomo to the Suprmeme Court

  Focus like a laser beam on gays in the military

  Put Hillary in charge of the Ministry of Truth and move Stephanopoulos
    over to socialzed health care

  Balance the budget through confiscatory taxation

  Remind everyone again how despite the Democrats holding the
    Presidency the majority of seats in the House and in the Senate
    the Republicans have still managed to block his taxandspend programs

  Go back to England and get a refresher course in European Socialism

  Resign now

 Clayton Cramer

 But what came out in much lower profile reporting was that the
 victim was a prostitute and the man had not paid her  hence the
 false accusation

 There was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute the
 defense merely alledged that she was

The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was
presented as evidence that she was a prostitute and the court
apparently found this compelling

 Even Clayton knows the difference  Err perhaps Clayton doesn't know
 the difference

Clayton does indeed know the difference  Greg apparently doesn't

 the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the Marines
 were engaged in selfdefense

 No the judge found that the prosecution did not carry out the burder
 on proof

Because the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the
Marines were engaged in selfdefense  Got it knucklehead

 A small clipping from clarinews under fair use guidelines 

    New Hanover District Court Judge Jacqueline MorrisGoodson ruled in
    the benchtrial that the state failed to carry its burden in proving
    the Marines acted to cause injury

Because in part REPEAT AFTER ME the judge found that there was
some credible evidence that the Marines were engaged in selfdefense
Hopefully one of these days you will understand

 Interesting that in  of the  cases Clayton does what he accuses
 others of doing

With respect to credibility I would rate Clayton Cramer an order of
magnitude higher than a the news media and b homosexuals

 These two paragraphs are from two different posts  In splicing them 
  together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent
  him in any way  I don't think I've done so 

As noted in another thread Limiting govt the problem libertarians face
is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the 
tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda
 
It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams  Just
as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition

		   Patrick's example of anticompetitive regulations for
            auto dealers deleted
Here's what I see libertarianism offering you

This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream but basic human decency
and common sense  A real grassroots example of freedom and liberty
And yes not having a few people acting as our masters approving or
rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other does strike me
as a wonderful way to improve the human condition

   Thanks awfully
             Patrick

Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues  As
I've noted before I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of 
eliminating anticompetitive legislation with regard to auto dealers
barbers etc  One need not however swallow the entire libertarian
agenda to accomplish this end  Just because one grants the benefits of
allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell hisher services without
regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be 
free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention  
As somemany libertarians would argue  

On a case by case basis the costbenefit ratio of government regulation
is obviously worthwhile  The libertarian agenda however does not call
for this assessment  It assumes that the costs of regulation of any
kind always outweigh its benefits  This approach avoids all sorts of 
difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic 
to say the least

I have no objection to an analysis of medical care education 
national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide
a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives
than is provided through statist approaches   With some notable
exceptions however I do not see such nittygritty worthwhile 
analysis being carried out by selfprofessed libertarians

The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

So you approve of the BATF launching a person raid complete
with flack jackets men hidden in horse trailers stun grenades
semiauto weapons on peaceful citizens  who would also accept
a search authoried by a court

There is still no proof that the Branch Davidians had illegal weapons
Nothing else was in the jurisdiction of the BATF unless they were
thought to have a still or be smoking untaxed cigarettes

The automatic firearms violation is a TAX matter   You don't serve
noknock warrants on someone with  CAL MGs  It isn't necessary
they can't flush a machine gun down a toilet you know and it isn't
smart if you are right you got a good chance of getting blown away
if you are wrong you shouldn't have done it


The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 

The stupidity was indeed related to this  But the stupidity may have been to
attempt to serve the warrant by ludicrously overarmed overprotected
and overconfident gestapo  Escalation isn't automatically brilliant

IT WAS A TAX MATTER   YOU CANT FLUSH MGs DOWN THE TOILET 
YOU DONT NEED NOKNOCK WARRANTS FOR EVERYTHING

Actually IMHO nothing justifies them but that is another argument 


If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it

There wasn't any murder of police officers  There was probable cause
to arrest them for murder perhaps  We US citizens are innocent until proven
guilty

There also wasn't any killing until the BATF screwed up real bad

I think you just supported his point What did you mean by the
end of the Republic Do you think this hasn't happened yet

  Correct  You'd have to be very unfamiliar with US history to 
  think that we have substantially fewer rights today than in 
  in   The police could generally get away with a lot more
  in those days there were few citizens and media watchdog 
  organizations no Miranda rulings and women blacks gays
  and other such groups had very few right indeed  Moreover
  censorship of media and similar artistic expression was rampant
  at that time think about banned in Boston or the Hays
  Commission  

  My comments were directed against those who see these sorts
  of incidents as proof that rights as we know them are about to 
  vanish

 Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
 better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

	Firstly they could have backed off  When you put a power freak like
David Koresh in that kind of situation he is going to explode  no pun
intended  Koresh wanted to be a martyr and the government played right into
his hands

	If the government hadn't given him the attention he wanted nothing
would have ever happened

	Secondly the Davidians were expecting everything the government did 
They thought that they were facing the apocalypse and that they were to perish
in fire  They weren't scared of the FBI  They are not the average hoods they
are very devout followers of a religion  PsyOps didn't work and the government
got frustrated so they murdered them 

	The BATF should have left at the beginning they should have looked at
Koresh's personality  Instead they thought They have guns  We have bigger
guns  Let's go get 'em

	They botched it from day one  They shouldn't have been there in the
first place


The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

	The search was a noknock warrent  Meaning that what
those on the scene see is a bunch of men with guns storming 
their compound and lobbing grenades at them  The terms of the
search warrent are secret and the BATF has yet to even reveal
what they were




The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 

	They did not serve a warrent they basically attacked the
compound and expected a surrender  They had semiautomatics and
concussion grenades that we KNOW about  

	Look at the death and injury toll inflicted on both sides in the first
battle and its difficult to believe that either side had any
superiority in weapons


If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it

	A few questions for Janet Reno

	Why don't you think generals have any place in law enforcement

	If the ATFFBI had proof that Koresh was

		A child molester
		A child abuser
		A wife abuser
		Bigamist
		Sexual Deviant not a crime in all  states yet
	As well as
		Illegally modify weapons

	Why wasn't he simply arrested during one of his morning jogs  Why did
the allegations of childwifesex crimes only come out after the Branch
Davidians repelled the initial assualt

	Was it because it became necessary to demonize David Koresh  Do you
feel responsible for the deaths of over  people  How many would be alive to
day if Koresh had been arrested outside the compound


	Inquiring minds want to know

	Although Janet was installed after the siege began her purge of the
justice dept leaves only her people in charge

 Well the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
 if the oppertunity presented itself

 I reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
 huge variety of willing partners

If true and if gays were the same as straights except
for sexual preference I would imagine that gays would
have much less sex than straights because the available
pool for dates is less than onetenth what it is for
straights  Somebody correct flame me please


You miss the point  A lot more negotiation is needed to convince women
to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with 
their sex  Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather
than be known as a slag slut or whore

With men however there is status attached to being able to fuck 
constantly  And with gay men where both partners can prove status
through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation
where there is a lot of sex

The difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity
and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the appetites of men

Straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned gay men who
do not experience this bottle neck go to excess

Janet Reno killed the Waco children  She is responsible for
their deaths  She should resign immediately  She should have 
understood that David Koresh was a madman who would do anything
against the children if he became provoked  All the warning 
signs were there and she ignored them  She provoked Koresh
into killing the children

The situation in Waco was similar to a hostage situation with 
a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person
In such a situation a person who provokes the madman and causes 
him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the
hostage  Janet Reno blindly stumbled in there and basically
threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would
release the hostage  It's no surprise that the madman would
pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation

 The Jews who found themselves alone against
Rome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the one
faced by the Branch Davidians The latter in reality would likely
have been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes
Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely It is highly
unlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been been
imprisoned for very long

As members of a cult that murdered federal agents I suspect the
government would provide them with housing with a lease longer
than that given to the followers of Charlie Manson  Especially since
they have a much larger cheering section among the general population
so the government has a lot more to prove

For Immediate Release                             April  



                  STATEMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON


I am deeply saddened by the loss of life in Waco today  My 
thoughts and prayers are with the families of David Koresh's 
victims

The law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege 
recommended the course of action pursued today  The Attorney 
General informed me of their analysis and judgment and 
recommended that we proceed with today's action given the risks 
of maintaining the previous policy indefinitely  I told the 
Attorney General to do what she thought was right and I stand by 
that decision

tfarrelllynxdacnortheasternedu Thomas Farrell said

 A good case A FKING GOOD CASE The defense lawyer asked the victim
 questions like what kind of sexual perversions do you participate
 in  and you think he made a good case

Speaking as someone who's only about six weeks and a  tuition bill
away from becoming an unemployed slob with a law degree I'd really like
to see a transcript of this trial  I'd especially like to know what
happened immediately after the defense attorney asked that question
assuming that the reports that he did so are accurate I'm not
accusing Tom Farrell of making anything up but this is the sort of
case that spawns garbled misquotes false rumors and urban legends like
tribbles  It'd be nice to think that the prosecutor objected
irrelevant prejudicial inflammatory take your pick and that the
judge upheld the objection

	Having watched most of the televised trial I can answer that
when such statements were made by the defense atty the prosecutor did
object and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously
falling under the selfincrimination type of objection  There was
quite a bit of metadiscussion during the trial over the use of graphic
language with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the
exact language  Practically every time the defense tried to get the
plaintiffs to selfincriminate by asking them such questions there
were objections and sustains

	At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about
solicitation for a felony and the judge herself said sustained
before the prosecutor could get the objection stated

     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough

 The median of a distribution is that variatevalue which divides the

 Mr Cramer

 You are on one hand condemning the news media as

 The Role of the National News Media in Inflaming Passions that
 was your message subject I believe

 Then you turn around and actually take From the Santa Rosa Cal PressDemocrat
 April   p B 

 Male sex survey Gay activity low title

 You even use such a title for the San Jose Mercury News the Murky News

 Now which is it  Are you going to comdemn national media then turn around
 and use it to support some position you present  Seems somewhat contradictory
 doesn't it

I believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that
the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the
subject at hand  The media has proven itself very accurate
is the areas of presenting raw undisputed data  One good
example would be the weather page in which high and low
temperatures of the previous day for a large number of
locations are posting  There is little evidence to show
that they are in error

The American media has failed us in its analysis of complex
events however  I'm sure that we can come up with many
news stories that have left us angry because so many facts
have been ommitted  Cases that come to mind are the
invasion of Panama the war with Iraq the disaster in Waco
the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the
military the war on drugs and many others

The story that you bring to light was regarding the new
sex survey  While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of
the data was ommitted from the article I would venture to
guess that the data that was presented did not deviate
from the survey  I do however think that it would be
folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's
analysis of this data  In this particular case there was
little analysis and the reader was left to draw hisher
own convictions

Many netters Mr Cramer included often forget that the
American media are merely a number of businesses who's
purpose in life is to make money for their owners and
stockholders  Revenues come largely from advertisers
who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar  The
media is like fast food the quality of the food or of
the reporting will improve only if the customers demand
as such  Otherwise it is business as usual

                 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY



The initiative will involve the creation of new products to 
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure 
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links



A stateoftheart microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has 
been developed by government engineers  The chip represents a 
new approach to encryption technology  It can be used in new 
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to 
an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications 
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in 
commercial use today

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary 
information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations 
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted 
electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the 
ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to 
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

       While also allowing law enforcement agencies to intercept phone
conversations of criminals and noncriminals unlawfully  No Rev
King we aren't spying on you

       I wonder how long it will take for the wrong people to put their
hands on the equipment necessary to read this stuff  It'll probably
be as safe as weapons locked safely in evidence rooms

keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government 
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the 
device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately 
in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the 
Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to 
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a 
wiretap

       And people to whom they sell them to  All it takes is corrupting
the right guy  No that never happens

   population is gay used the criteria of No heterosexual contact in the 
   past year  But at the same time the University of Denver study points 
   out quite dramatically that  of all selfidentifying gay men have 
  had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year 
 
 I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual 
 contact of any kind in the previous year they are counted as heterosexual
 Even if they didn't intend it that way that's how the figures are being used

Could someone please post some date such as what questonnares where used

 They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
 nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building
 

Before you go absolving the BATF  FBI of all blame in this incident you should
probably be aware of two important facts
  There is no such thing as nontoxic tear gas  Tear gas is nonbreathable
    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting followed eventually
    by siezures and death  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people
    they exposed  Any potential heart problems among the BD's

  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister  Tear gas is produced by burning a
    chemical in the can  The fumes produced are tear gas  The canister has a 
    warning printed on the side of it  Contact with flamable material can result
    in fire  Now how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building 
    they admited was a firetrap

This whole thing was a case of overreaction by the officials at every step
I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held
accountable  But that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to
be investigating themselves

Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and
Vancouver BC  The nongun rates were roughly the same for both cities  The
difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gunrelated  

        And as was not pointed out in the study but in critiques
of it two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come
to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost
entirely minority related  That is the gun crime rate skyrocketed
for poor minorities Blacks and Hispanics primarily while when you
compared the white majority they were virutally identical

Many of the people who never read the NEJM article believe that this
critique is valid  In fact the study explores the minority issue at length
and cites studies to back up its contention that poverty not minority
type is the relevant factor in violence statistics  

      Perhaps I failed to make myself clear  Minorities in the US
correlate with poverty  This isn't good and we should address it
but we shouldnt' ignore that minorities and poverty do tend to go
together

      Does Vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along
racial lines  If it doesn't then assumptions of being able to compare
minority vs majority in both cities is questionable at best


Post hoc ergo propter hoc  Those areas implemented gun control because of
the high rates  

       True only to a certain extent  Take Washington DC where
gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true but that
crime proceeded to explode afterwards  Similarly for New York

Actually I don't know whether any serious studies have been done for both
cities  Usenetstyle statistical arguments are not very serious usually
involving people sitting by computers with the latest World Almanac figures
I had heard of a study on Washington DC that seemed to indicate a significant
drop in gunrelated violence there after the laws were implemented  I heard
Gary Kleck comment on the radio that he thought the decline in suicide rates
was related to the new laws but he doubted their affect on other gunrelated
violence  I have never seen a report on the study nor have any of my progun
friends had much to say about that report  Remember you can't just say that
crime increases indicate a failure of the laws to affect crime rates  You don't
know whether the rate of increase would have been different without the
laws   

       If the rate of increase over a period of several years remains
unchanged or increases I think it's not a far jump to say that the laws
are not effective  No you can't sit down and say that things wouldn't
have been worse  I don't have a crystal ball and neither do you  However
that road leads us to a place where it is impossible to critique any
action  If it gets down to be It might have been worse without them
then there is no valid objection which I'm sure would amuse certain
people to no end

You don't know whether the laws prevented a threefoldincrease or 
failed to stop a twofold increase  

       So we've got a situation where we have several options

	  The crime rate decreased  Obviously gun control worked

	  The crime rate remained the same  It would have been worse
	without gun control

	  The crime rate increased  Perhaps the laws prevented an
	even bigger increase

       Cute testing ground we've got  All responses support the proposition
that gun control works

       The question is this  Did Washington DC experiance an increase
in its violent andor gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern
indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws  If it did then
the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to
control did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws

Wait a second you're ignoring major facts here

	from the official version to the dissident statements of BATF
	officers who conducted the raid claims that the Davidians were
	shooting at the agents long before they were within grenade

	What I saw on TV and what you claim are two different things The
Davidians did not start shooting until after the BATF lobbed a couple
genades in the windows and started shooting themselves

	Also if the warrant is sealed how do we know it was a 'noknock'  

	EASY If you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns
going in throught windows that is a NoKnock warrant Also since the 
videotape shows the BATF throwing grenades before the BD's etunred fire 
you can safely assume that they didn't ring the doorbell

Not really  The percentage of gays was low  Headline writers aren't
noted for accuracy

But you stated that this study was presented in a very accurate and
dependable way  This is confusing to the issue

And if you read this title it implies that gay sex homosexual sex
activities are low compared to the general population that they surveyed


     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American men's sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
      percent of the men surveyed HAD ENGAGED in homosexual sex and
        
      percent considered themselves EXCLUSIVELY homosexual   
        
 									     
Actually  were either exclusively homosexual or bisexual  You aren't
readiing very carefully

Well let us quibble look at the above statement that you posted I have marked
it with '' IT STATES THAT  ARE EXCLUSIVELY HOMOSEXUAL IT STATES  ARE

And please not the use of adjective here HOMOSEXUAL SEX

Now I stated that if we take  as homosexal this is a valid viewpoint

     IT IS A MATTER OF LOGIC that governmentrun systems are

     sector system in the US is vastly more inefficient is therefore
     irrelevant  

	Proof that the entire private sector is vastly more inefficient

Good point Brett  It might merely be proof that basic health care
markets operate differently with certain nonmarket phenomenom that
the private sector can't handle well like armies vs warlords In
that respect the effects on American society vs CanadianEuropean
society might also be different

 	It is for example of no relevance that Blue Cross
     of Massachusetts employs  people more than are employed in
     all of Canada's health programs which insure  times as many
     people

Blue Cross is the government health insurance provider

Good point again  Blue Cross in the US is quite convoluted compared
to the Canadian and German insurance funds which have a minimal
organization to coordinate it  If anything bureaucracy now needs to
be built up in Canada to combat fraud such as Americans crossing the
border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and
relatives or using phony domestic addresses or fraud rings stealing
them in blocks  Our private practices are now recording insurance
account numbers both public insurance and private insurance which
most have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour

Saw it in tpm thanks


In article CqKtqKvodernsccom
mattgalaxynsccom Matt Freivald x said

 I like to call the form of government that I advocate Fractal
 Federalism  With Fractal Federalism there is a representative
 national government that has only certain limited powers to do what is
 absolutely necessary at that level  Next there are the state
 governments again with only absolutely necessary powers  Onward to
 counties citiestownships districts and neighborhoods

  The lowest read most local levels are the ones that have the
 most power over individuals' daytoday lives which is good because
 that is the level where individuals have the most voice

You know if you take all this to its logical conclusion doesn't it
seem that the real lowest level the level where individuals have
the most voice is that of the single individuals themselves  Why have
you omitted that level from your model

Yes and the individual is not omitted I just didn't fully articulate the 
principles of Fractal Federalism  All government powers derive from the
People each level can receive a new power from the level below through 
the amendment process where a true consensus say a  majority writes 
that power into the Constitution of the level above in the case of the 
lowest level an amendement is passed by a  majority vote in the case 
of higher levels it must be passed by  of the legislatures  We can
of course haggle about the specifics of true consensus when we hold our 
Constitutional Convention   Once a power has been granted it may be 
exercised by the legislature  Powers not in the original Constitutions must 
percolate upward starting from the individual  The ratification process 
for the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a 
plurality or majority

Granting a right in a constitution is of course the same as empowering
the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments
at the lower levels so it operates in the same way as the amendment process 
again that crazy resemblance to the supposedbutnotactual US government 
structure

This government structure is a very frustrating one for those people read
liberals who would like to have concentrated power to use the government
to force people to do good a difficulttodefine word and one that it 
is difficult to reach a consensus on  It is also a frustrating structure 
for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior read 
biggovernment conservatives  I personally would rather see those types
of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty both civil and 
economic that is going on now

This is IMHO a good government stucture for those who see the role of
government as the protection of individual liberties while still recognizing
that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that
they live in


  A free market works on government not just economics  Succesful
 ideas propogate unsuccessful ideas die

What is your definition of a successful idea or a successful
government

One which maintains peace liberty and the opportunity for happiness for its
people while working within the realities of human nature  You do bring
up the point intentional or not that a lasting idea is by no means
necessarily a successful idea  I believe that Fractal Federalism would
at least bring many ideas to light and The People would have the opportunity
to democratically choose between good ideas and bad ideas  If the
Docialists er I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a
prosperous People they will have a plethora of local opportunities to  
check their thesis  If Libertopia is possible it will arise  If a balanced
Conservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of
government activity it will become clear to The People that it is best



 As far as set the moral tone is concerned if a community does not
 collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of
 their kids why should they have to  If a community does not want to
 see proliferation of drugs among their kids why should they have to

For the same reason that they have to put up with a church operating
right out in the open where their kids can see it and with the owner
of the house across the street flying an American flag right out there
in the open every day in front of their kids  It's called freedom
If they don't like the ideas to which their kids are exposed they can
try to educate and persuade their kids as to why the things that they're
seeing other people doing are wrong or bad

Right and people would not rescind any freedoms read empower the
government except through the amendment process  That is how the Federal 
Government is supposed to work now but the Supreme Soviet er I mean the 
Supreme Court put a stop to that republican government nonsense

In my hypothetical government if there were a constitutional provision
empowering the government to regulate churches the government whatever
level we are talking about could indeed ban churches  The constitutional
provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision
protecting free exercise of religion  The uppermost Constitution is still
the Supreme Law of the Land



I find it interesting that you applaud the idea of freemarket
competition among various ideas and yet support the right of he
majority in a community to suppress ideas which they don't like

It is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations
and environment not a matter of suppression of ideas

One dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty and
they also need to have some control over their environment  In my
Fractal Federalism government certain rights are protected by the 
constitutions  Other rights are protected simply because the government 
has not been empowered to infringe upon them  When a consensus is reached
that the government should have a certain power then freedom is infringed
upon  This cannot be avoided  murder statutes infringe upon freedom
but I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes
are a good idea

I am sure that many parents believe that they have a right to control
the environment that their children live in  People feel that they have
a right to sleep peacefully at night thus there are noise ordinances
There are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential
neighborhoods  I do not view these as bad things certainly some individual
instances are bad but the concept is not necessarily bad I view them
as the people in a community having some control over the type of community
that they live in  I see the alternative as near anarchy

Like I said in another post if you can come up with a scenario where an 
individual can do something truly autonomously  with absolutely zero
effect on anyone else  then no individual or government has the right
to restrict that activity  There are simply not very many behaviors that
fit into the category of the truly autonomous so the whole thing becomes
an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual
or group  I think that the Fractal Federalism approach is a sound if
not ideal approach to limiting this restrictive power  The libertarian 
scenario degenerates to might makes right and the system we have right
now is one of lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what 
powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process 
though the Supreme Court



 The problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the
 fundamental dilemma of democratic government The People have a right
 to exercise a voice in their community yet individuals have the right
 to be left to themselves  This is a serious dilemma precisely because
 there is not much that takes place in a vacuum

Oddly enough if what you say is taken literally there is little or no
conflict the people do indeed have a right to exercise a voice  where
voice equals persuasive speech in their communities it's only
when they somehow get the idea into their heads that they also have a
right to dictate behavior in their communities that the trouble begins

I think I answered this above already but let me expand a little more
with an example  If I stand naked in front of your house and masturbate 
in front of your children while they play in your libertarian small 'l'
scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me  Autonomous is
a value judgement  of the time it is not a scientific reality with
a clear definition  Exactly who would you empower to make that value
judgement



stuff deleted

 Certainly not the only cause Mike but people in a local neighborhood
 should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood  To deny
 this is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the
 locality from abusing its power  in essence using a pit bull to
 keep a toy poodle from biting your leg  Chances are the pit bull is
 going to turn on you some day and you have much less defense against
 it than you do against the toy poodle

The argument here appears to be that tyranny of the individual by the
local majority is superior to having the federal government have and
exercise the power to protect the individual from his neighbors because
that federal government will eventually and inevitably become corrupt
and use its power to tyrannize everyone  Okay there's a lot of truth in
that certainly we're seeing something like that happening in the United
States today though it's unclear that he progression here matches the
model since our beloved and benign federal government hasn't
evershown much enthusiasm for the idea of protecting any individuals

Lots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions
Although I am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit I am at least
trying to be long on solutions also  I am truly interested if you have
any improvements to make on my ideas I call them my ideas but they
all come from an average guy reading of the US Constitution without
benefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia



But I have to say that I think that your solution is at least just as
bad  Trading the yoke of federal tyranny for the yoke of local tyranny
doesn't cheer me up much I think I'd prefer to put my faith in a
larger government that at least might protect the individual from time
to time rather than place it in local mob rule  Admittedly it's the
lesser of two evils and it's not less by very much and they're both
pretty damn evil

Sorry the confusion was my fault  When I said that Fractal Federalism 
resembles the US constitution I meant it and thought it was pretty clear  
I should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government
power is from the CONSENSUS of the people although not the CONSENT of every
individual a practical observation not a moral judgement  It is certainly 
better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers which is the
situation we have now  That is why I think the Supreme Court should be
a jury court with a different jury for each case  

It is certainly not perfect no philosophy of government is but do you still 
find it a repugnant idea  If so what is your solution



 Ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government
 coercive power of any kind would be necessary  This will never work
 because people are different and by their nature they will always want
 to force their views on others  If this were not the case nobody
 would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else

This is true the question is what we you going to do about it  Your
proposed solution seems to actually encourage these bozos to lord it
over their victims

I think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government I
advocate and it was my fault for not being more clear



Oh and by the way

Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

For starters they could have gone on waiting and negotiating  The Davidians
weren't going anywhere and their supplies had to be limited  Large perhaps
but limited  If they had simply fired the compound by themselves without
gov't tanks smashing down their walls then at least the gov't would not be
guilty of having again used an inappropriate level of force and would have
been able to use the meantime to continue to pressure and negotiate  No they
would not have looked good on the news in six months or a year  But they sure
as hell don't look very good now

  True  Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church
  leader who is now a consultant on cults  He said the FBI's approach
  was totally wrong  He said they should have tried to break down the 
  BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means   Koresh's whole
  theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces 
  of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this  The Feds
  played into his hands PERFECTLY   By surrounding the compound
  with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them 
  they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was
  evil and threatening    He said instead they should have set up 
  a picnic atmosphere and acted inviting and friendly  If they
  broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving 
  relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'
  childhoods   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender
  seem like a pleasant desirable alternative   Interesting comments

Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely It is highly
unlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been been
imprisoned for very long

We will see what will happen to the survivors  Don't forget however
that the members of the cult are responsible for the deaths of  ATF
agents  Do you really expect Koresh dead or alive to take sole 
responsibility for this  I can just see it now survivior at trial

  There is no such thing as nontoxic tear gas  Tear gas is nonbreathable
    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting followed eventually
    by siezures and death  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people
    they exposed  Any potential heart problems among the BD's

	They certainly knew that there were pregnant women in there plus 
children  I could not believe when they said that the gassing was
an attempt to save the children yesterday  I can't think of a much
worse sort of child abuse that pouring tear gas into a building


  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister  Tear gas is produced by burning a
    chemical in the can  The fumes produced are tear gas  The canister has a 
    warning printed on the side of it  Contact with flamable material can result
    in fire  Now how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building 
    they admited was a firetrap

	I have heard two things recently explaining this

	 They pumped the gas into the building from outside via some
	sort of pipe rather than by canister

	 The sort of tear gas they are using was described as some
	sort of powdery material that sticks to things  Kind of
	like a powder cloud

	And once again these are government lacky explainations and
	since government stories always change none or all of the
	information might not be true


This whole thing was a case of overreaction by the officials at every step
I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held
accountable  But that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to
be investigating themselves

	Or better yet the Texas rangers will be investigating which is
probably worse than the FBI or ATF investigating itself

At all times in human history people have killed and stolen from one
another  If you can find an example of where this hasn't happened in
history then you have discovered a new phenomenon in nature

particular matter should be left up to the individual or not but it is
the nature of humans to kill and steal from others and you will not find

Child mortality has always been yet we find it in our hearts to have
made an attempt to change that

 Recent studies have been all over the map  So have less recent

This study is from the Battelle Human Affairs Research Centers
in Seattle and was a hot topic in the news last week  The study
questioned at random  men in a face to face interview

This is not a studies but a study  Other studies including the
justpublished Janus Report give very different figures  The Janus
Report figures are not too different than Kinsey  homosexual men
and  bisexual men

 Earlier studies have been all over the map also  

I think he's talking about Kinsey who came up with the 
statistic used heavily by gay groups to push their political agenda
Kinsey's work has often been accused of lacking a strong scientific
backbone  

Don't be stupid  The Kinsey report is one study so it can't be all
over the map all by itself  Other studies including the Battelle
one have also been criticed  As far as agendas go this is really
chutzpah  Your agenda is obvious

the extra exposure to radiation from TMI was

    The naturally occurring catastrophic events disasters that

    not usually leave toxic wastes that prevent people from
    rebuilding their lives there The manmade disasters oil
    spills toxic dumping radioactive waste dispersions cause
    death and make an area unliveable far beyond the initial

OK in the US tell me about some of these deaths and some of these
unliveable areas Oh and if you manage to find some of these unliveable
areas tell me what percentage of the total US land area they are
Hint  the total waste produced by all nuclear reactors in the US can be
safely stored in the area of three footbal fields


 
There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of

I haven't recognized any names from previous discussions but I do
notice that there are a few who blame Clinton for the actions of the
BATF in Waco  Unless you felt the same way about what we did under
Bush's direct command in Panama it's just partisan whining  Which is
what I expect most of it to be  I can see no way to condemn one and not
the other  

But I'm sure some Limbot will tell me how killing thousands of
Panamanian civilians to serve an arrest warrant is much better than
allowing  religious fanatics to commit suicide following a botched
attempt by the BATF to serve a search warrant

These people were breaking the law  I agree these weren't the best tactics
they probably should have backed off pulled the perimeter way back and let
them sit there with no media attention until they decided to come out  The 
only other alternative I see would have been to send in a couple of special

     Look let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense not by
 trying to appeal to emotions and threatening conspiracies  Denounce
 GCA ' as wrong because it's WRONG not because it's based off of a
 law from someone else's government

There's something to be said for beating gun control with reason and 
sense it's intellectually and morally honest

There's also something to be said for using appeal to emotions 
that's the ONLY way the gun control organizations have managed to 
make more progress on the issue in the past  years than gun 
rights activists ever have

     WE THE PEOPLE must state that we find the law unappealing and
 contrary to our freedom  We must use logic and reason and compelling
 arguments  To use emotion and appeal to fear is to lower yourselves
 to the level of your enemies

Yes and it's a damned shame

Members of advocacy groups on both sides of the great American gun
 debate share some rhetorical difficulties in common  Each side is
 committed to overstating the problem it addresses  For the procontrol
 forces that problem is the contribution of guns to violence and
 crime while for the anticontrol forces that problem is the
 procontrol forces  Each set of advocacy group serves as the demon
 by which the other side can rally the troops raising morale and
 money  The public is not enlightened by this war of words because
 neither set of advocates has any stake in merely presenting the plain
 unvarnished truth even to the extent that flawed and biased human
 minds can understand it  Quite the contrary  to tell the truth and
 nothing but the truth would place one side at a distinct disadvantage
 if the other side did not also lay down their propaganda weapons
 Kleck POINT BLANK GUNS AND VIOLENCE IN AMERICA

     A side issue  When talking about the Amendments it bothers
 me to see people acting as if they empower them but require no
 responsibility from them  Free speech also assumes restraint well
 armed militia expects well TRAINED militia

It's well regulated militia but I'll let that pass

Constitutionally it is the responsibility of the STATES to train the
militia  Unfortunately the states relinquished their own independent 
militia units to the National Guard  which can be federalized into 
Army service by the President at any time  in their hunger for federal
funds  And it was the STATES  not the gun owners  who passed laws 
against private citizens engaging in martial drill

So many gun owners train to the remaining lawful limit which training
is almost exclusively administered by the NRA  not the states not
the feds  So don't lecture us on responsibility

 First the median does not imply that half of the men are

 likely zero  

Actually the median is defined as the th percentile  If the
median number of sexual partners for men is  it means that

Yep  and the child that Tree Frog Johnson adbucted for  months reportedly

    forced to associate with truthfully homosexual people

You are quite incoherent Perhaps YOU should be forced to associate with

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT

You appear to be stunningly ignorant of the underlying concept of health
insurance

Are you any less stunningly ignorant  Have you ever heard of life
insurance premiums some companies give in which nonsmokers are charged
much smaller premiums than smokers

Not to mention auto insurance being much cheaper for women under  than
for men under  because women on the average drive more carefully

 I mean how many people actually CARE how many people are gay as long
 as you know how to findavoid them if you want to  I don't

 If you don't care why was so much effort put into promoting the

 obedience

I wouldn't worry too much about it though  We are starting to find
out how politically impotent homosexuals really are  The Colorado
boycott has fizzled Slick Willie was effectively prevented from
implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his
OWN party this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their
claims of large numbers and coming this Saturday they are going to
wind up with TREMENDOUS egg on their face when I submit no more
than perhaps  queers will show up in Washington while they are
promising crowds in the millions  And most of the ones who will be
there will look like ACTUP and Queer Nation not the guy working in
the next cubicle  As if that's really going to play in middle

Sigh  You're absolutely right  We have no political power whatsoever 
Therefore we should be oppressed and ignored and denigrated right  I
certainly hope you don't have an SO sir because if she heard how
disparaging you are towards political minorities and if she had any shred

	The BATF should have left at the beginning they should have looked at
Koresh's personality  Instead they thought They have guns  We have bigger
guns  Let's go get 'em

	They botched it from day one  They shouldn't have been there in the
first place

The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush

        As you're no doubt aware Phill there are probably five or six
different mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on
Feb  all of which are from reputable news sources ranging the the 
Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek

        Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all
flattering the to BATF and produced some question as to who fired first

        Now for all I know you were there to witness it  But
I kind of doubt that

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

        The BATF in a letter they've been sending out to people
says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of
surprise and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it
slammed in their faces

        It strikes me as kind of strange to rely on surprise to
serve a warrant by knocking on the door

        There are at least questions that need to be answered

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish 

        This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original
assault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing
concussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press

Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

        Phill the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for fortyfive
minutes  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they wouldn't have shown up in livestock trailers and would
have retreated immediately

        If they were expecting peacful citizens why show up with over
a hundred officers some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying 
submachineguns and  National Guard Helicopters

        I don't know who did what but as I said there are questions that 
need to be answered

We will see what will happen to the survivors  Don't forget however
that the members of the cult are responsible for the deaths of  ATF

responsibility for this  I can just see it now survivior at trial 
I was just following orders  Where have we heard that before

No Bill my full original post included sufficient disclaimers so that
you could see that I was not claiming that it was a perfect world from
the Branch Davidians point of view The point of my article was that it
is inappropriate to compare Massada and the fate of the Jewish rebels
to Waco The Zealot men faced certain execution in a way that was
anathema to their religion and they knew that their wives and children
would be enslaved American prisons may not be garden spots but they
don't compare to what the survivors of Massada might have faced You
indicate that you agree that the Branch Davidians faced a trial How
does that fact alone make for a comparison here  Even if the
government had wanted to find fall guys for the BATF deaths they
still had to prove it to a jury

Once again my point was quite simpleany comparison between the
situation of the Branch Davidians and the Jews of Massada is absurd

This was obviously a lot different than the ordinary FBI adventure

I believe that the Federal officers had a conflict of interests here

Throught out the whole affair it seamed to me that they were chiefly
concerned with saving face rather than saving lifes  Its true that
The BD were resisting arrest and that they should have surrendered
when they first realized that these where federal officers  But they
didnt  

But when they didnt the FBI should not have treated as a hostage
situation it wasn't  

I think  more discussions possible independant negotiators and
family intervention should have been used

Of course this is just monday morning Quartberbakingor is it


I dont think I shall every forget Reno responding to Ted
Koppels Questions last night  Watching the AG squirm when
telling us that the only reason they stepped it up a bit
was because of there fear for the safety of the Children

who where they serving

   They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
   nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

       Nontoxic tear gas  Do you know what tear gas is

       I do once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
       a teargas grenade in that was supposed to be a joke  The sensation 
       was incredible I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart
       I remember us  a bunch of young men in our early 's  running out
       like a herd of wild animals knocking down the door and jumping
       out of the windows thank Gd we were on the first floor

       I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children

For them the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much
as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully
understanding the cause  Many years ago I was accidentally exposed
to a tiny dose of tear gas  It was in Athens on the street leading
to the American Embassy there'd been a march that had been broken up
with teargas I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the
next day  Aside from the tears feeling sick to my stomach etc
the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling
to pieces and not knowing why it had happenedI was horrified and
wondered what disease or other health problem I had  I didn't find
out about the march and the teargas till hours later  I can imagine
how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children
suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick weak and out of
control of your bodyand not knowing the cause

This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace''  Yeah right

     Male sex survey Gay activity low
 
     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American men's sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
      percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual
 
     The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
     the  percent figure that has been part of the conventional
     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report
 
  So what

Homosexuals lie about the  number to hide the disproportionate
involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  They also lie
about  to keep politicians scared

  It will be interesting to see the reaction when million queers
    gather in Washington DC After all if there are only million of
    us then this is an event unprecidented in history

But many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals but
other members of the leftist agenda

 The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
 The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 
 
 Don't forget that  had  or more partners

Not surprising  Remember that study includes homosexuals as well

 Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
 and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
 homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
 male population  
 
 And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
 who said they where homosexual Or is that number to inconvient for
 you

It wasn't published

 It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
 straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
 how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
 
 Fuck off

Typical homoseuxal response

 Don't forget about the culture  Sadly we don't as a society look upon
 homosexuality as normal and as we are all too well aware there are alot
 of people who condemn it  As a result the gay population is not encouraged
 to develop nonpromiscuous relationships  In fact there are many roadblocks
 put in the way of such committed relationships  It is as if the heterosexual

Such as  Not being able to get married isn't a roadblock to a permanent
relationship  Lack of a marriage certificate doesn't force a couple
to break up  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the 
alternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than 
straights

 Possibly because gaybi men are less likely to get married

 In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive
 the words of a man who has just murdered  children and ordered the 
 suicidemurder of his other  followers According to the account given
 the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met
 by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them The Koreshgun supporter
 claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up If the 
 AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
 grade weaponry than standard issue handguns For all practical purposes
 they were unarmed the BD followers had automatic weapons
 

 The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
 government story This is simply rationalisation It is not enough for 
 them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent That would require
 them to come up with a solution themselves Instead they have to come
 up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
 set out to murder  people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
 to get gun control legislation through
 

I must object to the characterization of those opposed to the
government's handling of the Waco situation as gun supporters
Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as rightwing
gun nuts and just mixes up two issues

I am one of the BATFFBI critics and yet I am a liberal
and just as antigun as you are  I just happen to believe
that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies
They're all human beings not some nest of wasps that
you're trying to exterminate

The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled
the original raid  It was well known that Koresh regularly
went jogging outside his property  He could have been served
with a search warrant then  He could have been arrested if
he had refused to comply  Instead officers armed with grenades
invaded the property  This escalated into a shooting war
with tragic deaths on both sides

Those were the first two mistakes  the bad judgment of
asking for a noknock warrant and the bad and probably
illegal way the alreadyunwise warrant was served

At this point the situation escalated to where it was
described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis
That's when the government started covering their traces
sealing the warrant revising their reported history of
the incident etc

Things were already building up to disaster  Now the
government could have simply closed the supply routes
and waited  But according to Janet Reno that option
had never been seriously considered  So supposedly
because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and
because there supposedly were no backups they felt
they had to go in

Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style
with extreeme Machismo Perhaps thats not the way to handle
it 

It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many
have done that the government is primarily to blame The comparisons
with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous

Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your
post desreves to be taken seriously Peter Nelson also made some
very good points about how a low key approach might have been 
more effective

The point is though that you learn through mistakes The govt
played the wrong card and lost Thats not a big deal They
had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they 
just were not prepared for wuite this situation Who could be

If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps
be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed
in the same way As it is I can't say that I would not have made the
same mistake Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in
for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it Maybee I would
because with all those press about its very difficult not to try
the macho stuff


The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access
to They may have calculated that the BD followers resolve was
cracking based on their listening devices within the compound They
knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt This
may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have 
been a weapon for breaking his resolve Again in Panama they had used
the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion Funny that
few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the
death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted
to arrest their former ally


And please let's not turn this into a progun vs antigun
discussion  Antigun people do not believe that gunowners
deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government
agents  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his
guns were legal illegal illegalbutshouldhavebeenlegal
or whatever 

Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired
on the police helicopter No matter whether the warrant was or
was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out 
thought that it was Thus the assault on them was completely
inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to
employ

Of course we have to consider the guns issue That is the whole
core of the question Everything else is a diversion

There is something terribly wrong however with a culture which
condemns attacks and all too often kills any of its members who
attempt to get an education  My mother is an elementary school
teacher and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
hisher peers of trying to be white and is beaten bullied and
tormented by them  It goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
a beating  In my mother's school one of the most promising young
students who happened to be african american had her throat cut by
one of these young thugs

You know you have a point here but don't stop with African Americans
When I was in high school in the early s on various occasions I had
knives pulled on me had friends who were stabbed and I was beaten up
repeatedly by those that couldn't accept me as different  And don't
let the teachers off the hook either  On many many occasions there
were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their
wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they
would just watch quietly  All of this was in a nice white middle
class high school  In fact we were so nice and white that we made
sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom
with his white girlfriend  This isn't a race thing it's the
way public schools seem to be run

I'd hate to be in high school right now  At least I didn't have
to deal with guns just the roving psychodrugdorks and the jocks
withoutafuturebutwithplentyoftestosterone

I'd separate everyone who wants to learn from these assholes  But hey
the valuelessness of learning and glorification of jocks is an American
tradition you think anything is going to change  If you have kids
take 'em out of the public school system and educate them yourself
That's what I'll do if I ever have them  I wouldn't wish what I went
through upon any kid  Maybe on some of their parents though

 c Constitution worshiping It's right because it's in the
 constitution As if the constitution wasn't framed by men centuries
 ago in a totally different world

We have three options with respect to the Constitution

 Abide by it
 Duly amend it
 Abandon those parts of which a majority disapproves

Of course since the whole point of the Constitution is to restrain the
will of the majority and since even in unfettered democracy we have 
nothing to fear from minorities  amounts to abandoning the 
Constitution altogether

Which will it be

 	Actually I was rather surprised to see an article on this subject
 ie the new inproved survey saying that roughly  of men are gay
 on the front page of The New York Times recently I think it was
 on Thurs  April  The headline was something to the effect of 
 New Survey Finds  of Men Are Gay
 
 	I was shocked not because the New York Times was running a story
 on a sex survey although that was part of it but because they thought
 that this news was actually important enough to warrant front page space
 I mean how many people actually CARE how many people are gay as long as
 you know how to findavoid them if you want to  I don't  

If you don't care why was so much effort put into promoting the
 lie  Because it was important to scare politicians into
obedience

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

        The BATF in a letter they've been sending out to people
says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of
surprise and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it
slammed in their faces

        It strikes me as kind of strange to rely on surprise to
serve a warrant by knocking on the door

Presumably the BD did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen
ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell

Once inside the building the BATF would have been in control Trained
police officers are a match to any bunch of Bozos playing at soldiers


Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

        Phill the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for fortyfive
minutes  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they wouldn't have shown up in livestock trailers and would
have retreated immediately

Not a smart move Unless meant to be part of the surprize cover Even so
the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea A side opening
truck would have been much better more like a covered waggon


        If they were expecting peacful citizens why show up with over
a hundred officers some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying 
submachineguns and  National Guard Helicopters

Sounds just about right to me Its the minimum amount of force that I
would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talkpoliticsguns
annual dinner

Michael Hesseltine ordered the use of over  crack troops including
members of the parachute regiment to remove approx  hippy peace
protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles He
even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings Just about the
most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener That single
action probably cost him the position as Prime Minister One of the elders
of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of Toryism
Hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke

Wait a second you're ignoring major facts here

There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant The BATF had a
noknock warrant The initial firefight began when the BATF threw
concussion grenades at the building BATF admits this

	When did the BATF say this Everything I've seen from the BATF
	from the official version to the dissident statements of BATF
	officers who conducted the raid claims that the Davidians were
	shooting at the agents long before they were within grenade 
	range 

	Also if the warrant is sealed how do we know it was a 'noknock'  

Hey don't confuse these guys with facts dude You might break some
beautiful illusions

Of course by BATF admits this they mean that the BATF did not deny some
post by a proKoreshgun lobby person some time back

If anyone wants to understand the paranoid mindset of Koresh I offer you
talkpoliticsguns There you can dredge the sewers of minds so hung
up on power and ego trips that they bend reality arround their own
particular set of beleifs

I long ago gave up arguing the case for arms control directly Instead
I invite people to ask themselves would you want to be in a room full

  Gee Jim if you'll check the Constitution you'll find in order to
  promote the general welfaredo ordain and establish this Constitution
  I'm surprised you missed it  It's right there in the first paragraph  I
  would have thought you would have made it at least through the preamble

 You almost got it right and it was a good try but you should follow your
 own advice  The PREAMBLE to the CONSTITUTION does read as you have quoted
 but let us not forget that after all it is only the preamble  It is not
 a binding part of the Constitution and carries no weight in the law  That 
 poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages 
 in the English language  witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who
 think those vague flowery phrases are part of the law of the land  Do you
 really believe that a politician only has to give lip service to promoting
 the general welfare to be within the limits of the constitution

 Sorry buddy but some other blowhards managed to include the general
 welfare in another portion of the constitution

 Article I Section  The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect
 taxesto pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL
 WELFARE of the United States

 I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
 said in the preamble

 But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
 in Article I Section  I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
 functions  Right

    James Madison Federalist Paper 

    It has been urged and echoed that the power to lay and
     collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts
     and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the
     United States'' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise
     every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common
     defense or general welfare

    No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which
     these writers labor for objections than their stooping to such a
     misconstruction  Had no other enumeration or definition of the
     powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution than the
     general expressions just cited the authors of the objection
     might have had some color for it   But what color can the
     objection have when a specification of the objects alluded to by
     these general terms immediately follows and is not even
     separated by a longer pause than a semicolon    Nothing is
     more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and
     then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars

In article rlINNhctronnewsctroncom smithctroncom Lawrence C Smith writes

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

This is stupid  That is no paranoid assertion it is testamony from surviving
witnesses and the BATF has no tanks nor am I aware of either the BATF or
the FBI using any until yesterday  When they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed

These surviving witnesses being members of which cult pray tell 


The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 

Underarmed  You flabberghast me they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bulletproof vests  They were using concussion
grenades and fullauto weapons what was missing lowyield tacnukes  This
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used both initially and yesterday  You should be ashamed

We were having a discussion about whether Bush would have done anything
differently On the basis of Panama Grenada Tripoli Kewait etc we 
decided that Bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike  or used a 
cruise missile some people suggested that he would have used the nuke
warhead cruise others pointed out that he would be too cheap to use 'em

What was missing Armoured vehicles 


If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it

They had a surefire method keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looneytune religious
stunt

Phil I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you
will back anything no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone
else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like  It's people
with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust a process
that is in place now in this country even if the tattered pitiful remains
of the Constitution is slowing its progress  This isn't a Libertarian issue
others may argue that line but from a strictly Constitutional view of a
democratic gov't what the FBI and BATF did was wrong wrong wrong even if
their reasons for trying to arrest Koresh were  right  Anything that
leads to the deaths of  children if nothing else touches your stoney
heart is wrong no matter who pushed the button  For God's sake man get
your morality back

The person who murdered  children was Koresh He kept them there and 
brought about their deaths deliberately

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap
Thats quite true I don't pretend to be Being nice is what amateurs
try to do If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children Anyone who has held the office of President
of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA
or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear 
Holocaust in order to protect freedom Beleive it or not that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make Do they have a gun nutters
section of the US version of CND by any chance


There are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as Koresh or Hitler If it were not for the consideration
of the  children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance It is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide

The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire If proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero


I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse

Thankfully you got the gender right  For I am not a deviant

 how disparaging you are towards political minorities

Sexual deviants do not comprise a political minority

 and if she had any shred of selfrespect she'd be out the door

I only associate with girls who do indeed have selfrespect  But were
I to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the
door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as
homosexuality I would encourage her to indeed do so and I would
further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on
the way out  Who needs such an airhead

 Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
 where they belong

 Don't count on it sweetheart

Oh I can't do anything BUT count on it  After all it is
inevitable for it is part of the natural order of things  Throughout
history nature has always asserted itself  Don't be so arrogant as
to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the

In a previous article mechalasgnecnpurdueedu John P Mechalas says

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans  This may not even be an
accurate statement anyway since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information  We'll have to wait

Yeah we may have to wait till hell freezes over If they had listening
devices in place one would think they would have audiotapes as a result
Why when officials are asked about what those devices picked up do they
stumble around and never answer the question If they have them I think 
people have a right to hear the tapes 

   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say  Their credibility
is shot anyway since they origianlly said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover  We saw how accurate that was

I don't contend that Koresh wasn't a liar That's not really the issue
The issue is did the federal agents use the most prudent measures available
in ending this fiasco that in my opinion was bungled from the
very beginning

   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

I don't know and neither do you unless you were there who started the
fire I hope we find out but I have my doubts

   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves  

Could you please show us this evidence that you have Right now a lot
of people on all sides of this issue are making conflicting statements
right and left Some real live evidence would be most welcome

You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people  All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

In my opinion it is possible that the actions of the FBI a indirectly
b directly but not intentionally or c intentionally I hope not the
latter but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely caused
the fire It is possible that someone inside the community started
the fire because they thought God told them to or because they simply
would rather die than surrender Who knows 

We are left with some compelling questions here besides the above Why
haven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not they
heard shots coming from within the compound once the tank I don't
remember its technical name started ramming down the door It seems
to me that gunshots would be audible at  to  miles away

Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript as they
had promised they would Does the fact that Koresh lied justify the
FBI's lying as well

Will an internal investigation really reveal what happened if in fact
the BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame

How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in the
nowunsealed finally warrant Certainly we won't find out in a
court of law

There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out when
the fire started but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed the
stairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped
Only those in another part of the house escaped

People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came running
out of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather than
going back in When was the last time you had your clothes on fire Who 
the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why I think
the FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically 
btw I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the evil feds 
by any means I simply question the decisions from start to finish
that led to the horrible tragedy of yesterday

i'm not saying i'm satisfied with the outcome it's very upsetting
you are simply blaming the wrong person  


Oh are we Jill  Let me tell you a story then

One evening not long in this country a man a parolee a convicted KNOWN 
violent crimminal lead police on high speed chase after breaking another law
He decided that police had no right to do their jobs and enforce the law
and assualted two of while attempting to resist arrest  When police use
metal sticks to force him into submission we heard all the reason why certain
people in this country have and excuse when they refuse to obey the law 
how this was a perfect example of police oppression how all the police
had to do was behave a certain way and all would have been finei how nothing
the victim did could have possibly warranted the response  some blows with
a few sticks  he got from the authorities

Funny how when it's Bloodbath Billy or his hitwench calling the shots
a group of people who were bothering no one were not know to have broken 
any law who asked only that they be left alone to practice their religion
as they fit how it is now that the government is justified in assualting
those people with  heavily armed commandos simply because the gun 
grabbers in DC thought these people had more guns thay they thought they
should have  Now when it's the Clinton administration that has the blood
of dozens on its hand AAAALL of a sudden it's the people who refused to
have their civil rights violated it's their fault those evil fanatics
provoked it

How is it in the mind of the liberal DemocratClinton supporter that a
crimminal puke scum bag piece of garbage like Rodney King could not have
possibly provoked the beating he got but this bunch of wierdos could cause 
a fifty one day stand off that ended with the burning deaths of all of them
and their children all by themselves with no help from the the police  
And to here people say they deserved what they got to hear Clinton say
the blame rest solely with Koresch what a cowardly piece of work that
man has shown again himself to be

WE'RE blaming the right people  It is you and others that defend ANY of the
actions of the BATF FBI or Justice Department in this matter that with 
each word prove again and again the depth of the hypocrisy the double
standard that people like the Clintons would hold certain Americans to 
While at the same time allowing others to do as they please with only 
excuses to offer their victims  It's all to clear these days from the
comments of the president and the rationalizations of his supporters
in these groups that in a liberal Democratic vision of America only
a certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced 
and this administration intends to enforce laws apply the Constitution
and obey the laws only when it suits them to do so

 Michael A Thomas writes

 As far as set the moral tone is concerned if a community does not
 collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of their
 kids why should they have to  If a community does not want to see
 proliferation of drugs among their kids why should they have to

  By what right And do tell from the standpoint of the drug
dealer or prostitute what is the difference if the gun is pointed
by the local hick city council or the feds
  If something is wrong it is wrong Period If it is not
sustainable at a federal level why should it be OK just because
the geographical unit is smaller


Peter Nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in 
talkpoliticsmisc so I need not consume more bandwidth here



 The problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the
 fundamental dilemma of democratic government  The People have a right
 to exercise a voice in their community yet individuals have the right
 to be left to themselves  This is a serious dilemma precisely because
 there is not much that takes place in a vacuum

  You are seriously misusing the word egalitarian You should
look the word up before you use it There is a vast difference
between Equal Justice under the Law and Egalitarianism

What I meant if it was not clear was the intersection set of liberal
and libertarian philosophies of natural rights and how the government
and Constitutional interpretation in particular fits into that 
philosophy  This philosophy engages in the very serious practical 
error of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost 
totalitarian authority completely outside of the consent or consensus 
of The People  This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing
political fistfights these days because He who Controls the Court
Rules the Country  The people on the Court may well be trying to do
the best job they can but they are at best a benevolent oligarch even
if you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever  Eventually an
oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear  Try 
Supreme Court cases by Jury and the problem would be mitigated a great 
deal

Those who would create broad nonenumerated government powers at any 
level as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current defacto
standard in the US have essentially engaged in the same fundamental 
mistake except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian 
virtually unchecked except by plurality election death or retirement 
government power 


  And why should your community be allowed to stop my activities
when I'm not picking your pocket or defrauding you Just because
you don't like it Because you find it morally repugnant 

This is like asking why the wind blows unless you can prove that
the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no 
effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to
your engagement in those activities  Very few human activities indeed
fit into this category  

Even for those few that do who would you empower to make the judgement 
of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity  Who defines picking 
my pocket and defrauding  Are economic assets a person's only assets
or are peace of mind stability confidence in a child's emotional 
environment security and many other things not also a part of a person's
assets  What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a
parent strongly objects to  What gives you the right to create an 
environment of social unrest and instability  If you say that what you
do does not have those effects by what authority do you say that  Who
is empowered to make these value judgements


How 
would you feel if I got a gang together and found xtianity
or insert your favorite cause here morally repugnant and
passed laws to outlaw its free exercise all at a local
level since that seems to be AOK with you


If the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so the 
federal government would prevent you from doing so  If it did not and
you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local
Constitution by say a  majority empowering the local government 
to do so then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood
more friendly to my own system of values  This is not an ideal situation
but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now


 As to the gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends there are very
 few restrictive local laws that I personally would advocate or vote for
 since I am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors
 should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary  But
 I DO believe in protecting children from victimization by people who have
 callous disregard for the effects they have on others  I would certainly
 leave a wellbehaved massage parlor alone so long as it had no
 detrimental effects on the neighborhood

  You just don't get it The debate is not whether you or a
communitity would or would not vote away my rights it is
the propriety of whether that should even be an option

When you define rights very broadly there is no practical choice about 
whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these
rights overlap  Even when rights are defined very narrowly the government 
has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights  The 
fundamental question is by whose authority is that power created  If you 
support the current situation with a natural rights Supreme Court rather
than an original understanding Supreme Court or even better Supreme
Court by Jury you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington 
DC create those powers out of the air  In my Fractal Federalism scenario 
it is a broad consensus of The People ie the amendment process that 
creates those powers


 Certainly not the only cause Mike but people in a local neighborhood
 should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood  To deny this
 is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality
 from abusing its power

   You mean that horrific centralized power the individual

No I mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to
tell the locals how to run their neighborhood  Waco TX is a nice example



 in essence using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle
 from biting your leg  Chances are the pit bull is going to turn on you
 some day and you have much less defense against it than you do against
 the toy poodle  Ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and
 no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary  This will
 never work because people are different and by their nature they will
 always want to force their views on others  If this were not the case
 nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else

  Fine When they force their views on others prosecute them
Until then leave them alone This is such a simple concept
How do you feel about speech codes Hate speech certainly
could be considered an indication that the pit bull is
going to turn some day Should the community be allowed
to limit it too If not why not

If you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the 
cause of personal autonomy have you done anything different  What
precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to  If you
list them perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly
autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them



  And how do you feel about David Koresh Did he deserve
it Should the BATF or a local version of same be allowed
to toss him in jail just because they think he's off
his rocker

The Koresh Incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power
power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means I would abolish 
The constitutionality of noknock warrants seems very dubious to me not
to mention the mere existence of BATF and the government's propensity to 
ignore the word infringe in the Second Amendment  This power is upheld 
by the same body with its incredible concentration of power in the hands 
of nine people that has upheld much socalled Civil Rights read affirmative 
action legislation despite the Fourteenth Amendment



   Who said anything about the public till Get rid of it and
 get out of my face
 

 I agree about getting rid of the public till  Are you still sure you don't
 want to come over for coffee  You might not especially like my neighborhood
 and I might not especially like yours but at least we can agree to let each
 other live the kind of life we want to

  At the point you get rid of the public till you lose all
credibility as to why you should have a say about my private
affairs Are you sure you are ready for that


Money is certainly not the only asset I have in this world  If it were
this would be a bleak existence indeed

    Yes so  You still haven't explained why they

     Male sex survey Gay activity low
 
     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American men's sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
      percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual
 
     The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
     the  percent figure that has been part of the conventional
     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report
 
  So what

Homosexuals lie about the  number to hide the disproportionate
involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  

Put up or shut up Where is your evidence
Show a study indicating a link between liking GROWN UPS of the same
sex and liking children Saying that  of molested children are male
shows nothing since it tells you nothing of the molesters preference
in adults if they have any at all 

They also lie
about  to keep politicians scared

The politicians will have plenty to be scared of in one week be it  or


  It will be interesting to see the reaction when million queers
    gather in Washington DC After all if there are only million of
    us then this is an event unprecidented in history

But many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals but
other members of the leftist agenda

I'm sure there will be a few non queers but the vast majority are
queer

  Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
  better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months
 
 	Firstly they could have backed off
 
 Regardless of who was at fault in the first assault the one in which
 four ATF officers died once that was over backing off was no longer
 an option  The people inside particularly Koresh were criminal
 suspects  They could have made a case of selfdefense if they wanted
 in a court of law  Until then the police had the responsibility to
 capture and arrest them  I've never heard of a case where the police
 knew there was a criminal suspect in a building and still decided
 to back off  Continuing the siege was one of the few alternatives
 to what actually took place and it's a matter of debate whether any
 of these would have ended any better
 

How about letting in the press

How about letting Koresh out to talk to the press

Maybe if he had been allowed to talk with the pressTV for a couple of
days he would have surrendered peacefully


How about letting the relatives of Koreshs followers talk


Seems to me when you isolate someone try to send them crazy by playing
loudspeakers through the night of Tibetan chants etc you dont have
much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy  Im not too
sure of their sanity to start with

I am VERY suspicious when the government controls all communication
and sends the press  miles away 
I have a gut feeling that noknock warrant which is sealed would not
stand up to scrutiny

I dont think noknock warrants are what the constitution writers had
in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure
I dont think an allpowerful central hightaxing government was
what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights
to the citizens and states and restricted central government

Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people

Excuse me  WHO destroyed the BD's  Last I knew they burned themselves

   Where did you get this information  The FBI stated they were not
   aware of any mass suicide plans ditto Koresh's attorneys who appeared
   on Larry King's Live yesterday and the survivors claim the fire was started
   from the outside

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans  

    That means that BD's had no plans to commit suecide

                                                        This may not even be an
accurate statement anyway since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information  We'll have to wait

    Are you saying the FBI may have actually received information that BD's were 
    going to burn themselves alive and did not stop the assault  Even if that
    were true you gotta be kidding if you expect them to release that kind of 
    information to the public

   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say  Their credibility
is shot anyway since they origianlly said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover  We saw how accurate that was

    That's not what Koresh's attorney said on Larry King's Live He said
    that Koresh was not going to come out before the Passover and that he and
    his leutenant were working day and night on some kind of religious
    manuscript something about the Seven Seals and that once they finished
    they would come out  K's attorney also said that the day before the
    assault an armored vehicle delivered typewriter supplies to the compound
    and that the FBI promised many times there would not be another attack
    that the matters would be resolved peacefully

   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  

    No they meant that BD's did not set the place on fire

Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

    That was the initial claim but I do not believe it has been repeated
    since  Anyway I'd like to see a tape  The FBI surely videotaped
    the whole operation All conversations must have been recorded too

    How come the two were not shot by the FBI snipers


   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves 

    What evidence

 You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people   All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

    That is what the survivors claim  I'd like to see some evidence
    that people that everyone agrees were not going to commit suecide
    actually did it

Hang on you missed the point entirely they are protesting the lack of
water because it DEPRIVED Koresh of his CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to prove
his DIVINITY by WALKING on it


and the FBIATF go blasting holes into the builing and firing gas munitions

They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

You can tell that the gas did not burn because dispite the fact that
the building was full of it there was no flash of gas flame

gldcunixbcccolumbiaedu Gary L Dare writes
 
I heard about a guy in Alberta who came down with some rare eye 
disease that he had to take repeated trips to Seattle to get treated
 
Well what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses

Well it wasn't just the travel expenses It was the whole treatment

When you buy insurance where you live it is based on the local rates
Tourists coming from say Utah will find that there is a difference
in what their insurance will cover FOB Provo and what they get stuck
with at Lenox Hill or Mount Sinai if they fall ill in the Big Apple

But to what extent does it affect the system And why is an urgent 
care list necessary in the first place It's worth thinking about
 
It's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get
at what facilities  Don't Americans have to arrange in advance for
operations too  I think that there are two standards being applied
here and that Canada can't give Beverly Hillsstyle treatment to
everybody  It's not a big brother list  it's more like calling
around town for a table for dinner 

But Americans need far less advance time to book operations

It would depend on where you live downtown Toronto or Mile 
British Columbia just like Cheyenne WY vs Boston MA  Again
geography rears its ugly head

Since our health care providers are private they depend on an
adequate market size in order to sustain enough business  Since
our health care professionals have equivalent takehome pay to 
their American cousins it's not that they're being paid too
little to provide services

whether Canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own 
health services catering toward Americans who would be willing 
to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be 
noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants 
from the province were getting smaller If those grants are so 
insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the 
difference
 
You answered the question yourself  private nonprofit foundations
have to make money somehow and I think that it's about time that
they acted like the private hospitals that they are  Personally
I'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that
their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance
that's one at you Bob Rae

True but I was thinkingDoescan anybody compete with the provinces
to offer basic health coverage I remember reading that that sort of 
private health insurance is actually illegal in Canada 

I have only hear Americans say that it's illegal  but I could be
wrong just have never heard it from a Canadian source  our private
insurance has recently balked in Quebec when the Liberals proposed
privatizing some aspects of routine care  also our insurance was
put in place when no NDP Labour governments were in power in any
province to derail the effort 'cos they wanted real socialized
medicine

You're not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one 
insurance plan

No it is optional  as it is optional for doctors to accept it
There are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for
exemptions and one email from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton
verified for me that it is indeed negative option  I guess that you
can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but
so far I've not come across that up north  and I take pains to keep
tabs with news from home

And that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an
effective cartelthey don't really need to compete because as you put
it they're in a winwin situation and they're guaranteed to turn a
profit 

Believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out  And
according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to
the point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce luncheons

Interesting side notehave any new insurance companies started
upfrom scratchsince Medicare became standard in Canada

I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I 
no scratch that  there are a few in Western Canada and quite 
a few in Quebec as part of the post Quebec Miracle out with the
nationalism in with the French capitalism  La Groupe des Cooper
antes built a new tower by the Eaton's store at Les Terraces and if
you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as
the welllit one with doubleturrets at the top  As for Ontario
which still dominates and anchors business up north 

Canada is a very oldmoney kind of place and the  Free Trade
Agreement saw a lot of odd alliances labour unions and establishment
old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one
side and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and
professionals on the other  The final Trudeau administration and
the first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux
riches who knew what it was like to make your own money and that
motivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's
initiative Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count
of his caucus after the  election

It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives

Well you have to realize that in our society that's like saying
that it's not really national defence because you can't hire
your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist
BTW there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their
portion of taxes but never people arguing over health insurance
alternatives  and we're talking about a press that is hostile
to whomever is in government regardless of party one of their
few redeeming characteristics it seems 

Also in the April  Globe and Mail there was a letter from the
director of trauma services at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto
responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in
California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that
American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada
rationed vital services The doctor I can't recall his name said
that Canada is rationing vital services as any physician can
plainly see He said that a system in which people are refused
treatment because they can't afford it is no different from a system
in which people are refused treatment because the government can't
afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health
insurance plan In fairness he did say that both the US and 
Canadian systems are in the same situation

The only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of
high demand which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight
fist on the licencing  An obvious difference is that in such a
transient period the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling
over Cabbage Patch DollsTM as we've seen recently as opposed by
rationing by ability to pay  but the former is a transient
situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the
California health infrastructure the same would result  rationing
among the insured population  With smaller markets there is much
less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than
California which by the way has rd more people than Canada in a
MUCH more dense area  So he is correct in that the resources are
fixed for a particular time window or as a function of the doctors
monopoly licencing according to the market steady state in either
case  As for being refused treatment the government of the day
would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen
Canadians can be geographically bad too not realizing that their
health care is private while only their insurance isn't  too many
people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized
medicine

I know I know the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads
them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more
money from the government another case of businessmen once
scratched becoming socialists  

Right as I've pointed out above 

But hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place
to the other It hasn't really solved it

Either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the
changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower
rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of
disasters eg Chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart
disease A doctor needs  years of training plus internship 
and specialty training

People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their 
insurance when they really don't need to

That's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than
education which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are
arguing for the leftists  Ah just let 'em spend  yeah
right  Also note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions
under some high dollar threshold  in most it's your private
insurance that covers it just like in the US  Still it all
adds up in the OECD measures

In fact Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people
get Don Cherry jokes 

We get the Sabres' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight the
Devils' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game

The NDP cleaning up a Tory spending mess And just when I thought 
I understood Canadian politics

Yeah it's a sad story and Saskatchewan Tory leader Grant Devine
has been on a nonstop PR campaign to save his sorry butt  The
Sask NDP have taken a neoconservative turn like Hawke Gonzalez
and Mitterand did

has anybody considered following Singapore's example and going to a
system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic
coverage for everybody and then you also have an IRA sort of thing
to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical
expenses only It would tend to discourage you from overusing it

The medical IRA would have limited use as you'd need a lower
catastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the public
purse if someone exhausts their IRA  Also Singapore has a much
more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses
if Singaporeans that I've met are any indication  I don't
mean any disprespect here where they'd let you just die

One of the good things about being the last country to create a
national health care system should we decide to is that we have
everybody else's mistakes to learn from

That's true  the question is how much leeway is there between
the US approach and the secondmost capitalist approaches of
Canada France and Germany

Seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a
twomoretiered system like what the French have  a health policy
prof DG Shea has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having
a population of  is necessary for adequate competition 
and in Canada there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes
with that population or larger

But there are many cities in the US with that kind of population 

Yes many  and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too
far from a bigger town  Just take a look at a detailed atlas 
or better take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto
My first time across Lake Ontario to NYC I was amazed by the
increase in density  and the Toronto region is the densest 
in all of Canada

There was one about a group of doctors in Calgary who have opened
Canada's first USstyle MRI clinic as an alternative to the
provincially owned one

It's about time  I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they
don't invest in their own private practices  in the end it's their
money  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams and
that's none of my business  As for provincially owned  for sure
it's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved
in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser
vations  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by
on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use  no kidding
Medical practice itself is much more conservative up north  My own
best friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN
and is no stranger to high tech medicine  but his boat comes first

There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of
twotiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act

No it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have
private practices  and always have  They can all take cash
anyways  so why not have a particular facility  The Canadian
big government mentality often imagines government where it does
not even exist 

Since the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less
laidback without sacrificing their culture and values then Canadians
can do the same  As I've pointed out above the law states that it is
illegal for the government to provide any health services except for
the military and natives

Look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI 
nobody stopped them when they bought it  Nobody seems to be stopping
them from using it either  Much ado about nothing  Thank goodness
that hockey playoffs have started 

While it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by
the head of the partnership to demonstrate the MRI He showed an
image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of
the bank who approved the loan He said that without it the guy
might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial MRI then
another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would
have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder 
If that isn't the first whiff of two tiers I don't know what is

I'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the GAO study
of Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a
problem  I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened 
to American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit
There are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without
relying on MRI  unfortunately I've had a few   And I'm not
a banker

        Come out with your hands up  This matter is NOW OVER 

      Now I hear Ricks  and REno  claiming that this was just 
      another incremental step in pressure  More bullshit

      Why did they pick  AM  Monday morning  So nobody would
      NOTICE  So everyone would be busy at work starting a new
      week  More bullshit

      Did the FBI hold back fire engines  Here let me paraphrase
      Sessions

        no we didn't hold back the engines  We had them on 
         standby blah balh blah   And so to protect the
         the fireman we didn't allow the engines to enter until
         it was safe 

     WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS    YES WE HAVE NO BANANAS 

     What the HELL kind of doubletalk is this  No we didn't so
     blah balh we did    Huh

     I WATCHED this

     Clinton takes responsibility EVEN THOUGH it wasn't his 
     decision  MOre BULLSHIT  Does he or does he NOT take
     responsibility   No more even though bullshit  Yes
     Or no

Janet Reno killed the Waco children  She is responsible for
their deaths  She should resign immediately  She should have 
understood that David Koresh was a madman who would do anything
against the children if he became provoked  All the warning 
signs were there and she ignored them  She provoked Koresh
into killing the children

Aside from the fact that i disagree w you she did offer to resign and the
president rejected the offer  She was willing to take responsibility and
the president has the balls enough to stand by a decision

The fact that Reno is actually taking responsibility geethat's a new
one for a politician is a new thing for a member of Clinton's administration
I actually respect her for having a backbone  I never thought I'd say
that about someone from that bunch

The way I understand what happened is that she discussed with Clinton
what was being planned for Waco  Clinton didn't say no so gave de
facto approval for the operation  Things got messed up and a lot of
people died horrible deaths  if I am incorrect about this please 
feel free to correct it  This is just what I've been able to pick 
up

I've just got a couple of questions about this whole thing
  Why did the government feel they needed to assault that compound
  Why didn't they try to flush them out in the first week of
     this fiasco instead of waiting  days
  Janet Reno jumped up to take responsibilty to take heat away
     from the President  Does this sound anything like what a couple
     of Reagan's aides did

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare

You're smoking something not legal in the US  They never rang the

As to the good reason the BATF has the warrant and supporting

the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

        The BATF in a letter they've been sending out to people
says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of
surprise and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it
slammed in their faces

        It strikes me as kind of strange to rely on surprise to
serve a warrant by knocking on the door

Presumably the BD did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen
ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell

       Let's try that again  Why was the BATF concerned about surprise
when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door  The
BATF appears to be inconsistant in their own description of events

       And in any case how does one mount an ambush if one isn't
on alert

Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

        Phill the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for fortyfive
minutes  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they wouldn't have shown up in livestock trailers and would
have retreated immediately

Not a smart move Unless meant to be part of the surprize cover Even so
the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea A side opening
truck would have been much better more like a covered waggon

       So were the BATF fired on before or after they left the trailers
to knock on the door to serve the warrant  Every description I've
heard indicates the BATF did not hang around in the trailers once
they decided to open them up

       For that matter if they expect peaceful citizens why come in live
stock trailers to being with

        If they were expecting peacful citizens why show up with over
a hundred officers some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying 
submachineguns and  National Guard Helicopters

Sounds just about right to me Its the minimum amount of force that I
would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talkpoliticsguns
annual dinner

       Ok just to make sure we've got this straight  You consider
armed troops in disguised vehicles and multiple helicopters to be
used to serve search warrants on peaceful citizens  And just so
we don't have one of those entertaining shifts you described them
as the BATF expecting them to be peaceful

Michael Hesseltine ordered the use of over  crack troops including
members of the parachute regiment to remove approx  hippy peace
protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles He
even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings Just about the
most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener That single
action probably cost him the position as Prime Minister One of the elders
of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of Toryism
Hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke

       I don't see how past abuses excuse present ones  Hell you're
not even discussing the same government

because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the
Israeli ecconomy any more There is no money for such an occupation


Don't fool yourself It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else



Phill HallamBaker 

Oh why do you expose your ignorance  The US has been running on debt for 
the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases

The US unlike Israel has massive capital assets to wit fort Knox for 
one The accumulated assets of the British empire shiped over in bulk 
to pay for our weapons bill in world war I Or maybe you thought that the
US occupied the Boer republic that is now South Africa


And after the Gulf War Israel could do whatever it wanted after
not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks  It was encouraged but
by no means forced to negotiate

Not with Bush at the helm The gulf war meant that the middle east
was no longer a fringe issue of US politics The US people had to
be convinced that the US could keep everything hunky dory in that
region

You realise of course that all this is purely in the interests of allowing
the US citizen to drive arround in a  litre car doing single digit
miles to the gallon Were the US to act responsibly they cvould be
self sufficient in oil


Mr Baker to address all of your points would be impossible but in a 
nutshell it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in
Lebanon without attacking Syria  Syrian occupation has been hostile
and amounts to annexation 

Syrian occupation ended the civil war Israeli invasion worstened it

Its a bit like the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia reprehensible but 
it put an end to the far worse attrocity that preceeded it Now Syria
is in the US camp there might even be a possibility of some sort of
democratisation

What do you expect from an ex French colony They made a pigs ear of
every single one The British cocked up Palestine and Pakistan most
of the others managed to avoid a bloodbath Compared to Algeria Syria
had it easy


 Israel's is clearly defensive  If it 

Clearly offensive in that the original intent was to disloge the PLO from
Lebanon In the process the civil war was dramatically worsened


were not defensive you would see all of Lebanon occupied and governed by
Israel  But that is not what Israel wants

Not at all Israel is not in Lebanon because to do that would have meant
tens of thousands of dead Had the US not stopped the Likud nutters from
continuing they would have seriously have threatened Israels survival
Even in New York there was a massive feeling of revulsion for the Israeli
invasion It was a complete disaster in PR terms

I'm going to be mixing together here stuff from two of Ted Frank's
articles Aprmidwayuchicagoedu which was a
response to me and Aprmidwayuchicagoedu a
response to Tim Smith

  Yes I know the Boomer court didn't call it eminent domain  But
  if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and
  quacks like eminent domain  wdstarr

 Are all tort cases really eminent domain cases then  What about
 bankruptcy  Contract

Eminent domain is a statemandated transaction in which one party is
required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party
regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all at a price
which is set by the state  I fail to see how this doctrine can be found
in tort bankruptcy or contract cases in general  Well okay sort of
in bankruptcy

        

 If so so what  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
 business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements
 from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts
 by those other parties  wdstarr

 Since you said that Boomer's reliance on economics led to an unjust
 result  I'm pointing out that your alternative is far more unjust in
 the traditional sense of the world

 Atlantic Cement's act was not wrongful  It did something that we as
 a capitalistic society should want them to do build a factory create
 industry and jobs  The cost of compliance was grossly
 disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs

Bang  Here's one of the places where we widely diverge  You believe
that the courts in deciding a civil dispute between two parties should
consider as a factor  perhaps as an overriding factor  issues which
I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute
Boomer v  Atlantic Cement Co was an action brought by one party
Boomer whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by
another party the Atlantic Cement Company  The facts supported
Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his
property and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop
doing so  End of story  There was no reason for the court to consider
such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to
do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage
faced by the plaintiffs  Those issues had nothing to do with the case
before the court

 Bill if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation
 requiring multimillion dollar cement plants to be shut down because
 of a smattering of cement dust at a costbenefit ratio of 
 you'd be up in arms  Why is it okay for the judicial branch to
 interfere this way but not the legislative or executive branches

I'd be up in arms  Why do you assume that  Quite the contrary I'd
probably support the action since it would be based on the same general
doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in
Boomer the idea that people's property rights should not be violated
for reasons of economic efficiency  In Boomer it was Boomer's
property rights which I believe the court should have protected in the
hypothetical EPA ruling you've presented it's the American people's
collective property rights in a healthy physical environment  What
good is costbenefit ratio of  if you wind up with cement dust in
your air

        

 Your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant
 If the State of Massachusetts came up with a similar regulation
 you'd be up in arms and complaining about interference with
 property rights and Fifth Amendment violations  Once againwhy
 is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way but not
 the legislative or executive branches  Or are you not the
 libertarian you present yourself as being  Ted Frank

 How would it be per se illegal to operate a cement plant  Wouldn't
 it just mean that when buying land for a cement plant you would
 have to either buy enough land so that most of the pollution would
 stay on your land or buy pollution easements from the surrounding
 landowners  Tim Smith

 All it takes is one holdout out of hundreds of neighbors to scrap the
 plant  Furthermore each of the neighbors is going to want the full
 benefit of the bargain under the resulting bilateral monopoly  A
 bonanza for lawyers to be sure who get to negotiate each of these
 agreements a windfall for homeowners who can extort away any profits
 the plant would make but not particularly good for society

Yes  So what  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights
of individuals not the general interests of some nebulous society  If
society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights
fine  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less
cement plant  See Ted I really am a libertarian after all 

 That's the whole point behind the Coase Theorem  In a world without
 transactions costs the land will automatically be put to the best
 use as it is transferred from person to person instantaneously
 without friction the legal regime will not matter because the result
 will be the same  In a world such as ours one with transactions
 costs one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to
 begin with in order to minimize the transactions costs

One wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with
in order to minimize the transactions costs  Which one are you
speaking of  I want the legal regime to protect people's rights
Besides Coase's Theorem only has real application in the nevernever
land of perfectly rational actors  In the real world  some people
are going to be stubborn ornery spiteful or otherwise irrational
from a economic point of view and  the purpose of the courts is to
protect their right to be so  I don't care if you can show me logically
that your cattle are only doing  of damage to my property per head
so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for say 
per head  I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't
want any damned cattle on my property not at any price

            

 And then you say Everyone's property rights were protected the
 plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were
 avoided  As above I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were
 made whole  They were in fact by court action deprived of their
 rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that
 property at a price acceptable to them  wdstarr

 Then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because
 the award of damages in involuntary  Why should we treat a nuisance
 plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff  We don't
 require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation
 why in tort

Last question first For the same reason as in contract law  because
to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth
Amendment

As to your Then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made
whole because the award of damages in involuntary claim you're at
least partially right  Faced with situations in which the wrong has
already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place
and cannot be reversed or undone courts will try to set an equitable
price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer
to pay this price rather than an inflated price which the victim might
prefer  In these cases the sale has already taken place and is
irreversible and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is
paid under the doctrines that a only in certain circumstances should
even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and
b even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or
inequitable manner from his victimhood  Both of these doctrines may be
worth discussing or debating elsewhere but neither is relevant to cases
like Boomer in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it
are still in the future and can be reversedundone ie prevented
from happening at all by order of the court

In these types of cases all the court has to do is require that the
potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he
agrees to sell them at a mutuallyacceptable price  There is no need
for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both
sides to accept its finding  It can leave that operation up to the
parties themselves

 And again I ask Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
 business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided
 If so I've been miseducated  I always thought that the courts were
 supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done

 Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive

In cases like Boomer they're simply a cost of doing business  The
fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co got themselves into
a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a
result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant
without first trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose
property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant
There's nothing punitive or unjust about it

  It is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged
 right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid
 losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and
 the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to
 not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who
 own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts
 wdstarr

 Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire
 set of possessions to wronged person  Weren't you complaining about
 excess punitive damages before

Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be
required to buy the right to do so from the victim in advance  And the
seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege  No
injustice no punitive damages

            

 You'd like Posner Bill  He's a libertarian

Really  I didn't know that what if anything has he had to say
about cases like Boomer  wdstarr

 In EAL he cites it as an example of bilateral monopoly that the court
 correctly avoided  I'm sure its covered in the Landes and Posner book
 on tort law presumably favorably but I don't have that book in front
 of me

Doesn't sound very much like a libertarian to me  Libertarians tend to
believe in the rights of individual people not societies

            

 I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred
 to as law and economics is weak  If it advocates the use of
 economical analysis as one of many tiebreaker factors which
 courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the
 dispute as measured by the scale of justice is evenly balanced
 fine  But as illustrated by Boomer it is not fine when the
 courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important
 than the justice of a case  wdstarr

 In this case the justice of the case was intricately tied up with the
 economics of the case  Atlantic Cement committed a tort causing K
 of damage  Should it pay in the millions  Or just compensate for the
 damage it committed

As stated above the tort was ongoing  Atlantic Cement wanted to be
able to continue to violate Boomer's rights  While the court may have
been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already
committed it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the
future violations of Boomer's rights and to then force Boomer to sell
at that price

Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people

Excuse me  WHO destroyed the BD's  Last I knew they burned themselves

    Where did you get this information  The FBI stated they were not
    aware of any mass suicide plans ditto Koresh's attorneys who appeared
    on Larry King's Live yesterday and the survivors claim the fire was started
    from the outside

Prove to me that the FBI ATF or the Government in general either burned
the compound themselves or that the BD's had no choice but to commit
mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully a promise that was made
twice by Koresh himself which he broke both times

  Or laws to stop companies from making lookalike FordGM car parts and
selling them as the real thing  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 's cars

Wooa there I have a classic car If I buy a body pannel for  after
being told that it is genuine BL and discover that it is a non original
copy value  I get real pissed If I can get the genuine article I will
pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit probably
meaning that its cheaper overall but it also means that the car is worth
a hell of a lot more

  What I was referring to was not fraud lookalike companies but ones that
made cheap 'GM' etc parts for restoring cars  They were sold as NONname
brand parts but had all of the 'look' so your car would be restored to true
GM and not brand XYZ  As you pointed out they're a lot cheaper so the
not as diehard restorer can afford them too  This is all from what I've
read in automotive magazines over the last few years and apparently the car
companies turned a sympathetic eye because they didn't make the parts anymore

Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for
infringing copyright on parts they don't make I find that very hard to
beleive

 No but is tell me whether or not the following scenario is realistic
 elcheapo companies make and sell 'GM' parts AS GM originals
 GM gets annoyed and lobbies for a bill to stop anyone from labelling
 parts as name brand unless they actually are or pushes for heavier
enforcement of current fraud laws
 Zealous officers raid the previously mentioned small companies mostly
because they didn't have a specific licensing agreement to make the parts
that GM no longer makes

  Pow Instant oppression  Who cares about the intent of the law  It's
the letter that everyone ends up following

There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off

  Perhaps they were remanufacturing parts but then the parts would not
really be exactly namebrand

 quote from me deleted
You should revers that attitude When your interests are threatened its
way too late You have to challenge the govt when it is attacking
someone else's interests 

 I can't say I agree with you more  Perhaps I misphrased myself in my previous
post or you misread what I was trying to say

That does not mean however that you can start calling the govt the 
equivalent of the NAZI party on the basis of an unfortunate outcome
in a hostage situation

   I don't ever remember saying something like that  I may or may not
agree with what the various bureaus did but in the end it was the BD's choice
to blow themselves up and that can never be blamed on overzealous law
enforcement

Jesus allowed himself to be killed  Many of his followers have killed
and died for thier beliefs  Sorry I don't see the difference

I think the subtle difference here is that Koresh took his own life before
he could be prosecuted  Jesus allowed himself to be captured and tried 
and was sentenced to death  That's a big difference whether you're 
Christian or not  That and the fact that the Bible goes on to say that he
arose again on the third day  Now if Koresh manages that one  
   Note that I'm not admitting to being of the religions stated abovejust

   The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms At

Sigh see what our school systems are producing  Total confusion
The original English settlers were probably the most intolerant lot
of people to ever assemble  However the Founding Fathers
Washington Jefferson Madison etc practically made it their
life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy
their great experiment a democratic republic


Pilgrim  Founding forgot the taxonomy for a mo

Jefferson etc were pretty hot on Religious freedom in part because they
were freemasons At the time freemasonry was bing pushed as a sort of
alternative to christianity which was a little out of favour amongst
the intellectuals because of the propensity for religious wars On the
continent the Masons were pretty much a way of denying the Pope's 
authority

Latter on it science came up with an alternative explanation for why
the Universe existed and the intellectual necessity of creating a
creator lessened If you don't have Darwin though Freemasonry is
probably the next best explanation as to the creation of the earth

   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside  Outside 
meaning outside the compound  

    No they meant that BD's did not set the place on fire

According to the latest of CNN reports one BD said they started the fire
themselves and one said the FBI did it  Now given the choise of two
which do you belive  It's hard to answer but add that to the latest
reports again from CNN if I remember correctly that several kersone
containers were inside the compund make me believe the first guy


Yes the FBI reported seeing two people
according to CNN reports using torches to set the compound on fire   They
were outside

    That was the initial claim but I do not believe it has been repeated
    since  Anyway I'd like to see a tape  The FBI surely videotaped
    the whole operation All conversations must have been recorded too

Me too  We'll see if it comes up  More info on the listening devices
is coming on CNN nowI can't keep up with all this  Though the FBI
says that they heard no plans of a mass suicide

    How come the two were not shot by the FBI snipers

After the initial fiasco where the ATF went in with guns blazing I seriously
doubt the American public would care much for the assassination of two 
people no matter what they were doing

   Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves 

    What evidence

See above  One BD admitted that they started the fires themselves  It's
possible he's lying but I don't see what the BD's would gain from that
It only implicates them more
   Granted it's very weak evidence and everything is going to be in
a different later on  But for now there is more evidence to suggest
that the FBI did not intentionally destroy the BD's which is what the
initial poster claimed  Again as more information becomes available
things may change

 You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the destruction of the people   All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible

    That is what the survivors claim  I'd like to see some evidence
    that people that everyone agrees were not going to commit suecide
    actually did it

I'm not sure I understand that last sentancecan you restate it

In article erwintrwacs erwintrwacsfptrwcom Harry Erwin writes
A short comment
As you may recall the early Christians were pacifists preferring to
avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner

The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city
Despite some pious legends the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
especially after centuries of political instability and terror the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology Acts is eerily familiar especially today


	Huh 

	This kind of shotgun blast deserves either to be elaborated upon
or retracted Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the
writer is referring to it should be incumbent on Mr Erwin to back up what
he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two
For example Simon Zealotes  the certain apostle having a nickname
connected to a Jewish terrorist group

	Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to
Christians made above  he is quite silent as to the fate of the Jewish
Christian Church in Jerusalem even though he took the time to
record the death of St James brother of St John On the subject of the
fate of Jesus's family including James the brother of Jesus we learn
nothing from Josephus

	Likewise Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly 
vicious people getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong in
the process But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunity
to learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor under
Domitian we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christians
in either the Histories or the Annals

	The writer's interpretation of Acts is purely subjective as
stated and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspects
of cult psychology are to be found there I can think of a thing or two 
offhand but I'd like to give Mr Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his own
knowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints

	One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday One can argue about
the initial raid but it would be worth mentioning before the facts get
lost that

	 The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	during the initial raid

	 The Branch Davidians opened fire first


   See this is what really bugs me about this whole incident and
   also about Usenet  Here we are almost two months after the original
   raid a raid witnessed by several members of the press and there is 
   STILL no agreement about the basic facts  Riggs here and others
   are claiming that the BD's shot first while others on the net claim
   that the feds did in the form of concussion grenades  

   I suggest that before ANY of you make any claims about who shot 
   first you DOCUMENT your claim with actual evidence and not just
   FOAF or he said  she said     Otherwise don't use words like
   fact above  it just makes you all look stupid


	Perhaps I don't get my news from the right sources Reading
the Washington Post practically every day I had considered the facts
I stated above to be a matter of public record and hardly in dispute
So if others on the net  and in the rest of the media as well are
claiming something else I'll be glad to entertain such claims in an
openminded manner To date this is the first I've seen of any claim 
that the BATF used ANY weapons BEFORE the Branch Davidians opened 
fire on them So  please   enlighten me

 Furthermore 
the planet is a system of carbon sulfur and other chemicals which have been

  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship
  Worship of money is one of the greatest religions in this country
 
 At least I can prove that money exists  Can you say the same for your
 god
 

I have evidence that you will not accept that proves to me that God
exists  I have my personal experiences that have proven to me time
and again that God does exist  My life has not been a bed of roses
and He has been there for me when no one else was around and pulled
me through those times  Of course I know this means nothing to you
because it didn't happen to you  I can't prove to you that God
exists anymore than you can prove that He doesn't

It ultimately boils down to faith  Whether or not you believe in
God is a matter strictly between you and Him  I am just the messenger
I don't judge and I don't condemn you for not accepting God  That is
not my place  You are not my enemy  Satan is our common enemy  And
the only way we can defeat Satan is through Jesus Christ

   Maybe David Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat
   opening epic for a new major religion to me  
  
  NOT  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world
  for a brief moment in time
 
 I see  And what was that guy two thousand years ago who thought he
 was god  Sounds like an egomanic to me  How do you know that Koresh
 wasn't who he claimed


He fulfilled the prophesies told about Him  He performed miracles
You know healing the sick and ressurrecting the dead  Jesus died
and rose from the dead just as He said He would  He preached that
we should love God and love one another as we do ourselves  Jesus
put into practice that which He preached  And He rose from the
dead  His spirit now lives in me  He changed the world not through
the use of a sword that cleaves the flesh but the Word of God that
cleaves us from sin

Compare this to DK who made promises of surrendering and then balked
when his deluded predictions didn't come to pass  In the end he 
chose to kill himself and everyone with him to hide the shame of 
being a false Messiah
 
  Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the FBI
  Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers  Sick and    sad
 
 Jesus allowed himself to be killed  Many of his followers have killed
 and died for thier beliefs  Sorry I don't see the difference


Jesus allowed himself to be killed in order to fulfill prophecy  As
you may recall on the Mount of Olives Jesus prayed to God that if this
fate could have been avoided He would have taken it  But instead
out of love for mankind Jesus chose to accept the agonizing sentence
placed upon Him and thus redeem all mankind  Jesus died to save 
everyone even those who crucifed Him  He's already gone to Hell and
back for you and for me  All He asks is your love

Which followers do you refer to  There have been many who have used
His name to further their own gains  They would have done the same
even if there was no Jesus in the first place  For example Bush 
claimed that God was on their side when they attacked Iraq and Saddam
claimed to have God on his side when he invaded Kuwait  IMO God
would have nothing to do with either side  They were fighting over
oil plain and simple
 
God be with you

FURY OF MOTHER NATURE
Clearly man has a long way to go to match nature as a despoiler of the 
environment

BULLSHIT How many lakes have ceased to be able to support life from
purely natural pollution Man has already done this to scores of lakes
Also much of the degredation you cite was done by cows and pigs

You have perhaps heard of the Dead Sea  I may be wrong but I believe
it is not misnamed  And I don't believe that humans had a hand in it
although it is possible since the great cedar forests of Lebanon were
but a memory by the time of Christ if not earlier

But more on the point while Nature is the may be the more prolific
despoiler Man is certainly the more creative  We have to our
credit pesticides and heavy metals not to mention radioactivity
which is so wonderfully persistent and fatal not that we invented
radioactivity or heavy metals we only concentrated them so that they
would be a more lethal threat

In general I find Mr Bacon's arguments rhetorical devoid of sense
and therefore trivial

BTW is there any reason this discussion is on phlmisc

So long

    Where did you get this information  The FBI stated they were not
   aware of any mass suicide plans ditto Koresh's attorneys who appeared
   on Larry King's Live yesterday and the survivors claim the fire was started
   from the outside

Actually ONE of the survivors say it was started by the FBI tank knocked over lamp  Another said the Davidians set the fire themselves

The FBI says that one survivor says they set the fire themselves

Given that the claim is that the fire was started in  places at once
and that the building was being rammed by a tank and filled with tear
gas just how did the Davidians manage to coordinate such a thing

stuff about mormons  jews deleted

And as an agnostic who's slightly aware of the Mormon Wars that Casper
describes I'd side with him on this Not that I support the Koreshians nor
                                                              
do I support the Mormons but in a nasty sense the major difference is
this in  the Mormons kicked the US Army's ass In  the
Koreshians died in an inferno Chances are if things had turned out a
 
little differently we might have Koreshians posting to the Net a hundred
                                   
years from now talking about some future analogous event

A little comment here

Please DON't use the term Koreshians when referring to the Branch Davidians
The term Koreshians is already being used  It is the name of a now nonexist
'cult' formed in the early part of this centuary by a Cyrus Reed Teed who
renamed himself 'Koresh'  He formed a religious group called the Koreshian
Unity which believed that the Earth was Hollow  WE lived on the inside  The
were formed in Chicago but left to establish their 'New Jerusalem' in Estero
Florida  The group was fairly successful but soon died out as they believed
in celebacy  The last member died about  years ago

The Koreshian were a pretty intersting group  Today their community is now
a Florida State Historical Site  A local historical group sponsors two 
festivals every year their which coinsides with the cult's two festivals

Sigh I was waiting some some notsointelligent person to bring this
up  Look this is a country of laws To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance

 th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses
 papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
 shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon
 probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons
 or things to be seized

No a noknock warrant is in clear violation of the th amendment
Okay what about the fact that they were tipped off  they shouldn't
have opened fire  right  WRONG  Think about this I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a noknock warrant So
being moronic sheep we wait with our guns holstered Now instead of
the Feds in comes my competition and we're history  The only
acceptable answer to a noknock warrant is blazing guns  I may sound
paranoid but our government is out of control and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it

I assume you are saying that noknock warrants are 'unreasonable' this
is a matter of opinion and is not a CLEAR violation of the th
admendment You say that 'this is a country of laws' yet you seem very
willing to ignore these laws or at least those you disagree with
and respond to a legal situation with 'blazing guns' Like it or not
as it stands now noknock warrants are legal If you don't like this
there are legal means to fight this including contacting your
congresspersons about changing the law and if it happens to you
fighting its legality in court

From article Aprgnecnpurdueedu by mechalasgnecnpurdueedu John P Mechalas
Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people
 
 Excuse me  WHO destroyed the BD's  Last I knew they burned themselves
 Prove to me that the FBI ATF or the Government in general either burned
 the compound themselves or that the BD's had no choice but to commit
 mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully a promise that was made
 twice by Koresh himself which he broke both times

At this point in time we don't who destroyed the BDs  Maybe it was the
government maybe it was Koresh  I wouldn't immediately rule out the
government just because the FBI said that a couple of cult members
torched Koresh's woodframe house  I think that the credibility of the
FBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best at worst they are
baldfaced liers  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that
survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their
woodframe house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the
compound to errupt in flames  Also I have heard that one of the cult
members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire
is no longer claiming that he did it  Moreover he and possibly the
other person may not have even really said that they did it in the
first placewe only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS  I'll believe it when
I hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then

The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire  They
claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
masks  Hmmm  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
agent to me  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black  Note  this
is just speculation on my part  Still it is something to think about
Here's something else to ponder upon  the two agents that were planted
in the compound might have done something to start that fire  I don't
know if they did it deliberately or notif they did at allbut I
would like to see statements from these two agents on the events that
transpired during that day  I think that they would be rather
enlightening don't you think  They were inside the compound so they
ought to have a real good idea of what went on in there  Of course if
they did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would be
very forthcoming with any information

The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in the
compound  They may have said this so that people might be more
likely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire  However
consider that if the FBI did lightup that house would they admit to
it  I think not  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue if
people discovered that the FBI killed  people  Obviously the FBI
would do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDs
started the fire  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house
fires burning in more than one location in a house isn't inconsistent
with a house fire  The tear gas cannisterswhich do produce heat
despite what you may have been told by the mediamay have contributed
to starting the blaze  Also it was very windy on the day of the
fire  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts of
the house that weren't already on fire  Like I said the verdict isn't
in yet  The FBI may very well be guilty of a holocaust

If an unreasonable warrant is served in the 'knock' fashion I can see
the warrant claim it is unreasonable allow the search and hire a
lawyer to have the evidence suppressed

If any warrant is served in the 'noknock' fashion all I
see is men with guns bashing in the door  Maybe they've got POLICE
or ATF jackets maybe they yell Police  But ANYONE can do that
with little effort Even if I have time to take in all this if I
decide they are police and fail to defend myself my decision could easily
be fatal

More likely I can't see the jackets before I have to decide whether to
defend myself or not and they yell as they are bashing in the door
so I can't hear them  Or they've already thrown in some flashbang
grenades deafening and confusing me

    The survivors claim it was not a suecide

It's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim  It is
clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that
BD members had started the fire

    BD's were not contemplating suecide and there is no reason 
    to believe they committed one

No reason  How about these two

  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the
	corridors and set fire to it  The speed at which the fire spread
	is not inconsistent with this claim

  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound
	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this
	fire  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did

  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide it is very possible that
	David Koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this
	was not suicide  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort

There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction

A  They are not dead but escaped via bunkeretc  From reports of the
	inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found I would rate this
	as highly unlikely

B  The fire was started by an FBI accident  This is possible but it would be
	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it
	Sure it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
	which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
	the day near the edge of the complex  It's anecdotal evidence that
	has been contradicted by other escapees

C  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI  This has been suggested by
	some on the NET and I would rate this possibility as utterly
	ludicrous  This is what we in sciskeptic would call an
	extraordinary claim and won't bother refuting unless someone gives
	any good evidence to back it up

So we are left with two reasonable possibilities  That the fire was an FBI
accident and that the fire was started by the BD  I find the latter more
likely based on the evidence I've seen so far

So you say the credibility of the FBI and ATF is questionalbe  So be it
But certainly the credibility of David Koresh was when he was alive

The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire  They
claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
masks  Hmmm  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
agent to me  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black  Note  this
is just speculation on my part  Still it is something to think about
Here's something else to ponder upon  the two agents that were planted
in the compound might have done something to start that fire  I don't
know if they did it deliberately or notif they did at allbut I
would like to see statements from these two agents on the events that
transpired during that day  I think that they would be rather
enlightening don't you think  They were inside the compound so they
ought to have a real good idea of what went on in there  Of course if
they did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would be
very forthcoming with any information

You are speculating that the FBI purposely started the fire  Please
if you've got such a ridiculously extraordinary claim and have no evidence
whatsoever at least give us a speculatory reason why the FBI would want to
do such a thing

The possibility that the fire was started accidentally is much more reasonable
but we don't have anything but contradictory anecdotal evidence right now

 	All you BD apologists seem to be conveniently forgetting
 Jonestown  It would have looked much worse if the feds had just
 waited till they all committed suicide  This was a no win situation
 although the final raid was a tragic failure  they should have
 been able to get more people out alive
 
	BD apologists

	Give me a break

	Yes BD apologists  There have been a number of posts defending
the BD's as some persecuted religous minority which is sheer bunk
Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term cult etc
but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff
It was a weapons raid  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's 
religion but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic 
weapons is a threat  This goes for neoNazis and other nonreligous groups
	So I have this question If your religious group isn't stockpiling
automatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity why is this
event a blow to religious freedom 

Mike

PS The analogy between BD's and Jews of the Holocaust is so insulting
and mindnumbingly stupid I won't even touch it with a ten foot pole

PPS Stop with the paranoid fantasies about the US goverment gunning you
down just because of your religous beliefs  Trust me nobody cares

At this point in time we don't who destroyed the BDs  Maybe it was the
government maybe it was Koresh  I wouldn't immediately rule out the
government just because the FBI said that a couple of cult members
torched Koresh's woodframe house  I think that the credibility of the
FBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best at worst they are
baldfaced liers  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that
survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their
woodframe house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the
compound to errupt in flames  Also I have heard that one of the cult
members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire
is no longer claiming that he did it  Moreover he and possibly the
other person may not have even really said that they did it in the
first placewe only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS  I'll believe it when
I hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then

The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire  They
claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
masks  Hmmm  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
agent to me  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black  Note  this
is just speculation on my part  

	Let me get this straight your theory is that the FBI 
accidentally started the fire while the ATF was deliberately starting 
it  That would certainly explain why they've been lying about the 
whole thing  that kind of screwup really would be embarrassing 
wouldn't it  There is of course only one weak spot in this theory  
we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were 
wearing black and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists 
of baldfaced liars  From this we can immediately conclude that 
they were not in fact wearing black and that that description was 
part of the FBI coverup  Who was it really  Come on now think  
who is really out to embarrass the Clinton administration  The 
answer is so obvious I don't see how you could have missed it  
That's right  it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans 
of course  And it worked too Clinton immediately backed down on 
the stimulus package didn't he

Still it is something to think about

Uh huh  

Later he writes
 The tear gas cannisterswhich do produce heat
despite what you may have been told by the mediamay have contributed
to starting the blaze  

	Now I'm getting confused  Did the tear gas canisters start 
the fire before or after the lantern and when was that in relation to 
when the ATF started it  Oh by the way the story I've been hearing 
is that no canisters were used since they didn't want to start 
a fire but we of course only have their word on that

	As you may be able to tell I'm not exactly persuaded

PS  The title for this thread is ridiculous  Feds couldn't give a hoot
about their religous ideas  weapons was the problem  Similar situations
have popped up with those I'm not gonna pay taxes freaks in Idaho etc 
where religion clearly has no bearing  Religous freedom here as an issue
is a complete smokescreen

  Exactly  What would happen if I barracade myself in my house for a
while with lots of firearms  Then when the police come with a search
warrent first I slam the door in their face then shoot at them when
they try to enter  After this I shoot at people who try to get me
to come out  This sort of thing happens every now and then and it
usually ends up being a shootout between the police and the persons
behind the barricade  Why are the Branch Davidians any different

Boy I really wish we we cut the drug war and have more people screwed up in

I'm sorry about your friend  Really  But this anecdote does nothing to
justify the war on drugs  If anything it demonstrates that the war
is a miserable failure  What it demonstrates is that people will take
drugs if they want to legal or not  Perhaps if your friend were taking

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
 

Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality 
uses a very flawed IMHO source of information to pass jusgement on all 
homosexual and bisexual men  It would seem more logical to say that since 
the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity 
larger as well  In my opinion orientation has nothing to do with it

Men are men and they all like sex  I am a gay male  I have had sex three 
times in my life all with the same man  Before that I was a virgin

So whose promiscuous

Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals  Just because 
someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do  Look at the world  
Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero

Look closely at the person not the group

All flames will be ignored

	Ahhh remember the days of Yesterday  When we were only

	When only  of the population would pay extra taxes

	Remember when a few of us predicted that it wasn't true  
	Remember the Inaugural   Dancing and Singing  Liberation
	at last  

	Well figure this out

	 VAT estimated to raise  Billion per year  on CNN 
	Work it out chum

	          taxpayers    year

        But you exclaim  I'll get FREE HEALTH CARE 
	But I exclaim  No you won't 

	This is only for that poor  million who have none  Not for
	YOU chum   That comes LATER

	Add in the estimates of the energy tax costs    year

	Plus all that extra corporate and rich taxes that will 
	trickle down and what do you have

	  year just like I said two months ago

	And the best part   You don't GET ANYTHING for it

	Deficit is STILL projected to rise at same rate it's  been
	rising at by CLINTON'S OWN ESTIMATES  And this assumes that
	his plan WILL WORK

	I mean come on it doesn't take a ROCKET SCIENTIST to see
	that in another  or  years we're GETTING ANOTHER WHOPPING
	TAX INCREASE because the deficit will STILL be GROWING 
	FASTER THAN the ECONOMY

	All Clinton is doing is moving us to a HIGHER diving board

        Face it  Clinton is Bush X   In four more years our
	country will be completely bankrupt and your children's
	future so oft mentioned by Pal Bill will be gone

	And those of you still deluding yourselves will be faced
	with the guilt

	Well glancing at watch gotta go  I want to be out of

NOTE crossposted to altpoliticsitaly and talkpoliticsmisc
 This is a reply to an article by Ed Ipser which also appeared in
 altpoliticsusamisc and altpoliticslibertarian but no longer belongs


I hate to defend Ed the article was very poorly written but here goes

hallamdscomsadesyde Phill HallamBaker writes
Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together
before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget
deficits here None of them are serious on the USA scale

Italy's percapita debt is much higher than USA's


We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers
for the benefit of the super wealthy

This is exactly what the public in France  Italy perceive to be the
problem thus the French election and Italian pulizia


Regarding the postpulizia Italy
What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much
better in the next election Most of the parliamentary deputies are going
to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people
who are free of any hint of corruption Look out for a parliament of
Pavarotti's and porn stars

Wrong  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a BritishAmerican style
firstpastthepost system in the Senate  If implemented it would
encourage a two or perhaps three party system in Italy
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which  new parties
will emerge to dominate  Will Lega Nord be one of these  Who knows

The Camera dei Deputati lower house will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house too Maybe as much as  firstpastthepost

Overall the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change  Italians
are tired of having crappy government  Porn stars Pavarotti's and
Hunters  Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead  A good twoparty
system will bring Italy efficient accountable government

It's about time

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
 

Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality 
uses a very flawed IMHO source of information to pass jusgement on all 
homosexual and bisexual men  It would seem more logical to say that since 
the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity 
larger as well  In my opinion orientation has nothing to do with it

I don't understand what you are getting at here  If the chances of 
promiscuity are larger yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual
community doesn't that imply that the homobi sexual population is then 
even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply  
No axe to grind here I'm just a scientist and I hate to see statistics abused

Men are men and they all like sex  I am a gay male  I have had sex three 
times in my life all with the same man  Before that I was a virgin

I am a hetero man and have had sex with one woman in my life my wife  It is 
very pleasing to me to be able to say that  I hope you have the same feeling
as I do  I also wish that you could if you wanted experience the joys and
trials of being committed to someone for life there is something about marriage
that makes the commitment much greater than one might expect

So whose promiscuous

Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals  Just because 
someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do  Look at the world  
Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero

Don't forget about the culture  Sadly we don't as a society look upon
homosexuality as normal and as we are all too well aware there are alot
of people who condemn it  As a result the gay population is not encouraged
to develop nonpromiscuous relationships  In fact there are many roadblocks
put in the way of such committed relationships  It is as if the heterosexual
community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays 
are immoral  My if we allowed gays to marry raise children  we might
just find out they're as moral as we are can't have that can we 

Just some thoughts  Flame away

On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
his so called stimulus package
It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
immunizations for poor kids

Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to
go have it done  The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents
who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done

    In case you haven't noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program  Access here means that folks who do not give 
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps

       I've read about more than a few of these programs that ran into
problems in convincing parents to get their children immunized even
when they were delivered to their doorstep  I don't know maybe
that sheet they have to be informed of about possible risks side
effects and bad reactions scares them  

    The immunization program is just a useful first step Among other
    things the money will go to pay for creating and maintaning a
    a computerized innoculation database on all US children
    codenamed Big Mother Just kidding the name will be Children
    Defense Database or something like that

    Once the money is spent and little or no tangible results achieved 
    the goverment will have to start knocking down doors in some 
    neigborhoods and bribe parents in others probably the ones that 
    are paying kids for attending the school  what a fantastic idea

I don't know where YOU live but this is not the case nationawide
Perhaps your state or municipality has put together the funds to 
do so but in my area and most areas where I know people immunizations
cost 

    Nationwide the immunization rate among toddlers is about  but
    it is reportedly as low as  in some innercity neighborhoods
    I bet more than  kids living in such neighborhoods are already 
    covered by Medicaid

    Here in Massachussets we have had a universal immunization program
    the kind of Clinton seems to be proposing for many years two decades
    Mass' immunization rate is   What about the other   I guess
    some parents are indeed too ignorant or too lazy  or simply do not 
    care

 The Selective Service Registration should be abolished  To start with the
 draft is immoral  Whether you agree with that or not we don't have one now
 and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
 with a volunteer army than with draftees  Finally the government has us
 on many lists in many computers the IRS Social Security Admistration and
 Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to
 Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
 Let's axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit

I'm really surprised Clinton hasn't already tried to do this  He seems
to want to tackle other irrelevant issues first so why not this one as well

Considering that Clinton received a draft notice and got out of it he admits it the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would
be inclined to risk any extra exposure on


Let me say this about that as a retired Navy officer 

I agree Cut it  But let's not stop there 

Eliminate the C transport 

Wrong  We need its capability  Sure it has its problems very few
airplanes haven't but getting rid of something we need is not the
answer  What do you want to do start over a rebuild a new airplane
from scatch  It'll have its problems as well and there will be calls
again for it to be scrapped  THe other option is to try to extend
the life of the Cs and Cs that are getting extremely old

If you read Aviation Week the C line can be reopened and the Cs
would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the 
program Politically though the C is popular pork


Scrap the Seawolf SSN nuclear submarine 
Ground the B stealth bomber 

It'll cost jobs but I'm for it  We especially don't need a B THe
SSN I know litttle about

Agreed Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf
The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there
is a lack of ASW foes to contend with The Navy is considering reducing
the number of attack subs to  Navy Times and that would entail
getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class

Politically General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get
Seawolf subs whether we need them or not

In addition more bases need to be closed Probably Long Beach Naval Station
and others The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being 
required to home port a total fleet of  ships

The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down
a pork happy Congress

SPEAKING OF VAT  Did anyone see CNN's report yesterday   It 
was quite hillarious no pun intended  They ran down how a percent tax
was added at each stage of manufacturing graphicaly depicting a stack of 
quarters being added at each wholesale stage  When they got to the final 
stage the actual retail sale the small stack of quarters added to the
large stack already there was said to be the amount paid by consumers
In other words they completed ignored the fact that at each stage the
tax would of course be passed on to the next buyer with the retail consumer
paying the full load

Actually Jerry Brown essentially didand Clinton in his demagogue
persona condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year

However

Why don't the Republicans get their act together and say they
will support a broadbased VAT that would have to be visible
the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform and
force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax
rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
be increased only via a national referendum

Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile
shift the tax burden from investment to consumption and get
health care reform and a frozen low top marginal tax rate
all in one fell swoop

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact not
from the fire

	Thoughts

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed 
Shouldn't that be up to a jury

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  Shouldn't that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial

	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective

First people should be aware that Brett's no last name listed 
posts on bitlistservpolitics indicate that he has been  
hostile toward GM's hiring policies and to the Moseley verdict 
when it came out  Equal opportunity disagreement I guess  

My guess without seeing the judge's opinion is that GM's motion 
was denied on due diligence grounds  Otherwise a party to a 
case could always keep one or two semicredible witnesses in 
reserve to spring if they lose  Not exactly a way to promote 
repose

Just TRY to justify the War On Drugs I DARE you

A friend of mine who smoke pot every day and last Tuesday took  hits of acid

is still having trouble aiming for the bowl when he takes a dump  Don't as

me how I just have seen the results

Boy I really wish we we cut the drug war and have more people screwed up in
the head

I'm sorry about your friend  Really  But this anecdote does nothing to
justify the war on drugs  If anything it demonstrates that the war
is a miserable failure  What it demonstrates is that people will take
drugs if they want to legal or not  Perhaps if your friend were taking
legal regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the
position he's in now


I do agree with you in a way  The war on drugs has failed but in my opinion
that doesn't mean we have to give up  Only change the tactics

For instance here are how some penalties should be changed

Dealing Coke  Death
Dealing Heroin  Death
Dealing Pot  Death
Dealing Crack  Death

The list goes on and on

JUST KIDDING

However on a more serious note I do believe that we should take some money 
away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border 
interdiction efforts  Don't think I'm going to say spend it to educate 
people because I know plenty of educated dopers  Actually spend it on  
things like drug treatment programs

I saw an interesting story on  minutes about how the British actually 
prescribe and addict his recommended dosage and try to ween him off from it
or cut the amount down to levels where it is acceptable  Sounds good so far 
from what I heard with a decrease in cost lower addiction rates by wiping out 
the dealer's markets etc But that was the only thing I have heard about it

However legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be 
bought like cigarettes is just plain silly  Plus I have never heard of a 
recommended dosage for drugs like crack ecstasy chrystal meth and LSD
The  Minute Report said it worked with cocaine cigarettes pot and heroin

 Institute a national sales tax to pay for the socialization of

  Declare war on Serbia Reenact the draft

  Stimulate the economy with massive income transfers to Democtratic
    constituencies

  Appoint an unrepetent socialist like Mario Cuomo to the Suprmeme Court

  Focus like a laser beam on gays in the military

  Put Hillary in charge of the Ministry of Truth and move Stephanopoulos
    over to socialzed health care

  Balance the budget through confiscatory taxation

  Remind everyone again how despite the Democrats holding the
    Presidency the majority of seats in the House and in the Senate
    the Republicans have still managed to block his taxandspend programs

  Go back to England and get a refresher course in European Socialism

 Yes you are  When you and the rest of the homosexual community
 pass laws to impose your moral codes on me by requiring me to
 hire rent to or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
 my will yes you are in my face  Until homosexuals stop trying
 to impose their morals on me I will be in your face about this

Your post is based on the premise that the laws as they stand do not
discriminate anybody so your argument falls over immediately  Are you

Why not try to eliminate discrimination from existing laws instead of
trying to add discrimination that favors your group

Thankfully you got the gender right  For I am not a deviant

A deviant is someone who does not fit an accepted norm  By that definition I would certainly be a deviant as bisexuality is not an accepted norm in American society so far  This term of course really has no negative aspects inherent in its denotation  I presume you intended it as a term of abuse  It's a great pity you feel such tactics to be necessary but hardly surprising since you have no factual basis for your absurd beliefs

 how disparaging you are towards political minorities

Sexual deviants do not comprise a political minority

May I attempt to emulate your style of discourse with a term of abuse  AhemYou addlepated jellyfish  The post to which I responded was a highly amusing one in which you belittled homosexuals for having no political clout  I would be further amused if you would explain to me why having no political clout and constituting a political minority are different

I only associate with girls who do indeed have selfrespect  But were

And yet you call them girls  The feminists would be up in arms

door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as
homosexuality I would encourage her to indeed do so and I would
further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on
the way out  Who needs such an airhead

Cough cough  Well well you certainly are a fine upstanding fellow you are sir  And like many fine upstanding fellows you have the reading comprehension of a dyslexic anteater  Perhaps I should have been more explicit in pointing out that females constitute a political minority in this country when last I checked and that your obvious lack of respect for these minorities equates to a lack of respect for women  That is of course a conceptual stretch of logic but given your slow uptake as de

to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the
nature of man where practically every other generation has failed


Foolish and misguided  Oh this is too much  So which religious figure do YOU believe you are  And how do you know so much about the nature of man  You're almost too amusing to be worth the effort of crushing your pealike brain

parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

Ok one last time  yeah right  In order for you to not pay for any
abortions through your tax money everyone would have to not pay for
any abortions through tax money

Ok one last time  yeah right

Many who oppose federal funding for abortions would be quite happy
simply to specify that their tax money not be used to support programs
to which they morally object  Failing that the House Ways and Means
Committee has so far rejected similar proposals their only recourse
is to object to the program itself  This they do but you don't seem
to like that  What other choice do you offer  You suggest they
should not consider how portions of their individual tax money are
spent  Why not

Suppose you had the option to specify that your tax money can't pay for
abortions  Do you think that that should entitle you to pay less taxes
Since refusing to fund abortions would lead to an even larger increase in
funding for prenatal care and delivery if anything you should pay more
taxes  Suppose we let your taxes stay at the same level

Do you really think that funding for abortion would be reduced  No your
taxes would go towards other things and more taxes from those who don't
object to paying for abortion would be moved from those other things to
pay for abortions  All that happens is that the funds get shuffled around
to give you a clear conscience  Why put the government through all that
paperwork when the end result is no different  Why worry about it when
it makes no difference and it doesn't hurt you in the least

Your advice

     People should stop worrying about where their individual money is
     going and instead vote for how government should spend all
     the money it gets  Currently the dulyelected president proposes
     that federal medical programs include abortions in their coverage
     If the dulyelected Congress goes along with it well there you
     gothat is how our system of representation works
     Parenthetical comments removed

is similar to the horrible advice some offer potential rape victims
It's going to happen anyway so you might as well just lie back and
enjoy it

That is the most rediculous outofcontext analogy I have every heard  I
do not advocate any such advice  There is quite a difference between
the illegal violation called rape and the constitutionally granted power
of taxation along with the funding of legal procedures  If you can't see
the difference you can go to hell

Care to respond this time Mr Parker

The following challenges remain unmet by Mr Parker  From his own
comments we are left to presume they were too much for him

Your yanking followups to posts of mine from other threads does not
demonstrate any deliberate lack of response on my part  There is a great
deal of bandwidth on talkabortion and it can take a long time to get
through to the followups to articles I have posted and many times responses
expire before I get to reading them

It is pretty fucking arrogant of you to pull copies here and demand that
I respond to them here when they were posted already and quite possibly
responded to separately  I believe I have indeed responded to some of
the following previouslythough probably not each of them



parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

By the way thanks so much for deleting the context of this next line in
your followup to it

No I have some objective nonreligious reasons with justification for
why personity makes an appropriate value system 

Please define personity and enumerate the reasons which justify it
as an appropriate value system

I have done so in the past  It isn't my fault that you never saw it

Here is a brief explanation

A person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights
of another person  If you want to hear more about this aspect of personity
go read the thread Why is bodily autonomy so important on talkabortion
You may have to look at all unexpired posts on that thread to find the post
where I give a fairly detailed explanation  I believe it was posted on
April  or 

The second part is a definition of a person  A simplistic explanation is
that a person is a member of society  Most normal adult human beings are
good examples of people  Most children over two years old are people as
well  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation
with them  It is actually more complicated than that but I have no desire
to spend the time it would take to explain it to you  Read the thread Why
is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification



parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

If the government refused
to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then
it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose
mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby
will also require care for  years

Have you statistics that demonstrate the majority of the population
has no qualm with government funding for abortions  I suspect you
fail to account for the position of the person who wishes abortion
neither banned nor federally funded

Actually I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not
those who object to federal funding  I admit I did not say it very
clearly and apologize for that

Do you have statistics that might answer this question  Or are you just
blowing smoke

A Prochoice president  of  who ran was elected  That means the
country basically supports the choice to have an abortion 

Surely you don't wish to suggest the recent presidential election was
nothing more than a nationwide referendum on the abortion issue

I said what I said  If you had not deleted most of it everyone could
see for themselves what I said

To refuse to fund abortions  is to remove that choice from some
women and add the additional burden to society for no reason

Are we simply to take it on your authority that there is no reason

If you disagree then give us some reasons  Given that abortion is
LEGAL and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the
population or can you provide unbiased statistics  I doubt you can
because I have never heard of an unbiased poll that has been conducted
it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford
them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you
would force upon them  I refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice
from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure

Where does it end  To refuse to fund the free distribution of guns is
to remove the choice to own a gun from some women and add the burden
of police protection to society

More guns in society does not reduce the burden on the police
it increases it

                                  To refuse to provide everyone with
an automobile is to remove the choice to drive from some women and add
the additional burden of public transportation to society

Now this is rediculous  Public transportation puts less of a burden on
transportation routes roads rails etc than private transportation
It also puts a lesser burden on the environment

                                                            To refuse
to fund a jobs for everyone is to remove the choice to work from some
women and add the additional burden of unemployment to society

Oh this makes sense  Ever hear of welfare  Know what it's all about



parkerehsncenuiucedu Robert S Parker writes

Not to mention the fact that the people who would get the death
penalty are convicted of horrible crimes  Senseless murders
multiple murders and so on One could argue that these people have
no right to live in our society

Please show us this argument  I suspect it is quite strained as it
must include those wrongly convicted who remain innocent regardless
of the severity of the crimes

I said one could argue it I didn't say it was a convincing argument

We do not want them ever and we should not have to pay to keep
them alive for as long as they happen to live

First infants now certain adults  Does anyone have a right to life
Mr Parker  If so precisely who

Not infants you idiot  Infants are born

Who has a right to life  People who have not violated other's rights
have a right to life  A fetus is not a person  You can not have a
conversation with them  They are not biologically independent  Their
awareness is questionable  They have no experiences in the real world
to make up a personality

If its a matter of money we could save a lot of money by killing off 
anyone with an expensive illness  It may decrease our population a bit
but we will have plenty of money to go around

Hey why not  Oh wait maybe their family members would object  Ya think
Their parentschildrenbrotherssisters  Is that the case with abortion

And if no family member objects should we allow this killing  Should
we include it as a costsaving device in our health care reform
package  These questions are not rhetorical

Ever hear of euthanasia  Ever hear of insurance companies refusing to
fund potentially lifesaving treatment because they don't feel there is
sufficient evidence that it will work to be worth the expense  Which one
gets you angrier  Why is that

I find it very interesting that you say there will be  million
queers in the march on Washington  The largest figure I've seen in
the press is  million and we all know how liberal the press is with
their numbers 

For another thing  of  million is  million not   Maybe
that's where you got the  million number  Also the number cited
in the actual report is  so that would be about  million

As for this march on Washington I wonder how much the media is
going to inflate the numbers this time  Last time for the
proabortion rally they more than doubled the actual number of
people who showed up  That and all the stories coming out of how
the press slants the news really makes one wonder who's watching
the watchers

Why are you all playing these pathetic number games  The number of people
showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace  I doubt
that it constitutes more than a handful of us  I'm queer and I won't be
there simply because I don't have the time or the transportation  What the
hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum
number

Face it people we're everywhere  There are always more of us than you
think  Our numbers are constantly GROWING not diminishingsome of your
children will grow up to join us  Hell some of MY children may grow up to
join us  The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and
blind yourself to it but to realize that you have nothing to fear  We're
not perverts we're not dangerous we're just here and we're human just
like youer most of you

Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like  It won't do them one
iota of good

Drewcifer

PS  I still can't get over the fact that some people actually believe that
every queer in the US would show up at the MOW and that these numbers are
meaningful  And come to think of it what about those of us in OTHER
countries  Tree

   However legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to
   be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly  Plus I have never
   heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack ecstasy chrystal
   meth and LSD  The  Minute Report said it worked with cocaine
   cigarettes pot and heroin
  
  Or the government could adopt the radical and probably unAmerican idea
  that citizens are free to live their lives as they wish and simply
  decriminalize cocaine marijuana heroin LSD etc  Please explain why
  the idea of allowing recreational drugs to be bought like cigarettes
  is just plain silly  After all it works just fine for nicotine

 I'm all in favor of drug legalization but I do see some problems with
 it My hope is that people disposed to doing so would simply overdose
 quickly and be done with it before making a mess of thisgs

It's actually quite simple We sell Drug Use Licenses to anybody over age
 who wants one  Costs  and you're required to attend a week of
night classes on the effects of drugs on the human body At the end of the
class you sign an informed consent waiver acknowledging that you've been
told that drugs are bad for you but you want them anyway In doing so
you giver up ANY right to statepaid medical care for whatever might
happen to you as a result of doing drugs or any right to collect welfare
or unemployment should you lose your job as a result of using drugs You'd
also give up your right to drive a car  

Anybody caught using drugs without a license has a choice pay a 
fine and accept a backdated drug user's license or go to prison

In a letter to the FBI David Koresh said Do you want me to
pull back the heavens and show you my anger  fear me''  The  day
standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 
in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire  Now that the multimillion
dollar standoff is over a few things remain cleaning up the mess and
assigning blame



From the onset of the April  tear gas attacks by federal agents President
Clinton already started passing the buck by saying Talk to the attorney
general or the FBI I knew it was going to be done but the decision was
it entirely theirs  it They made the tactical decision'' Enter
Attorney General Janet Reno  After most of the Branch Davidians died
Reno said she took full responsibility'' for the decision  I approved
the plan'' she said adding that she did not advise him Clinton as to the
details''  In fact she told Clinton that it was the best way to go''
As the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said
that he was deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that
the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the
course of action pursued today''  Later he went on to say I stand by that
Reno's decision''



How did this all begin  At  on February  agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms BATF launched a fullscale highprofile
assault on the Branch Davidian's compound  This raid was much
more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons  The
assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF
to show their might and just purpose



At the onset of the noknock'' raid gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents
made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state
that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began
Silently the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started
their search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades
and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings



If unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues
were to attack you throwing grenades and brandishing firearms would you not
assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself  The
tactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle



The initial assualt by the BATF was not successful  Unfortunately lives
were lost on both sides  But had the assault been a success the liberal
media would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents
carting away a bunch of gunwielding religious nuts  Of course any
violation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media
would proclaim America's fortune in having supercop organizations like the
BATF that can systematically take out'' terroristic groups such as the
Branch Davidians



As far as I can see the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball  just like
Philadelphia did in the  MOVE crisis which left  dead  homeless
and a city block razed
It appears that the BATF has adopted the shootfirst tactic of noknock
raids to execute search warrants  Don't let the BATF convince you that
the noknock raid was justified  Noknock assaults make sense when looking
for say drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds
The BATF was looking for illegal weapons not drugs that could be hidden or
flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds  What ever happened to
This is the police  You are surrounded''  it This policy of noknock
raids by federal and local agencies should be restricted  Further the use
of military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea
and is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that
their fourth ammendment rights the right of the people to be secure in
their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches
and seizures'' are not denied

From article qvampINNmhfdarkstarUCSCEDU by stephenorchidUCSCEDU

 Now which is it  Are you going to comdemn national media then turn around
 and use it to support some position you present  Seems somewhat contradictory
 doesn't it

I believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that
the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the
subject at hand  The media has proven itself very accurate
is the areas of presenting raw undisputed data  One good
example would be the weather page in which high and low
temperatures of the previous day for a large number of
locations are posting  There is little evidence to show
that they are in error

I believe this true when we speak of physical data in the
sense of pure science  But when we speak of data that revolve
around social sciences then we have to be careful


The American media has failed us in its analysis of complex
events however  I'm sure that we can come up with many
news stories that have left us angry because so many facts
have been ommitted  Cases that come to mind are the
invasion of Panama the war with Iraq the disaster in Waco
the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the
military the war on drugs and many others


I quite agree  But these are cases or 'news events' that contain
politics social science information sociology etc  and at
best are reflections of the group that reports them

As you have pointed out it is difficult to report that the
temperature was  degrees when it was  degrees and have
people believe you

The story that you bring to light was regarding the new
sex survey  While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of
the data was ommitted from the article I would venture to
guess that the data that was presented did not deviate
from the survey  I do however think that it would be
folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's
analysis of this data  In this particular case there was
little analysis and the reader was left to draw hisher
own convictions

Yes and no  The survey presented according to Mr Cramer
a value called the median which one used this makes us 
believe that  of the males had  plus sex partners and
 of the males had  or less sex partners  Homosexuals
are purported to make up only   In this case the majority
of people with  plus sex partners are heterosexual

It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage
But if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr Cramer
claims about gay promiscuity  hetero promiscuity


Many netters Mr Cramer included often forget that the
American media are merely a number of businesses who's
purpose in life is to make money for their owners and
stockholders  Revenues come largely from advertisers
who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar  The
media is like fast food the quality of the food or of
the reporting will improve only if the customers demand
as such  Otherwise it is business as usual
 
 Very good this is a point that I have tried to bring out
and as any network news program will show you it is true

The News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because
of where its loyalties lie

There is an old statement by a man  and I cannot remember him
or his statment exactly but it warns against the merger of
business and news reporting because of the obvious consequences
What master is news going to serve in the end The advertiser
and the bias of the news group

To explain my position on the War On Drugs I offer this

Drugs And Crime A New Approach

by Ken Barnes


Given that

 The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for 
much of the crime which afflicts our nation

 People who want drugs particularly people who 
are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get 
them whether or not they are legally available

 Despite current law enforcement efforts drugs 
are readily available to those who want them

 Addiction to drugs both legal and illegal is 
responsible for a significant drain on the productive 
resources of our country and this occurs in a variety 
of ways from the cocaineaddicted babies who are 
unable to learn to the spread of disease among 
addicts to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse 
and tobacco smoking

 A general economic principle of government is 
that whatever is subsidized you get more of and 
whatever is taxed you get less of  To be most 
effective in confronting the nation's drug problem 
some way must be found to utilize these additional 
powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use 
less attractive

While this country's current efforts to combat 
legal drugs have succeeded in some respects there is 
a greater awareness of the health consequences of 
smoking and designateddriver programs have helped 
reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot be 
said for the war on illegal drugs  There remains a 
core group of illegal drug users which support 
international networks of smugglers pushers growers 
processors kingpins and gangsters  These networks 
and their marketing activities which include drive
by shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities 
and smuggling weapons are directly or indirectly 
responsible for a large proportion of the crimes 
committed in our country every day

Clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are 
linked  It takes only a moment's reflection to 
recognize how they are linked  The link is money  As 
with this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol 
consumption a black market has been created in which 
greedy local monopolies like the gangsters of a 
bygone era have profited enormously from their 
illegal trade  The victims of this trade include not 
only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be 
caught in the crossfire but I would argue the drug 
users themselves

Were it not for the black market and the violent 
monopoly of the drug lords drug users might not be 
the thieves robbers prostitutes and murderers they 
have become in order to pay the high prices the drug 
lords demand  In the absence of the drug lords most  
would be I believe simply people with a problem 
either a moral problemora medical problem butnota 
criminal problem

Let me be clear however I amnotadvocating that 
we let the criminals who have been preying on our 
society for these many years of Prohibition off the 
hook  On the contrary the new approach I advocate is 
one which would not result in either the government or 
private industry getting into the business of 
promoting crack cocaine or any other presently 
illegal drug for that matter  Neither is it an 
approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over 
more and more of their freedom and privacy in an 
effort to track down illegal drug users until the 
land of the free and the home of the brave looks like 
a police state

Here then is my proposal

 Possession and use of all presently illegal 
drugs is decriminalized but buying and selling them 
remains illegal  'Potheads' can grow their own 
marijuana as many already do today other drug users 
can legally import their poison of choice as long as 
they pay the tariffs and a barter economy of drug 
experimenters develops

 Because of the barter economy which supplies 
the drug users the black market profits that have so 
enriched the drug lords dwindle  If these drugs can 
be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing why buy 
them  Nevertheless there will be those who will seek 
to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively 
low prices  Therefore

 Law enforcement activity is concentrated on 
those individuals who continue to buy and sell and 
also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to 
afford even low prices  But here is where the 
strategy begins to differentiate between the drug 
dealers the victimizers and the drug users their 
victims

 Upon arrest foranycrimesuspects are 
permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a 
drug test  Those who choose to cooperate are informed 
that upon conviction for the crime they are accused 
of if they are found to be a drug user they will be 
institutionalized until they are clean and only then 
will they begin to serve their sentence  If they 
choose to cooperate and are already drugfree they 
can begin to serve their sentence right away  Those 
who choose not to undergo the drug test and are 
convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer 
sentences

 Institutionalization of drug using criminals 
serves several purposes

Drug using criminals and this includes drunk 
andor 'stoned' drivers are separated from their 
sources of supply thus reducing the total number of 
drug users in society at large and consequently 
decreasing the demand for drugs on the street putting 
more of the remaining drug dealers out of business

Institutionalization provides an incentive for 
drug using criminals to straighten themselves out 
before becoming part of the general prison population

While helping protect society from crime 
institutionalization could also serve to deter drug 
users from becoming criminals since drug using 
criminals unlike other criminals would be delayed 
prior to serving their sentences by the additional 
time it takes for them to sober up

Institutionalization of drug using criminals 
separate from the general prison population would also 
provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could 
volunteer for research studies of new techniques and 
treatments for addictive disease with the potential 
to benefit both themselves and others

 Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not 
drug users themselves and this is particularly true 
of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit 
organizations  Under this proposal dealers would be 
more readily identifiable since upon arrest they 
would presumably pass the drug test or else decline 
to take it in order to avoid having to explain why 
they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent 
they do not use them  Declining to take the test 
they would of course face stiffer penalties  While 
each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug 
would have to stand on own its merits the outcome of 
a suspect's drug test could provide additional 
evidence for the prosecution

 Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to 
the decline of smoking in our country by making 
cigarettes more costly while at the same time 
providing revenue for antismoking campaigns 
noncommercial drugs should be taxed and the money 
generated should be used to combat their use  
Enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis 
however and should not be used as an excuse to 
infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial 
drug users since to do so would have the effect of 
reintroducing Prohibition

Instead drug users will be encouraged to pay the 
tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever 
found in their possession during the course of routine 
police operations they will be required to pay the 
tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to 
be destroyed  If drug dealers are found to be selling 
noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid 
they will face additional prosecution for evading the 
tax  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug 
dealing charges is already in use in some 
jurisdictions but its effectiveness is currently 
limited by the illegality of drug possession

Revenue from drug possession taxes and import 
tariffs would be used to fund antidrug advertising 
campaigns and provide support to private sector drug 
treatment programs for those unable to afford 
treatment

 Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must 
be ended  Federal support of tobacco farming is both 
immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets and 
the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands 
in many states must likewise be eliminated

While my proposal would have the effect of 
permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs it 
would hold the users of all drugs responsible for 
their actions and I believe would reduce the harm 
drugs have on our society particularly the crime 
caused by the illegal drug trade  So long as we 
remain a free nation with relatively porous borders 
and freedom for our citizens to travel we will always 
have a drug problem  Whether it takes the form of 
heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings drunk 
drivers killing and maiming others on our streets or 
emphysema patients struggling for breath after a 
lifetime of smoking the results are the same 
needless suffering and death  As a society we must 
recognize that while our society permits us to harm 
ourselves with drugs as we are already doing 
regardless of the drug laws we must take a stand 
against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to 
others  We must particularly oppose the vicious and 
violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug 
users  By taking the profits out of their deadly 
trade my proposal goes a long way towards shutting 
down these powerful criminal organizations

The question of whether drug use is a moral or 
medical problem depends on which group of drug users 
you're talking about  Different drugs have different 
effects and some are more addictive than others  The 
addictiveness of a drug also often varies between 
individuals and so we have some people who can drink 
alcohol in moderation while others find they cannot 
resist the bottle  Nicotine which former Surgeon 
General C Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as 
heroin is a legal drug with known harmful effects 
and while some people can stop smoking by willpower 
alone others continue to smoke even after treatment 
for lung cancer

For those individuals who can stop taking drugs 
on their own we may argue that because they have 
chosen to use them this represents a moral failure on 
their part or an unwillingness to face the 
difficulties of life  But for the addicts while they 
may have chosen to use drugs the first time by the 
time they discover their addiction it is too late  We 
cannot hold them responsible for their disease any 
more than we would blame someone who is drowning for 
an inability to swim  Perhaps they should have known 
not to go near the water or perhaps someone should 
have warned them of the danger but in their present 
circumstances warnings will not help  Neither does it 
help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing 
them weights

Also in the April  Globe and Mail there was a letter from the
director of trauma services at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto
responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in
California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that

That study which was in the NEJM I think noted that the frequency
of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in
California I guess richer people have more heart disease in 
California   whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over
seventy in Canada was relatively uniform across income distribution
Heart surgery was more frequent in California but mortality and
outcomes were essentially the same

American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada
rationed vital services The doctor I can't recall his name said
that Canada is rationing vital services as any physician can
plainly see He said that a system in which people are refused
treatment because they can't afford it is no different from a system
in which people are refused treatment because the government can't
afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health
insurance plan In fairness he did say that both the US and 
Canadian systems are in the same situation

The NDP cleaning up a Tory spending mess And just when I thought 
I understood Canadian politics


There was one about a group of doctors in Calgary who have opened
Canada's first USstyle MRI clinic as an alternative to the
provincially owned one

It's about time  I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they
don't invest in their own private practices  in the end it's their
money  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams and
that's none of my business  As for provincially owned  for sure
it's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved
in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser
vations  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by
on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use  no kidding
Medical practice itself is much more conservative up north  My own
best friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN
and is no stranger to high tech medicine  but his boat comes first

There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of
twotiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act

No it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have
private practices  and always have  They can all take cash
anyways  so why not have a particular facility  The Canadian
big government mentality often imagines government where it does
not even exist 


The only potential problem I see with the private MRI facilty in Calgary is the
selfreferral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial
interest in it which is basically unethicalbut in Canada because
of our small population there is likely only to be a few private
facilities involving only a small number of doctors
and thus I don't think the selfreferral problem which is an epidemic in the
US could ever get out of hand here

Look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI 
nobody stopped them when they bought it  Nobody seems to be stopping
them from using it either  Much ado about nothing  Thank goodness
that hockey playoffs have started 


It is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully

While it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by
the head of the partnership to demonstrate the MRI He showed an
image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of
the bank who approved the loan He said that without it the guy
might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial MRI then
another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would
have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder 
If that isn't the first whiff of two tiers I don't know what is

I'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the GAO study
of Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a
problem  I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened 
to American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit
There are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without
relying on MRI  unfortunately I've had a few   And I'm not
a banker 


What likely happened is the sponsors of the private MRI which include
doctors anticipated that Alberta would need more MRI's and instead
of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another
one or two saw a business opportunitywhere they would have a
secure business from the public insurance side of things and they
could supplement people and businesses who want to pay cash

          When you and the rest of the homosexual community

  to impose their morals on me I will be in your face about this

 Ahh what's good for the goose is not necessarily what's good for
 the gander  You don't want homosexuals to impose their moral codes
 such diabolical ideas as equal rights on you yet you are willing
 to impose your moral codes on them  Do I detect a double standard

   What exactly does the American Constitution say about the right 
to association  
   Homosexuals whether Clayton likes it or not are as much members
of society as he is As such they have the right to participate and
have an equal opportunity to pursue their goals
   Noone is saying that Clayton should be forced to associate with
queerfolk in his private life one suspects the gays in question would
object also   but by proclaiming the general right not to associate
with them in the public sphere which includes housing hiring etc
he's giving his right to nonassociation priority over their rights to
equal access to opportunity
   Historically people can associate publically with disliked groups
with very little illeffect however cutting a group off from normal
commerce has a severe impact on their lives
   Clayton why exactly should your right to nonassociation in the
public sphere take priority over homosexual's rights to equal opportunity

     Male sex survey Gay activity low
 
     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American men's sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
      percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

The politicians will have plenty to be scared of in one week be it  or


  It will be interesting to see the reaction when million queers
    gather in Washington DC After all if there are only million of
    us then this is an event unprecidented in history

But many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals but
other members of the leftist agenda

I'm sure there will be a few non queers but the vast majority are
queer

I find it very interesting that you say there will be  million
queers in the march on Washington  The largest figure I've seen in
the press is  million and we all know how liberal the press is with
their numbers 

For another thing  of  million is  million not   Maybe
that's where you got the  million number  Also the number cited
in the actual report is  so that would be about  million

As for this march on Washington I wonder how much the media is
going to inflate the numbers this time  Last time for the
proabortion rally they more than doubled the actual number of
people who showed up  That and all the stories coming out of how
the press slants the news really makes one wonder who's watching
the watchers

 Hmmm what statistics are these Can you offer any references The only
 studies I've seen indicate a higher proportion of homosexuals in prison
 than in the general population but I don't think that allows for the
 default you refer to Prison is not a normal situation
 
 But I haven't seen anything that suggests that the default proportion is
 lower than in the general population although it seems plausible
 
 Anyway as I say can you provide any references
 
 

Is this an arguement against or for  Or simply a statement of agreeance
disagreeance  The fact that there are more homosexuals in prison does not
mean that homosexuals are immoral and more liable to commit crime  And one
must remember that prison is not necessarily a reflection of the type of
people who are criminals  What are the statistics for unsolved crime

There is also the question of cause and effect

In article Apracsokstateedu kennejsacsokstateedu KENNEDY JAMES SCOT writes
 Recent studies have shown that the number of men who have
 engaged in homosexual activities in the last decade is 
 and the number of men who are exclusively homosexual is 
 These figures are much less than those that came from earlier
 studies that showed that homosexuality among men is a lot
 higher
 
 So what can we deduce from these figures  Are there a lot
 less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men
 perhaps women too not as honest as they used to be about
 there sexuality  Presumably the people that were polled in

You mean in the s men and women were much more open about
their homosexuality than today  Want to try that one again

 this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should
 have answered the questions honestly I suppose  However it
 could be that gays feel so repressed and denigrated by society
 that they didn't feel that they could be forthcoming about there
 sexuality in something like a survey  If this true then is it
 possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led
 to believe
 
 Perhaps if Americans were more open about there sexualityI think
 most Americans aren'tthen we might discover that there are really
 quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same
 sexmen and women included  I'd venture a guess that there is a
 lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship
 with someone of the same sex at some point in there life  Maybe they
 didn't take their longings seriously but this doesn't make these
 longings any less valid  Therefore if Americans weren't so
 repressed about their sexuality in generalas I believe they may be
 then we'd see a lot more people coming out of the closet

You mean ignore study after study so that we can continue to 
accept a study Kinsey's that is obviously wrong  

 As for myself I'm a heterosexual and I've never considered having
 sex with another man  That's just the way I amI could have just
 as easily of been gay I suppose  One of the big debates about
 homosexuality is whether or not it's a type of behavior that is
 learned or if one is just born that way  IMHO the more likely
 explanation is that it's some combination of the two

Based on what besides your own warm fuzzy feelings

 Here's something to ponder upon  have any of you gaybashers out
 there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual
 orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an
 intrinsic and natural part of their life as heterosexuals do
 about their own sexuality  In other words someone who is truly

Alcoholics share that feeling until they hit bottom

 gay may not be able to live any other way  Even if they date someone
 of the opposite sex or get married in their heart they are still a
 homosexual  Likewise if someone who is truly heterosexual forms
 a relationship with someone of the same sex then they are still
 a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise
 
 Scott Kennedy  Brewer and Patriot

Unless of course the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder caused by childhood sexual abuse as a number of
recent works suggest

If homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
morality on others antidiscrimination laws and leave our children
alone I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private  But
until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of 
government is to tell peaceful people how to live I have no choice
but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an alternative
lifestyle but a sickness

 Before  David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets
           the Bible through the barrel of a gun  ATF spokesman
 After   The ATF is a cheap thug who interprets

    Geez where have you been Ryan  I proposed this theory months
 ago  Let's take it one step further even  If as the surveys show
 up to  of all men have had a homosexual encounter then there must

Cite a survey other than the obviously bogus Kinsey studies

 be an even larger percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
 fantasies  But if less than  of the population is gay what can we
 say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated
 gay potential  Obviously a large chunk of these people chose or
 more accurately were forced to choose by force of religion and social
 sanction to put those feelings aside to be heterosexual
 
    Obviously Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category

I can't speak for Kaldis but force of religion and social sanction
played no part in my sexual preferences  Neither had much influence on

     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American men's sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago
 
 Right off the bat this information is flawed  Most throrough  I'm
 sorry but Masters  Johnson put out a report within the past few
 years  The Kinsey Institute has been quite active since it was
 founded ohsomany years ago  They too recently put out a new
 report on sexuality

I was quoting a news story  I have no idea why they claim this was
the most through examination

     shows about 
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
      percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual
 
 I hate to be picky but let's do the math  If we take the cities of
 New York City and Los Angeles alone we can find approximately 
 million gay peoplemaking about  million gay men

WHAT  Even in San Francisco the Dept of Public Health estimates
that only  of the male population is gay  What you are claiming
is that of the  million people in the NYC and LA areas that more
than  are gay  What is the source of your numbers  Keep in
mind that attempts by CDC to determine homosexual percentage in
American cities have given numbers 

  of the American male population is about  million
 
 So what this study says is that all gay males live in New York City or
 Los Angeles and about halfamillion people are lying about being gay
 
 Something smells funny

Yes your  million number smells funny

 Well the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
 if the oppertunity presented itself
 
 I reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
 huge variety of willing partners  The question here is not of being

That I suppose says a lot about how screwed up you are

 the information you claim to have  I respectfully request that you either
 provide the information or withdraw the various assertions you make below
 
 Item number   in a previous posting you stated that you had found
 overwhelming support for child molestation in socmotss
 
 You have finally responded to this one  I have read your complete file
 of postings to socmotss and to put it bluntly it does not support your
 assertion  In short this claim is bogus  Thank you for confirming this

All those postings in defense of adults having sex with children and
you just choose to claim that they don't say anything of the sort
There's no point in discussing this any further then  You are clearly
a liar without morals of any sort prepared to justify child molestation

 So  What does this prove  I do not object to property ownership  I
 just think property ownership should be limited to what an individual
 personfamily needs  I do not need  acres to survive  I
 need about  acres at most and could get by on less  I argue that
 by having all property tied up and thus cutting people off form
 the basic level of subsistance that the property owners must bribe
 the rest of us to respect their ownership rights by providing
 alternative means of subsistance  When we are expected to give
 these peoperty owners lets call them thieves bribes in order to
 be able to subsists then we have a sick situation   The property owners
 are then parasites  

I want people to be able to live happy and prosperous lives  Property
owners cannot maintain a monopoly in the free enterprise system unless
they have help from a coercive government  When a few land owners get
together and try to control all the land without selling land prices
will go up  At some point it will be to the advantage of the land owner
to sell some of his property  Trying to put a group of people to
distribute land fairly would give them monopoly control over the
land and would have the consequences you speak of  Let's keep the land
out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market

It's already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism
of land Other than government land saved for posterity and the ecosystem
as well as government function the remaining land is owned by a smaller
percentage of the people than ever before The game of capitalism is almost
won The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters
into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly or else be enslaved in
return for a place to live Here in central California already fewer than
 own all the property and  of them own  of it That's twice what it
was twenty years ago Rents are so high that you pay  of your income for
rent If you just have a McJob all you can afford is one room if that
Some  of minimum wage workers are homeless Unless you both have degrees
in technical fields and are working in them in the midst of 
unemployment in high tech jobs you will never own anything but a used
car if you choose to have more than one child And everywhere else you
could afford there are no jobs The only way to get there is to save and
not consume any more than you have to clothing used food poor No movies
no entertainment ect for about five to seven years and then if you've
saved  if you can get together that much and that's ignoring your
kids and working two jobs then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri
outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year That's an
exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other
people's houses and find a sturdy hill then you can buy one up there Also
buy a rowboat Missouri's not so bad if you like the sensation of sleeping
in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter They really
do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to
start with ether Shit kill the rich and redistribute the livable
property Kill all of them

The land is simply granted to people who live on it now Extra is kept for

you want to grow sourgum because you always did and you aren't doing a
good job then we let another farmer grow sorghum and you grow something
else When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the
public holdings No one can sell land but they can trade places with
anybody No one can lease land The government will locally distribute the
use of the land not used for residences Residences that are insufficient
to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house
and yard according to need and availability The local land council who vow
to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness
subject to review by the state and federal land councils It will cost no
more than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a
deep dark hole to the owners Anyone can submit a request for a larger
house or land to start a business on depending on a valid business plan
and community needs Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public
good or as needed Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and
maintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in
service to the community Companies who own many machines are to be divided
among the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid
operators on a need basis Cost of upkeep is charged A guild of heavy
machine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake Their
council is a subcouncil to the community council Etc Etc Etc It isn't
so hard to think of a better system than we have All you have to do is
realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct in fact it's a
rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could
be already The trick is to realize that the old rich have been
making the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the
merrygoround Tax the rich to death They are the ones that converted
your 's school lunch program into the joke it is today They are the ones
who always cut education They are the ones who always raise the rent when
you get a raise They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but
killed for their abuse I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a
poor kid who killed and didn't know why not I have no trouble justifying
the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed
their greed Have you paid rent most of your life Then you have been
enslaved percentage wise most of your life We used to be serfs Now we
are called renters and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own
land they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to
own it Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house
paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with
I have seen the books I know what my landlord pays and to whom I know
what I pay her I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be
let out at the other end with nothing when I had as much right as her to
live on this planet And her child will have the money to likewise
enslave my child I hope I find out when I am going to die I can make
things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she
destroyed mine And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me and
their heirs That would be worth it Then to be able to die before they can
do anything to me That's a poor man's dream Sleep tight bastard
landlords You don't know the trouble you are buying yourself as you sleep
on my heirs money in your mattress

 There is a big difference between running one's business
 affairs and actively ripping people off

 And charging homosexuals more becuase people think that AIDS is a gay
 disease is actively ripping people off 

Really  I thought that insurance companies hired all of
their actuarial staffs to determine the risks correlated
with all groups of people and that gays are more likely
to have AIDS than are those of other sexual orientations
If I am wrong about this correlation please correct me

My auto insurance company charges me up the wazoo because
I am a young male with a very high performance car  I
always thought that this was based on NHTSA and other
statistical data rather than bigotry and hatred for young
men with fast cars  Of course with the proper government
intervention we could force the insurance companies to
pretend that young men with fast cars are just the same
as everyone else

realistic figure

   As for debunking Kinsey the following article is an important
lesson for everyone to read

Was Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert
by Philip Nobile

     Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology there is a cult of
prochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a
secret sex criminal a Hoosier Dr Mengele who bent his numbers
toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the
nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids  

     But what really riles these critics is Kinsey's towerin cultural
influence  His bestselling surveys Sexual Behavior in the Human Male
 and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female  tore the
sheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury
morals  His charts and graphs based on detailed histories of 
men and women demonstrated that practices generally considered rare
andor 'abnormal' masturbation extramarital relations
homosexuality and even barnyard bestiality were as American as
strawberry shortcake  

     Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists aided and
abetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right the zoology professor
from Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex
revolution and a target for character assassination  

     Judith Reisman the prosecution's expert witness at the
Mapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati is the leader of the anti Kinsey
revisionists as well as his Inspector Javert  In  during a radio
interview with Pat Buchanan in Washington Reisman accused Kinsey of
having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of
children  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in
order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests  

     Now seven years later Reisman has revived her charges in a
different book titled Kinsey Sex and Fraud just released by the
small and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette
Louisiana  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel a Manhattan psychotherapist who
has invented a new style of intromission the coital alignment
technique that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with
considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the
sexes  In the book Eichel contends that Kinsey deliberately cooked
the gay stats because being an oddball himself he wanted to advance
the 'denormalization' of heterosexuality  

     If the authors are right then the world famous Kinsey Reports
are as the introduction boldly asserts the most egregious example
of scientific deception in this century  And if they are wrong
Kinsey Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear

     Despite the less than stellar credentials of Kinsey's
detractors legends are not what they used to be  Martin Luther King
may have committed plagiarism  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental
patients around  Father Bruce Ritter the founder of Covenant House
preyed on runaway boys  Closer to Kinsey Masters and Johnson have
been disgraced for faking it in one way or another  

     So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey who filmed strange
people having sex in his attic may have had skeletons in the closet
The problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual
prowess to pull off the job  

     As a thinker the woman is no Madame Curie  The yearold
former songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional
standing no current university position and no peerreview
publications though her creative  resume was padded with phantom
accomplishments  For instance it listed a book as her own Take Back
the Night Women on Pornography that was actually written and edited
by others  Then there is her PhD in Speech Communication from
Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University  Although Reisman has no
bachelor's degree Case granted her a master's in  and a doctorate
in   Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local
octagenarian TV commentator  But on the resume Reisman gave this
piece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker to wit The
Application of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media
Effects

     When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program it was
love at first sight for Al Regnery the outwardly anti 
porn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's
Justice Department  Regnery was a young lawandorder conservative and
amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual
climate of the United States  

     After Reisman's sensational radio session the sexual equivalent
of Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech Regnery summoned 
her to meetings to discuss mutual interests  First he tried to shovel
her  for a quasiFrankenstein study that was going to measure
the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing
photographs  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal but
 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B a probe
of child images in the cartoons Playboy Penthouse and Hust
ler  Incredibly this grant surpassed the entire budget of the
attorney general's pornography commission 

     When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 
it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department  That
spring Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New
Republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines
around the house  

     Notwithstanding the sixfigure humiliation Reisman went on to
scratch out a niche on the ioony right  As the darling of the sex
cranks she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in
men's magazines and blames AIDS on gays  Kinsey Sex and Fraud is
Reisman's latest grasp for respectability  Pat Buchanan of course is
putting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate vindication  This book
is social dynamite he says in a blurb an the front cover  He
especially liked the antigay parts  Smacking his lips in his
syndicated column he declared It may just blow the sewer cap off
Kinsey's monumental reputation reestablish homosexuality as a in
aberration expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger and even
put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr Kinsey's
'research'

     The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and
repetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sexmad pedophile who
molested little boys in Nazitype experiments and recorded their
orgasms in his male volume A similar charge was first recited at the
Fifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in  to no effect
before being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 

     Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in
Kinsey Sex and Fraud

     Mengelelike 'scientific' experiments on infants and children
were the basis for Kinsey's conclusions  on childhood sexuality

     Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project Kinsey
appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred
children aged from two months to almost  years

     This of course would implicate Kinsey and his team in
promoting and perhaps participating in the criminal activity

     In the opinion of this book's authors that is exactly how part
of Kinsey's child sexuality research took place


     Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual on
child molesters as a guide Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a
homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as
Reisman said 
 

     Kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional
positions where he had access to young boys such as YMCA  camp
counselor boys' club leader and Boy Scout leader activities he
kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers and even after his
marriage
 

     As crude as his analysis seems Eichel was more than happy to
elaborate even further in a recent phone interview  If you've ever
been around boy lovers pedophiles they are absolutely compulsive
he averred  Everything in his life is directed at getting children  I
didn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's high
school picture was a quote from Hamlet 'Man delights me not no
sic nor woman neither' What do you think they were picking up on 

     Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of
Kinsey's sex crimes something must be said about Kinsey's scientific
modus operandi  He was a fiendish collector  As a young zoologist with
a DSc  from Harvard he collected  million gall wasps and 
million related insects  When he switched to sex exploration after
agreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in  he
was no less curious or acquisitive  Nothing that mammals did in the
realm of reproduction was foreign to him  He compiled masses of erotic
materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female
johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of
mating in  species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in
oral eroticism  

     Naturally the sexual response of children the genesis of eros
fascinated him  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors
of adults without examining their origins  And so with the fervor of
his bughunting days Kinsey collected information about kids though
even his worst enemies until Reisman and Eichel refrained from
linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex  

     Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on
the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them Some of
these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or
other records which have been put at our disposal  Although he
gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the
observations of parents and nursery school teachers he treated the
documentary materia of the pedophiles as pure gold  There was nothing
like it in the literature  

     Kinsey's main source a yearold govemment worker was also
the most unforgettable character he had ever met  This man whose
history took  hours to log had sex with over  boys and  girls
as well as  of  family members including his father and
grandmother  A sexual hobbyist and passionate recordkeeper he gave
Kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent
boys  Relying on the man's meticulous research which involved
following some boys for as long as  years Kinsey was able to
identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some
of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well
as the speed and the capacity of climax  

     What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality Kinsey
had reported as fact  Children were indeed erotic beings from the
cradle  These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide
an important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a
component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy
he concluded without raising eyebrows in   

     Then along came Judith Reisman  Ignorng the legitimacy of
Kinsey's inquiry she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington  She
was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the
portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker
And she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal  

     Well was he or wasn't he Let's go to the text  There is no
evidence in Kinsey Sex and Fraud no witnesses no paper noteven a
trace of hearsay that implicates Kinsey in either planning or
partaking in child sex experiments  After  years on the trail
Reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge
 amazingly enough Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy Kinsey's
coauthor on both reports to whom Reisman has never spoken  It turns
out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume
iand in Pomeroy's  biography titled Dr Kinsey and the Institute
for Sex Research

     After frisking every the and and in both books Reisman came
up with what she believes are smoking sentences  To establish
Kinsey's alleged role in the planning she says that there is a hint
in the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey directed the
orgasm studies on kids  She cites his telltale quote from a critic of
armchair psychoanalysis demanding that writerstest their
theoriesby empirical study and statistical procedures  Then she
combines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of the
observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of
months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it
certain that true orgasm was involved  

     Putting two and two together Kinsey's empiricism and lengthy
experimentation she arrives at her hint  But realizing this dog
would not hunt she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's
supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal
involvement  As for the alleged participation after poring over
Pomeroy's biography Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting
Kinsey's likely handson approach to kiddie sex  Here the chain of
reasoning is more complex  She points out that Kinsey was interested
in clitoral measurements collecting sperm and filming sex in his
attic  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the
purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal
sex Reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply
to Kinsey's child sex experiments  Catch the may

     Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitude
toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits Kinsey
according to Pomeroy was the type of person who needed to see things
for himself  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit
Because he had not personally witnessed this event Kinsey had
difficulty in accepting its reality even on the strength of testimony
from a distinguished scientist  How then did Kinsey testify to the
actuality of orgasm in a monthold infant from the mere 'history' of
a sex offender But of course he did not he depended on their
records 

     From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides
sperm attic cumshots and climaxincottontail has Reisman defamed
the legendary Kinsey

     Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey
Institute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington  Reached by
telephone Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied
Reisman's nasty imputations  I don't understand the resistance of
people like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children Gebhard
said more in exasperation than anger  That is where sex begins  We
were happy to take data wherever we found it  Even though pedophiles
commit criminal acts they are usually not violent folks  They
wouldn't be very successful if they were  One of our best sources was
a headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club
and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students  As for
directing experiments that's absurd  We never told any of our
subjects what to do  lt was against our principles  Almost all of the
pedophile material was retrospective anyway  Nor did we ever conduct
sex experiments with children ourselves  That would have been highly
inappropriate  

     I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual
situation  I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped
her teddy bear and Kinsey watched it  

     As for Kinsey's sex life it is still shrouded in
confidentiality  He was married to the same woman for  years and
fathered four children  Apparently there are no huge sexual
revelations although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without
confirmation through the years  Gebhard took his boss's history back
in the 's but he refuses to discuss what he knows  We never
divulge anything about anybody's history whether dead or alive he
says  

     Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds
that I had once worked for Penthouse not to mention the fact that we
have been debating each other in various forums for the past five
years  In keeping with our contentious history she took a swipe at me
in her book for continuing the Kinsey practice of euphemizing
incest  My offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near
relative in a  article on the subject of incest  As a synonym for
intercourse lying with appears eight times in Genesis  

     Ed Eichel is a different story  Though seemingly obsessed by
Kinsey like his coauthor he was friendly in long conversations  He
told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he
was a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in the
early 's  It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals
he says

     Around  Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey and
the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was
ruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the
heterosexual norm  No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting
the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual
compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections

     Eventually Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman
and from this union Kinsey Sex and Fraud was born  Eichel's main
contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey
conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as
the balanced sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people which
by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual
behavior would open the way for the second and more difficult step
the ultimate goal of crossgenerational sex sex with children  

     When I pressed him for specific references to back up his
outrageous contentions he said weakly You don't think Kinsey is
going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual
and should have sex with kids but this is implicit in the Kinsey
reports  

     Meanwhile Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of
Kinsey and his data  Perfect  That's just what the country needs a
House UnAmerican Sexual Activities Committee looking under beds and
asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader a sympathizer
or God forbid a subject of Dr Alfred Kinsey

Such a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions
with the result of the police trying to take the place by
force and the result being the death of the hostages and the
gunmen However this is the first time I've heard of
the blame landing squarely on the police
 
In this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down
from terrorists and hostage takers since that only encourages
other terrorists and hostage takers
 
Richard

That people are at risk and that some die during a hostage situation might
be considered an acceptable scenario in storming a compound 

When EVERYONE dies save for nine people including twenty children the 
outcome must be considered a failure

Now was the failure due to unforseeable circumstances incompetence or
negligence  From the double talk and multiple stories I've seen on the news
coming from the FBI and Reno I find it was an honest mistake hard to swallow

Let's hope they get their stories straight for the second round of questions

 We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of
 their rights to worship and bear arms

 Arms Automatic weapons grenades rocket launchers The sorts of things
 no family should be without I guess

All government claims  If they were really stocking such weapons for
Armageddon how come they never used them

 Anyway I've often wondered what
 business followers of Christ would have with weapons It's hard to imagine a
 pistolpackin' Jesus though I suppose a pumpaction shotgun would have
 made clearing the temple a hell of a lot easier

The time is coming  Those of you who have no sword sell your shirt and
 buy one And they told him Master we have two swords  And he said It 
 is enough  LUKE 

Think not that I am come to send peace on earth I came not to send peace
 but the sword For I am come to set a man at variance against his father
 and the daugher against her mother  MATT  

 Well when the nice federal officers come to my house to check out my
 extensive weapons cache I'll just be sure not to shoot at them
 Tea ladies and gentlemen

Just maybe you won't be home  Then you can come home to something 
like this

    Well it's been a rough month begins Johnnie Lawmaster  I
 just get laid off and my divorce became final  But I just wasn't
 ready for what happened this particular Monday

    That particular Monday was was December  the first day of the
 Bill of Rights' third century the day when federal agents and local
 law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew
 the US flag  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak
 afternoon one of his neighbors had some news

    'Ohmigod John you are in big trouble' my neighbor tells me
 'Sixty police federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house
 kicked down the door cut locks off your gun safe'  I couldn't
 believe it  Then I walked inside  What a nightmare

    It was no nightmare it was horribly real life  Apparently acting
 on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm some thirty
 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms BATF teamed up
 with state and Tulsa police authorities search warrant in hand to
 search for a Colt AR  caliber machine gun unknown serial
 number  The warrant issued by US Magistrate John Leo Wagner also
 authorized agents to seize any tools used in the alteration or
 modification of firearms such as files or drills documents papers
 books records and other tangible properties which identify occupants
 or owners of the property to be searched

    Reports vary but according to neighbors the joint task force
 operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital
 involved some  agents and local law enforcement personnel against
 Lawmaster  They cordoned off the street took station with weapons
 drawn in the back yard used a battering ram to break through the
 front door kicked in the back door broke into his gun safe threw
 personal papers around the house spilled boxes of ammunition on the
 floor broke into a small locked box that contained precious coins
 stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles breaking the table
 in the process  Then they left  The doors were closed but not
 latched much less locked  The ammo and guns were left unsecured

    My front and back doors were pulled shut but they were busted
 through and couldn't latch  Anybody could have waltzed in there and
 stolen everything I own  A child could have taken a gun  The guns
 the safe  everything was open and laying around  I keep all my
 magazines empty but someone had loaded them  While I was looking
 around in amazement the gas electric and water companies show up to
 turn the power off  They said they were told to shut things down
 Then I found the note  Nothing Found  ATF

    They didn't make any attempt to notify me  I've lived in Tulsa
 all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket  How come they
 can't look that up realize I've been lawabiding my whole life then
 come to the door when I'm home  They didn't leave someone here to
 watch over my private property  They didn't even come by to explain
 what happened  They just raided my home ransaked it left it wide
 open and left

    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent  I asked
 'Are you gonna' arrest me' and he said 'No'  I asken him Who is
 going to repair and clean up my house'  And he said If you're going
 to talk to me come down to my office'

    'I can't come down' I said  'My doors are broken'  If I had
 been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors I would have
 lost everything I own  Here I am a competent responsible firearms
 owner and the government leaves them open unlocked with ammo strewn
 around

    Lawmaster said the agent advised him If you want your door to
 lock and your gun safe to lock you're gonna' have to pay for it
 yourself

    'Oh I'll come right down alright' I told him  'I'll come
 down but I'll bring my attorney'  And he said 'Well you bring
 your attorney and we won't talk to you'


So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence make
sure your lawyer isn't there there's a good chap


 It's very sad all those people died especially the kids but that's going
 to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up
 with a charismatic nutcase

What a repulsive outlook on society  Followers of unusual religions
may be killed by the government  it simply can't be helped in a free
society

You and I have two different concepts of free

 Well the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
 if the oppertunity presented itself

 I reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
 huge variety of willing partners

If true and if gays were the same as straights except
for sexual preference I would imagine that gays would
have much less sex than straights because the available
pool for dates is less than onetenth what it is for
straights  Somebody correct flame me please

I cannot believe I am posting in this thread but what
the hell he asked for it

I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing
I was bi  So what  of everyone else is straight I'd never
end up with a guy anyway  As several people on socbi pointed
out to me this is true only if you find partners for relationships
or just for sex in primarily straight circles  Nowadays with gay
culture quite visible in major cities and such you can easily
find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so
choose  About half my friends are bi and that's just from
hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a
week it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in
bars or something

So the available pool for dates can be the same size  Unless of
course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population

As for promiscuity I've traded email with Clayton on the topic
and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes gay males
are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're
closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship
Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messedup gender
roles in our society and when males are dating males and they've
all been trained to be the aggressor in sex there's going to
be more sex  Or that what's dysfunctional what's screwed up
is societal attitudes not gay sexuality and that's what 
encourages deviant behavior in gay males

also note that just because someone's had  sex partners 
doesn't mean they're promiscuous  yes it sounds ridiculous
but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily
closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with
strangers and then come out start forming real relationships
and be monogamous or nearly so

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                             April       

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
            IN QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WITH THE PRESS 


                           The Rose Garden


 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  On February the th four federal 
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law 
against the Branch Davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled 
weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk  
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective a day 
standoff ensued  
	     
	     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every 
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without 
bloodshed and further loss of life  The Bureau's efforts were 
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were 
dealing David Koresh was dangerous irrational and probably 
insane      

	     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both 
federal law and common standards of decency  He was moreover 
responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the 
action against the compound in February  Given his inclination 
towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no 
provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal 
agents against the compound  
	     
	     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on 
an operation prepared by the FBI designed to increase pressure on 
Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully  
The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even 
in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause 
permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people 
in the compound to come outside and to surrender
	     
	     I was informed of the plan to end the siege  I 
discussed it with Attorney General Reno  I asked the questions I 
thought it was appropriate for me to ask  I then told her to do what 
she thought was right and I take full responsibility for the 
implementation of the decision  
	     
	     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy  
Mr Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal 
agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his 
captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not 
survive  He killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate 
responsibility for the carnage that ensued
	     
	     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the 
future  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and 
Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to 
uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been 
done differently  I have told the departments to involve independent 
professional law enforcement officials in the investigation  I 
expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required 
to complete the review  Finally I have directed the departments to 
cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can 
continue to be fully accountable to the American people
	     
	     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney 
General to the Justice Department and to the federal agents on the 
front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult 
circumstances  
	     
	     Again I want to say as I did yesterday I am very sorry 
for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end 
of this tragedy in Waco  I hope very much that others who will be 
tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David 
Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over 
the last seven weeks  And I hope very much that the difficult 
situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will 
be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future 
will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what 
has been learned now
	     
	     Q	  Mr President can you first of all tell us why 
after  days you decided 
	     
	     Q	  Mr President can you describe for us what it is 
that Janet Reno outlined to you in your minute phone conversation 
with 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I can't hear you both  If one will go 
first and then the other
	     
	     Q	  Sorry  Can you describe what Janet Reno 
	     
	     Q	  Mr President 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I'll answer both your questions but I 
can't do it at once
	     
	     Q	  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about 
the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Yes  I was told by the Attorney General 
that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another 
step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound  And she 
described generally what the operation would be  that they wanted 
to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause 
permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it 
very difficult for people to stay inside the building  And it was 
hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside  
	     
	     I was further told that under no circumstances would our 
people fire any shots at them even if fired upon  They were going to 
shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and 
there would be no exchange of fire  In fact as you know an awful 
lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials  
There were no shots coming back from the government side
	     
	     I asked a number of questions  The first question I 
asked is why now  We have waited seven weeks why now  The reasons 
I was given were the following
	     
	     Number one that there was a limit to how long the 
federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the 
quality and intensity of coverage by experts there  They might be 
needed in other parts of the country
	     
	     Number two that the people who had reviewed this had 
never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced 
that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to 
be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult 
members to come out  
	     
	     Number three that the danger of their doing something 
to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with 
the passage of time
	     
	     And number four that they had reason to believe that 
the children who were still inside the compound were being abused 
significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and 
unsafe conditions
	     
	     So for those reasons they wanted to move at that time  
The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had 
given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and 
evaluated them against what might happen that was good  She said 
that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were 
convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only 
increase with the passage of time
	     
	     The third question I asked was has the military been 
consulted  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco 
that's the first thing I asked to be done because it was obvious 
that this was not a typical law enforcement situation  Military 
people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some 
of the problems that were presented by it   And so I asked if the 
military had been consulted  The Attorney General said that they 
had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one 
minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military 
 something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming 
significance
	     
	     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers I 
said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she 
should proceed and that I would support it  And I stand by that 
today
	     
	     Q	  Mr President 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Wait  Go ahead
	     
	     Q	  Can you address the widespread perception 
reported widely television radio and newspapers  that you were 
trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  No I'm bewildered by it  The only 
reason I made no public statement yesterday  let me say  the only 
reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to 
add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather 
late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who 
had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into 
custody  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events 
to unfold  
	     
	     There was  I have  I can't account for why people 
speculated one way or the other but I talked to the Attorney General 
on the day before the action took place  I talked to her yesterday  
I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry 
King Show and I talked to her again this morning  A President  it 
is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that 
happen when the federal government is in control
	     
	     I will say this however  I was frankly surprised 
would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the 
Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics 
murdered themselves  Applause  
	     
	     I regret what happened but it is not possible in this 
life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance  These 
people killed four federal officials in the line of duty  They were 
heavily armed  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly 
and they were never fired back on  We did everything we could to 
avoid the loss of life  They made the decision to immolate 
themselves  And I regret it terribly and I feel awful about the 
children  
	     
	     But in the end the last comment I had from Janet Reno 
is when  and I talked to her on Sunday  I said now I want you 
to tell me once more why you believe  not why they believe  why 
you believe we should move now rather than wait some more  And she 
said it's because of the children  They have evidence that those 
children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly 
unsafe conditions and that they don't think it will get any easier 
with time  with the passage of time  I have to take their word for 
that  So that is where I think things stand
	     
	     Q	  Can we assume then that you don't think this was 
mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn't run out of 
patience  And if you had it to do over again would you really 
decide that way
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  No  well I think what you can assume 
is just exactly what I announced today  This is a  the FBI has 
done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of 
time  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the 
World Trade Center in licketysplit record time  We want an inquiry 
to analyze the steps along the way  Is there something else we 
should have known  Is there some other question they should have 
asked  Is there some other question I should have asked  Can I say 
for sure that no one  that we could have done nothing else to make 
the outcome come different  I don't know that  That's why I want 
the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have 
some independent law enforcement people not political people but 
totally nonpolitical outside experts who can bring to bear the best 
evidence we have  
	     
	     There is unfortunately a rise in this sort of 
fanaticism all across the world  And we may have to confront it 
again  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do 
particularly when there are children involved  But I do think it is 
important to recognize that the wrongdoers in this case were the 
people who killed others and then killed themselves
	     
	     Q	  Mr President were there any other options 
presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from 
February th until yesterday
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well yes I got regular reports all 
along the way  There were lots of other options pursued  If you go 
back  you all covered it very well  The FBI  you did a very good 
job of it  I mean the FBI and the other authorities there pursued 
any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them 
early on seemed to be working  Some of the children got out some of 
the other people left  There was a  at one point there seemed to 
be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the 
authorities  And then he would say things and not do them and things 
just began to spin downward  
	     
	     Whether there were other  in terms of what happened 
yesterday the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not 
involve other options except whether we should take more time with 
the present strategy we were pursuing  because they said they 
wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get 
people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves  
That's what they thought
	     
	     Q	  Did the government know that the children did not 
have gas masks
	     
	     Q	     congressional hearings once the situation  are 
you in agreement with that
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  That's up to the Congress  They can do 
whatever they want  But I think it's very important that the 
Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring 
in some outside experts  And as I said in my statement if any 
congressional committees want to look into it we will fully 
cooperate  There is nothing to hide here  This was probably the 
most wellcovered operation of its kind in the history of the 
country
	     
	     Go ahead Sarah
	     
	     Q	  There are two questions I want to ask you  The 
first is I think that they knew very well that the children did not 
have gas masks while the adults did so the children had no chance 
because this gas was very  she said it was not lethal but it was 
very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived 
without gas masks  And on February th  let's go back  didn't 
those people have a right to practice their religion
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  They were not just practicing their 
religion they were  the Treasury Department believed that they had 
violated federal laws any number of them
	     
	     Q	  What federal laws 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Let me go back and answer  I can't 
answer the question about the gas masks except to tell you that the 
whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested they 
were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but 
it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside  And one of 
the things that I've heard  I don't want to get into the details of 
this because I don't know  but one of the things that they were 
speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that 
the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have 
escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect  
	     
	     They also knew Sarah that there was an underground 
compound  a bus buried underground where the children could be 
sent  And they were  I think they were hoping very much that if 
the children were not released immediately outside that the humane 
thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace 
where they could be protected  
	     
	     In terms of the gas masks themselves I learned 
yesterday  I did not ask this fact question before  that the gas 
was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks 
themselves were to work  So that it was thought that even if they 
all had gas masks that eventually the gas would force them out in a 
nonviolent nonshooting circumstance
	     
	     MS MYERS  Last question
	     
	     Q	  Mr President why are you still saying that 
	     
	     Q	  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked 
Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide  And when you 
learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your 
mind during those horrendous moments
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had 
considered all the worse things that could happen  And she said 
and of course the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the 
public  he had  that had been debated anyway  And she said that 
the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues 
concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would 
be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in 
the future  That was the judgment they made  Whether they were 
right or wrong of course we will never know 
	     
	     What happened when I saw the fire when I saw the 
building burning  I was sick  I felt terrible  And my immediate 
concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were 
escaping or whether they were inside trying to burn themselves up  
That's the first thing I wanted to know  
	     
	     Thank you
	     
	     Q	  Mr President why are you still saying it was a 
Janet Reno decision  Isn't it in the end your decision
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well what I'm saying is that I didn't 
have a four or fivehour detailed briefing from the FBI  I didn't 
go over every strategic part of it  It is a decision for which I 
take responsibility  I'm the President of the United States and I 
signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to 
make the last call  When I talked to her on Sunday some time had 
elapsed  She might have made a decision to change her mind  I said 
if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow I will support you 
And I do support her  
	     
	     She is not ultimately responsible to the American 
people I am  But I think she has conducted her duties in an 
appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as 
well as she could have  
	     
	     Thank you  Applause

 What is SO supposed to signify  I prefer the companionship of a

  because if she heard
 
 Thankfully you got the gender right  For I am not a deviant

WOW  Another Clayton wannabe  Typical response lack of logic

Define 'deviant'  someone who deviates from the normal  Ok so far
Define 'normal'   erm umm  If you define yourself as normal then it is for
you to prove that you are within limits which then brings in the question
what are the limits  For you we may have to broaden them to other's intolerance
  'normal'  Difficult to prove  From what you have posted it must follow
that normal to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice
But it does look as if you went to the Clayton school of logic doesn't it

 
  how disparaging you are towards political minorities
 
 Sexual deviants do not comprise a political minority

Again an astounding lack of logic  Wow

You must define what you say such that everyone agrees  Here you have used
the phrase sexual deviant  How in the hell do you define that  As someone
who does something sexually that you don't  By this definition you most
probably mean the majority of the planet  How do you know that your next
door neighbour doesn't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then
have it licked off by his wife  Is this sexual deviancy  How do we know
that you don't like something sexually which others may find repulsive  Is 
having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy  Please be more specific and
where you do back up your claims  Or I may have to go to hospital due to
laughing too much at yours and Clayton's postings

Secondly if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' means
such people as homosexuals bisexuals c basically everyone you don't like
I think that your phrase do not comprise a political minority why the
brackets is a nonsequiteur  Gay groups exist which lobby their governments
That is a fact  Prove it false  Hence they are a politial group  You 
state that they are not a political minority  Are they therefore a
political majority  I think you boobed really big on this one  Try thinking
about your arguments

 
  and if she had any shred of selfrespect she'd be out the door
 
 I only associate with girls who do indeed have selfrespect  But were
 I to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the
 door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as
 homosexuality I would encourage her to indeed do so and I would
 further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on
 the way out  Who needs such an airhead


Prove the first statement please   Dates phone numbers c

Again your logic fails  Again you make statements which you cannot
and most probably will not maintain

You state that a person girl in this context who considers equal rights
for all humans to be an airhead  As Clayton your best mate would say
it just shows how screwed up you are

 
  Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
  where they belong
 
  Don't count on it sweetheart
 
 Oh I can't do anything BUT count on it  After all it is
 inevitable for it is part of the natural order of things  Throughout
 history nature has always asserted itself  Don't be so arrogant as
 to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the
 nature of man where practically every other generation has failed
 Greater men than you haven't been able to do this  The above MOST
 CERTAINLY WILL happen no matter how much you may wish to pretend
 otherwise

Proof please  Proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order
Proof that nature has always asserted itself  Are you saying that nature
is a conciousness  Are you pretending that you have the ability to see the
future  Are you godtm  In fact by your arguement are you waiting for 
the black people to become slaves again  Because they were reviled as
subhuman nb not my view at one time  Again your arguement falls
on its ass


 
 Moreover I'm not your sweetheart

Touchy touchy touchy

Right  I have shot holes in each and every one of your arguements  You are
most probably going to put me in your kill file because you have no answers
to my questions and challenges  Since you cannot support your arguments it
merely goes to show that what you write is based upon your personal prejudices
and cannot be taken to be fact of any kind

A very well put together post I disagree with several key points but the
post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse

    There has been much discussion recently about the right to
    freedom of association Mr Cramer and Mr Ronzone appear to
    take an absolutist position on this rightthat it is a
    fundamental human right perhaps the fundamental human right
    and that it supersedes other rights such as the right to an
    equal opportunity Others feel that a right to an equal
    opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association
    and thus we have the neverending debate that flares up
    repeatedly

Freedom of Association FOA involves the MUTUAL and VOLUNTARY agreement of
two or more people

Right to Equal Opportunity lets call it REO involves coercion in all cases
by definition


    A major problem is that neither of these rights are
    explicitly declared or protected in the Constitution or in
    the Declaration of Independence although both can be derived
    from these documents Unfortunately this means that the
    debate will never end because neither side can conclu
    sively prove the validity of their viewit becomes solely a
    matter of personal philosophy

Yes there is much debate But no it can end with once and for all
recognition of these rights Well not totally  perfect end but end
in the same way that there is no worldwide disagreement that say murder is
a crime


    My personal opinion is that the real answer lies somewhere in
    between I regard both of these rights as fundamental human
    rights which unfortu nately come into direct conflict with
    one another Which is stronger depends on the given
    situation

Hmm there is even MORE discusion about religion Should  we take a 
somewhere in between approach towards the State  a State recognized
religion The first amendment is so uh so absolutist you know

    For example if the owner of a momandpop store wishes to
    hire an employee to help out their right to freedom of
    association outweighs the rights of their job applicants to
    an equal opportunity They should be free to hire whomever
    they choose using whatever criteria they choose without any
    government intervention at all
    
    Similarly if a family wishes to rent out a bedroom in their
    home or a garage apartment or something similar then their
    right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their
    prospective tenants to an equal opportunity
    
    If on the other hand IBM a multinational corporation with
     employees publicly owned and operated by a board of
    directors wishes to hire additional employees then whose
    freedom of association are we protecting The board of
    directors The other employees The owners of the stock In
    this case the applicant's right to an equal opportunity
    outweighs the right to freedom of association and we as a
    society can ask IBM to use only those criteria which are
    relevant to the specific task

Why Says who Why can mon  pop have FOA but IBM be forced and force is
the correct word here to have REO As purchase of IBM is voluntary then
there are very well defined procedures on how IBM chooses to do some things
and chooses to do other things Why not let those same procedures work for
employment policies


    Similarly if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings
    in which he does not live and which are managed by an
    independent management agency then whose freedom of
    association are we protecting If the owner does not live in
    his buildings and has no contact with his tenants then the
    prospective tenant's right to an equal opportunity outweighs
    the right to freedom of association and we as a society
    can ask the owner to use only those criteria which are
    relevant to good tenants I've put good in quotation
    marks because I really don't want to be drawn off into the
    side issue of what constitutes a good tenant

Why does this tenant have an option I won't call it a right to destroy
the FOA of the landlord If the landlord and the tenant can't agree then they
both can cease from using each other's property

Suddenly by arm waving by magic a landlord does not have FOA And on what
basis does the FOA of the landlord disappear

It seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice

Well I think FOA is one our most important rightts in the top  and by
golly if the State is going to make it suffer I sure would like to see the
heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right

I don't think no contact with the tenats is even a crime much less something
that should cause severe interference with important rights

    I suspect that the majority of the people in this country
    agree with my position on these extreme cases particularly
    if they are presented in this manner I don't know if Mr
    Ronzone or Mr Cramer would agreeI suspect not In any
    case additional problems arise when we try to apply
    guidelines for the middle ground What if the company has 
    employees or  or  Where do we draw the line between
    protecting the right to freedom of association and protecting
    the right to an equal opportunity

Rights are not defined by majoritymob choice FOA is an absolute REO
is a fancy name for thuggery for racism and coercion

    The difficulty is that any line we draw will of necessity
    be artificial And any legislation resulting will be flawed
    In the past the government has usually tried to pass laws
    which referred to the number of employees hired by the
    companyeg any company with more than xxx employees was
    affected by the law Those with fewer were unaffected

Of course it would be You dimly see that the line must be artifiacial because
FOA is the only right Just like a State religion  you can't jsutify that
either

    Generally I believe that if we do not have any regulations
    affecting these rights then the right to freedom of
    association will be stronger On the other hand many of the
    regulations protect the right to an equal opportunity too
    much weakening the right to freedom of association
    
    I don't believe there is a satisfactory solution which will
    please everybody A solution that I came up with is to use
    publicly owned vs privately owned as the dividing line If
    the company remains privately owned then the owners should
    be free to do whatever they want with their company If the
    company becomes publicly owned then the public has a right
    to ask the company to submit to additional regulation

Why I assume that when you say publicly owned you are talking about those
quasiState companys that do NOT have shareholders

The companies on the Fortune  for example are all privately owned They
can give you a list of all of their owners They have no anonymous
unknown to them owners


    By the way the above analysis is based on the assumption
    that the right to freedom of association and the right to an
    equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal
    importance Since this is entirely a matter of faith not
    subject to any proof I do not choose to even try to
    establish this You either accept it or you don't
    
    Any comments

FOA can be derived by any two rational people on a basis that neither has
evil malicious or murderous intent towards the others

In short agreement is mutual or not at all

Your REO on the other hand lives only by accepting coercion the gun into
the situation And that is selfdestructive of the whole argument because it
is based only on might makes right Sort of like saying nobody has a right
to live whereupon I whip out a gun and shoot you dead  end of argument


 
There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster Weird eh

These opinions are MINE and you can't have 'em But I'll rent 'em cheap

You're not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one 
insurance plan
 
No it is optional  as it is optional for doctors to accept it
There are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for
exemptions and one email from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton
verified for me that it is indeed negative option  I guess that you
can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but
so far I've not come across that up north  and I take pains to keep
tabs with news from home

It's optional but what if you don't want basic coverage on the 
government's terms You said before that if you opt out you're 
basically uninsured

There are two things at work here  the public insurance is very
wide in what it will cover as the amortization is also universal
No private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve 
and as our private sector has discovered they're better off not
offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use


And that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an
effective cartelthey don't really need to compete because as you put
it they're in a winwin situation and they're guaranteed to turn a
profit 
 
Believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out  And
according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to
the point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce luncheons

So in a sense they've stopped being truly capitalists if they don't 
have to worry about competing anymore You might say that the total 
effect is one of socialized medicinea government providing the basics 
and a cartel providing the extras There is no alternative to the system 
desirable or not

The alternative to the system is no system at all patients opted out
doctors opted out or both  But that only for insurance  and you
can't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they
will not offer  And remember that the actual health care is delivered
by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily
Again they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them

Plus there is the matter of culture and values  I'm basically
antitax and antigovernment by Canadian standards  yet I can't
bring myself to make the same arguments as you do despite that I
understand where you're coming from  Up north you're so much more
likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health
insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage 

Interesting side notehave any new insurance companies started
upfrom scratchsince Medicare became standard in Canada
 
I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I 
no scratch that  there are a few in Western Canada and quite 
a few in Quebec as part of the post Quebec Miracle out with the
nationalism in with the French capitalism  La Groupe des Cooper
antes built a new tower by the Eaton's store at Les Terraces and if
you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as
the welllit one with doubleturrets at the top  As for Ontario
which still dominates and anchors business up north 

I meant new companies not new buildings

Yes primarily in Quebec and in Alberta  Sorry I musta lost you in
that verbose blurb 

It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives
 
Well you have to realize that in our society that's like saying
that it's not really national defence because you can't hire
your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist

True but I would be more comfortable with a system in which basic 
care provided by the government was optional not mandatory

In Canada and Germany it's not mandatory  However it is negative
option in that you must request the exemption  That the private
sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option
as in the Quebec case tells me something about what they know 

Either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the
changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower
rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of
disasters eg Chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart
disease A doctor needs  years of training plus internship 
and specialty training

Another problem with the US system that should be resolved Doesn't 
Canada have something like ten times the proportion of GPs to specialists 
that the US does

Yes but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are
too small to sustain many specialists sometimes not even one so
you pretty well have to be a GP to get paid  And if you do get
the training the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a
licence because there is already someone in the business and who
cannot fill hisher appointment book  That we have a CMA doctors
monopoly is something that the American AMAoriented medical lobby
NEVER tells you down here 

The problem is in a specialty your skill often directly correlates
to your pay a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate
cardiologist more than it does in general practice In that
circumstance it's hard to blame people for going into specialties

No I respect people who do specialties okay all of my MD friends
are  but there's the question of our small market dynamics up
north  if anything that our private doctors and hospitals sell
their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate
their effective population served and thus make some specialties
finally viable ie there will be enough customers  We just do
not have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise

I personally think an approach like Germany's would be bestwhere the
companies compete for batches of people Rochester a little east of
us was able to get almost all of its population covered that way

Uh  Germany basically uses our method with their many sickness
funds  The competition is fake if it exists at all because they're
all interlinked  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern my girlfriend is in
our German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in
Saarbrucken  no ads for health insurance  While Canada organizes
by province Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations
and regional offices   But remember that we have provinces that have
the same population as some major German corporations  Germans have
public health insurance just that it is brokered by smaller entities
actually brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra
insurance to fill out their policies sort of a voucher system
was one of the first ideas floated in Canada too

Remember the Germans don't have HMO's  a telling sign 'cos
Rochester does and they're also a company town

But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said
Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs which require
spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches Mickey Kaus
in the New Republic probably spoke for most Americans when he said
Who needs that I think people here generally like to believe they
can easily get the most hightech treatment even if they really can't
afford it

I'll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim but
I've come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about
our system  If much or some of it were true you'd have to take
us for idiots for tolerating it  And given that our insurance was
installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory
governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still
chafing they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
things  think about it  After all we are using the US as a
metric to make comparison  both for keepingupwiththeJoneses
as for confirming that we did something right

We're Number One in percentage of population without health insurance 


The main reason we're Number One in  percentage of population without
health  insurance  is  that we're last  in  percentage  of  population
covered  by public health insurance Only about one fifth of Americans
qualify for the main types of public health insurance available in the
United States Medicare Medicaid and veterans' benefitsl

Of those  who don't  qualify many  have private  insurance  But
almost  one  in  seven  Americans    million peoplemost living in
families with a working adult have  no insurance  at  all and one in
four  million have been without insurance for a substantial period
of time during the last two years Many more have inadequate coverage
meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness In fact
one  health  care  expert  says that because  only   percent  of  the
population  has   private   longtermcare  insurance  virtually  any
American could be  impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness
Additionally as many as   percent of those  eligible for some forms
of public aid do not  receive  it These  gaps in health  care  result
directly from  the  fact  that  the  United  States is  the only major
industrialized  nation other than  South Africa without  a  national
health insurance  plan providing  universal coverage while controlling
costs

   THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE

                         by Theodore J O'Keefe


HARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT within clear view of the Jefferson
Memorial an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial
has arisen on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of
America a costly and dangerous mistake  On ground where no monument yet
marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all
races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation sits today a
massive and costly edifice devoted above all to a contentious and false
version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II of nonAmerican
members of a minority sectarian group  Now in the deceptive guise of
tolerance the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda
campaign financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer
in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America

     How did the federal government allow the creation of such a
monstrosity  What is its meaning for American policy and for American
values  And what must the American people do to regain control of the land
their servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and to
establish an enterprise thereon whether a museum or otherwise informed by
and conducted according to American principles and interests

Photograph captioned The fivestory  million US Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington DC was built and is operated by a taxpayerfunded
federal agency  In the foreground is the museum's sixsided Hall of
Remembrance


ORIGINS

     In the late s during the presidency of James Earl Jimmy Carter
a propaganda campaign to promote the Holocaust the alleged systematic
slaughter of some  million Jews by the Germans during World War II was
organized and carried out from Hollywood and New York As Benjamin Meed an
important functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum
wrote in 
              

          Almost a dozen years ago a new phenomena sic developed  The
     Holocaust was introduced into schools colleges and universities
     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of
     Americans watched them  Soon Americans took great interest in the
     lessons of the Holocaust its uniqueness and its universal message


     Why the urgency of this campaign Two factors were paramount  first
the beginnings more than three decades after the end of World War II of
an objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policy
to exterminate European Jewry

     Second the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face of
unprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence including
the famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism with
racism and to defend Israel's aggressive policy under the leadership of
the former terrorist Prime Minister Menachem Begin


THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL

     In  President Carter his administration beleaguered at home and
abroad succumbed to pressure from the new Holocaust lobby and thus
America's influential Israelfirst minority by creating through executive
order the President's Commission on the Holocaust  Two years later on
October   Congress passedunanimouslya law establishing the
United States Holocaust Memorial Council charged principally with
constructing and overseeing the operation of a permanent living memorial
to the victims of the holocaust and with providing for appropriate ways
for the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance as an annual
national civic commemoration of the Holocaust

     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council and
after years of costly delay during which the US Holocaust Memorial
Council's budget swelled from  million to over  million a year the
US Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for opening
on April  


A SECTARIAN ALIEN AGENDA

     The Holocaust Memorial Council besides soliciting tens of millions of
dollars in taxdeductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum has
busied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority
Zionist ends

     The membership of the council a US federal agency has been
overwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in   The council's two
different chairmenElie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoffhave both been
committed to the support of the state of Israel and the chairs of the
council's most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist

     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum Miles Lerman was
formerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization
promoting taxfree investment in a country which receives by far the
largest amount of US foreign aid per year  Working the same wealthy
Jewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel
Lerman has helped raise nearly  million in taxdeductible
contributions  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having various
components of the museum named for them eg the Wexler Learning Center

     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the only
function with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged
Another of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victims
of the Holocaust which Congress has raised to an annual national civic
commemoration of the Holocaust  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah Day of the
Holocaust on which they are based the Days of Remembrance are dated
according to the lunar Hebrew calendar and thus like Passover or Chanukah
fluctuate from year to year These foreign days of lamentation are
currently celebrated under the flag of the republic to prayers and chants
in Hebrew in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls
across the land  Need it be stated that no group of American victims of
persecution let alone another foreign group enjoys any such federally
mandated and taxsupported day or days of recognition


THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM'S ONESIDED HISTORY

     Although the US Holocaust Memorial Council during its early years
made noises about recognizing the ordeals of nonJews during World War II
by every indication from advance literature published by the council the
US Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric  While
according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit here and
there are nods to nonJewish groups oppressed by the German National
Socialists never to groups victimized by Germany's enemies above all by
Stalin's USSR the larger holocaust of World War II which claimed an
estimated  to  million lives around the world is ignored in preference
to the Jewish ordeal Thus to cite just one telling example the museum's
Life before the Holocaust exhibit refers strictly to Jewish life before
the Holocaust

     Where in fact nonJews figure in the Museum they figure largely as
villains the Germans and their allies and collaborators the Western
Allies including America who refused to accept a large immigration before
the war the American political and military leaders who refused to
authorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz gas chambers

        
RED LIBERATORS

     The museum's message that support for Jews is the sole measure of
decency during World War II leads to anomalies which in an American museum
raised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which this
republic is based can only be called shocking  That the victims of World
War II atrocities by the Alliesmassacres such as the firebombing of
Tokyo and Dresden the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Soviet
slaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn the mass rapes carried out by
the Red Army at the war's endreceive no mention is deplorable  But the
museum's treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin's savage
Soviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque

     In the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Communists appear only in the
guise of resistance fighters and liberators  For example the
submachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg a Communist Party
member who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in North
France are on honored display no less precious a relic than the standard
heaps of shoes and hair in the museum's permanent exhibit

     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin's notorious Red
Army which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities across
Europe during and after the war  As the US Holocaust Memorial
Council's newsletter fulsomely puts it Flags will hang in the museum to
honor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward and
who were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence of
the camps  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff these
martial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association Much more
than simply wartime memorabilia these military artifacts are a significant
contribution to memory one that will remind future generations of the
pivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism

     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from the
European nationsRussia Ukraine Belarus Estonia Latvia Lithuania
Poland Hungary Czechoslovakia Romania Bulgaria former Yugoslavia
for which the Red military artifacts symbolized invasion tyranny
oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armies
of their persecutors hailed as liberators


ISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM

     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum's
director Yeshayahu Weinberg and the head of its Learning Center
Yechiam Halevy were brought in from Israel the museum's treatment of the
state of Israel is adulatory  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israel
is an integral part of the exhibition  That the establishment of Israel
and its expansion in subsequent wars has meant colonial occupation and
oppression for millions of the land's native Palestinians and
dispossession and exile for millions more goes unmentionedanother
grotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers of
intolerance and disregard of human rights  As for the momentous
collaboration between Hitler's German state and the Jewish Agency in the
s which through the Ha'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vital
capital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewish
immigrants to Palestine that is passed over in utter silence


HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS

     The Holocaust Museum's skewed history is not simply a matter of one
sidedness and omission  The museum has further committed itself to a fixed
and final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspect
evidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry largely in gas
chambers in numbers approaching  million  This despite a considerable
body of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decades
in many lands and which contests by academic means the substance of the
Holocaust extermination thesis

     That the US Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of the
revisionists is clear The council's literature is replete not with
substantive refutations of revisionist scholarship but with slander and
polemic  To cite one characteristic example the US Holocaust Memorial
Museum Newsletter of May  featured a frontpage attack on Holocaust
revisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in which
the author decried the revisionists for producing material that looked
scholarly then lauded the US Holocaust Memorial Museum as among the
most efficacious ways of combating this pernicious trend while
neglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship

     The US Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is a
historical debate on the holocaust but takes official notice of the
dissenting position only to attack it  That an American institution
supported by the taxes of all Americans should commit itself to inflexible
historical orthodoxyin the service of a single American minorityis an
intolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights as well as a mockery
of the Western and American ideal of objective scholarship


A CENTER FOR EDUCATION

     US Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated
The museum is primarily an educational institution  From the
council's own literature however it is clear what Meyerhoff means by
education  The roleplaying for children as well as adults who visit the
museum visitors are to be issued identity cards bearing the name and
alleged fate of various Holocaust victims the hightech computer and
video effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment the
museum's tendentiously described artifacts and the museum's goal as
proclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman Miles Lerman of ensuring
that Children in Dubuque families in Tucson and schoolteachers in
Atlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughly
as they learn the history of their own communitiesall these show that
the US Holocaust Memorial Museum is a propaganda enterprise that seeks
to indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish and
Zionist version of not merely the past but the present and the
future


THE AMERICAN RESPONSE

     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in a
place solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic to
be lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when even in our
country's capital thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our national
monuments  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agenda
that aims to impose a sectarian Holocaust remembrance in schools where
our children cannot pray in town halls and federal buildings from which
the religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom of
worship

     Over two centuries ago Thomas Jefferson wrote To compel a man to
furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he
disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical

     Nearly  years ago Abraham Lincoln said I insist that if there is
anything which it is the duty of the whole people to never entrust to
any hands but their own that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of
their own liberties and institutions

     The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the council which runs it as
agencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign must
be removed from the special interest that now controls it

     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded from its present
onesided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings real and imagined in
Europe during the s and s to a compassionate yet realistic concern
for all victims but above all for American victims of historic
injustice

     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage and
scholars of every viewpoint may gather educate and be educated without
accusation and in the absence of propaganda  Until it is the men and
women who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America
of every race nationality and creed will rest uneasy

My apologies I really didn't have the time to chase down a slew of
references from  years ago when I was looking at these issues
The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city
Despite some pious legends the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
especially after centuries of political instability and terror the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of When studied with
a
knowledge of cult psychology Acts is eerily familiar especially today

 The mother church did disappear at the time of the Roman attack James
the Just was judicially murdered a few years earlier but there is
evidence that the church survived him There is no evidence that it still
existed after the assault on the city The individuals historically
associated with that church disappear at that time 

 The followers of Jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknames
suggested connections with the Jewish terrorism of the time Zealotes
Iscariot Sons of Thunder

 For cult psychology there's an extensive literature

 For an understanding of the motivation of the members of the Jerusalem
church there is a mixed collection of sources The Anchor Bible has some
interesting articles but one thing I've noticed about biblical
scholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach are
notably lacking You basically have to spread your net wide and then
winnow For example Allegro and Schoenfeld have some interesting ideas
but they were both over the top Many interesting ideas have not been
followed up mostly due to religious reasons What was the connection of
early Christian theology to Samaritan dualism and protognosticism See
Stephen's speech in Acts for a Samaritan interpretation of the
crucifixion Schweitzer's interpretation of Jesus's motivations could be
updated especially now that we have the Essene and Chenoboskian
materials And so it goes For instance the convincing statistical
evidence concerning the authorship of the Pauline materials has been
completely ignored by biblical scholars

I don't track this area much any more My coursework is  years old I
have a personal theory that the synoptics were written in Syria during the
course of the Jewish Revolt I suspect Mark was written before the fall of
Jerusalem as an apology to get the Romans and Romansympathizers off the
back of the local Greek Christians Matthew and Luke were written with
similar goals but incorporating additional materials Given the evidence
in the Gospel of Thomas Chenoboskien I suspect Q came from a Samaritan
protognostic milieu In any case they were written in an environment
cut off by time or circumstances from Jerusalem not expecting further
contact and not wanting to be connected by outsiders to the themes of the
doctrines held by the Jerusalem church

Sorry about the lack of documentation but the time is hard to find

                  THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS
 
 Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip 



 Five days ago girls at the AlKhansaa secondary said a group of naked



 The same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth



     The army said it was checking the reports

Barfling brings us some curious stories that haven't been reported
outside of fertile imaginations  This fits in well with a report in
the New York Times from April  



Scores of Girls in Egypt Faint in Classrooms
By Chris Hedges
Cairo April 

The khamseen the blustery sandstorms that arrive every spring have
brought with them not only the usual clouds of grit and dust but also
what the authorities describe as collective hysteria

Hundreds of teenage girls have been fainting en masse in classrooms
breaking out in sobs and complaining of unpleasant smells and nausea



There is no clinical reason for it said Dr Ahmed Rashed at Agouza
Hospital where dozens of girls have been tested  It's just
hysteria  We have carried out blood tests urine tests every kind of
test we can think of and nothing has shown up

More than a thosand young girls between  and  have suffered
attacks in some  schools across the country since the first cases
were reported over two weeks ago



Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everything
from food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptian
women infertile 

Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe
One was reported about a decade ago in the IsraeliOccupied Gaza
Strip 

Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret service
for the spells  This is all the work of the Mossad said a militant
cleric in Imbaba a Cairo slum  They are seeding capsules around the
country that release something into the air that can't be detected
It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls  It is part of
a plot to destroy Egypt

  Where have seen this argument before  Because there is no
  evidence for the conspiracy therefore it must be true



Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical or
environmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause was
psychological  If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faint
for some reason he said the others start believing that they are
suffering from the sypmtoms

But no one is taking the matter lightly  Prime Minister Atef Sedki
has held regular mettings with Mr Dewidar to discuss the attacks
Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenon
to an end

Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept the
results of our scientific analysis Education Minister Hussein Kamal
Bahadeen said



You can't make this stuff up  Unless you're Barfling perhaps

I'm putting together a list of the civil rights violations perpetrated against
the Davidians by the FBIBATF Here is what I've got so far Care to add
any or provide more backup info

First Amendment
Second Amendment

Fourth Amendment
Fifth Amendment
Sixth Amendment
Eighth Amendment

Anything I miss

PV

You might try the Ninth Amendment since Koresh and his people
won't be exercising any of their unenumerated rights from now on

You might also try the Tenth Amendment since the jurisdiction of
Texas law enforcement was clearly violated 

Finally check out the Fourteenth Amendment which merely underlines
all of the previous violations cubed and squared

	And therefore conclude that the argument that Well it would
be better that the baby NOT be brought up under poor conditions makes
no sense and is in fact a very egocentric point of view  

Scuse please are you under the impression that this argument is made in
a vacuum and that somehow only the fetus' potential life is being considered

I would guess from your 'very egocentric' comment that you do not in which
case I have to ask just what the hell is wrong with egocentrism when one is
making a fundamental choice about one's life  Don't you consult your
own wants when you make decisions about your life  I haven't noticed you
asking me about what I want from you

I've got some great ideas  If egocentrism is ruled out you can show up
tomorrow am and I'll put you to work

  For those who still doubt what is going on this is
  from the still uncensored AP wire
  
  Two journalists from Houston arrested at gunpoint and
  cuffed and jailed for taking pictures of the compound today
  Later released on bail but cameras and film were confiscated
  
  jh
 
 	You could work for CNN  Take a few lines from a story and
 imply something with it but don't say what you really mean  
 
 	The police always close off the area around a major crime
 scene to keep evidence from being disturbed
 
     By taking pictures

	They leave foot prints they may drop some trash on the
ground and they may pick up something that looks interesting

 
  and it is a misdemeanor
 to enter the closed off area  One of the photographers also quickly
 spun around with a long lens camera while the officer was approaching
 a good way to get shot  
 
     Well that hopefully depends on what country one is in

	It has nothing to do with the country  You are coming toward
someone in an area where there has been violent confrontations and
one guy spins around quickly with an object that looks like a gun
Police are not trained to stand there and let someone gun them down

 There was also no indication in that story
 that they wouldn't get their cameras and film back after getting out
 of jail
 
     Once goverment agents have had an opportunity to check 
     the film out

	You're making statements that are not supported by facts
Don't let paranoia get the best of you  Wait to see if the reporters
don't get their film back or they get it back developed before
screaming conspiracy

 
     I think it was Barry Goldwater who once said the goverment
     that is big enough to give you everything is big enough to
     take everything from you  You life andor freedom including
     Of course that could not happen to you could it

	Our government is not big enough to give you everything
despite the efforts of people like Bill Clinton  Taking a statement
like that and thinking everything done in the name of law enforcement
is wrong' is simple minded and ignorant of history  A government is a
necessary evil and we must decide what it should be allowed to do
based on facts history and not by baseless claims

In a previous article vqhegubvmsbccbuffaloedu PVASILION says

Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes Bullets go flying
every where IMHO these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the
magazines went up A Texas ranger does not a pathologist make so I'll wait
for an autopsy to determine if they were shot first

A more likely explanation is that they shot themselves  Of course some
people may think that it hurts more to be shot than to burn to death

Perhaps nobody was shot

Just about everything the ATFFBI has claimed has turned out to be a lie or
unsupported by evidencefact I wish the media would recognize this and
start asking some tough questions so we could get some real answers

The most recent example occurred Thursday afternoon when the Medical
Examiner reported that of the  bodies recovered so far none have bullet
wounds in them He also stated that many of the bodies were face down
This contradicts ATFFBI claims that some were shot in the head and were
found face up

When asked about the ATFFBI reports that some had been shot he replied
there is absolutely no evidence of that  It appears they died from
smoke inhalation

Your point is well taken  I heard him on TV last night  Sometimes I
forget to not believe ANYTHING the FBIBATF says  The problem is that I
generally expect better from the FBI than from the BATF  Unfortunately
the FBI seems so desparate to deflect ANY criticism of themselves that
they are grasping at ANY straw no matter how thin

I saw in the Cleveland Plain Dealer this morning a report that the CEV
crew threw CS CANNISTERS into the Davidian house  I KNOW from
personal experience that burning type devices start fires  I certainly
put out enough of them in the pine forests of Ft Benning in the summer
of '  I'd like to know if they really threw burning CS grenades
 

If you were smarter you'd have these opinions

Again they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them

So the government by sheer economic force has basically cleared the 
basiccare market for itself The only way to test this would be for 
some really daring person to start up from scratch in Alberta andor 
Quebec a health insurance company offering basic care

Crazy Yes but that's almost how MCI got started
 
However the concept of risks is well known by insurance actuaries
and no private firm can get the kind of amortization that the public
pools can get  And since health insurance gets spent that doesn't
sit well with the insurance CEO's  and you get a situation like
in the US where rates keep going up to catch up

See what I mean It's a government monopoly

Sure  because it's a nonmarket phenomenom and the free market
can't solve it  Even our private insurance says that 

And remember  last year Quebec proposed giving the least risky
parts of basic care to the private sector  and they balked

Like you saidwhy should they

 and wants no part of it

By your own arguments if you don't want the provincial plan
you're basically up a creek
 
Yes  but in our culture arguing against it is like arguing
for national defence by means of warlords

True According to polls I've read usually in the sort of simpleminded 
stuff you were initally responding to something like  of Americans 
would like Canadianstyle health care whereas only  of Canadians 
would like it our way I'd be interested to know why there are that 
many  of Canada's population is about a million or so people 

Canada is saturated by American media  While pundits come on cable
and talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be what
people experience up north ends up not differing from what they see
portrayed on American television in movies ie same infrastructure
different insurance makeup  Yet they know not of any insurance
problems and have no idea of what an HMO is  but having lots of
British TV as well they know that they don't like NHS

Someone must have a reason to argue against it valid or notwhat 
kind of people are they

The polls that you refer to for the Canadian data are from the
annual July st polls conducted for Macleans our major English
newsmagazine by Decima Research  Decima president Allen Gregg is
considered one of the world's top poll researchers and Mulroney's
Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of
impossible election situations  The American polls are Harris polls
and have been reposted on USENET a few times and probably will again
I'm sorta suspicious myself 'cos maybe Americans want universal
coverage like Canada  I honestly doubt that most Americans realize
that we have private doctors and public and private hospitals ie
similiar health care infrastructure and our system is basically
pure insurance without HMO's

Given recent turnarounds by the HIAA endorsing universal coverage
and hostility to corporatist HMO's within the AMA and the complete
silence vis a vis Canadabashing by the AMA I suspect that they're
keeping the secret about Canada up their sleeve

Exactly Wouldn't you

Until the idea of managed competition arose there was no direct
threat to standalone private practice  In the 's the AMA
fought HMO's as corporatized socialist medicine  part of the
reason why we have only insurance and no HMO's in Canada 'cos
that was part of the deal cut with the CMA

I've also read that the three biggest American HMOs can be compared
straight up against some of the smaller Canadian provinces in the
Maritimes and they spend something like  less per patient
Maybe it does help
 
The American HMO's can still cream and they probably cover a smaller

 Item number   in a previous posting you stated that you had found
 overwhelming support for child molestation in socmotss

 You have finally responded to this one  I have read your complete file
 of postings to socmotss and to put it bluntly it does not support your
 assertion  In short this claim is bogus  Thank you for confirming this

All those postings in defense of adults having sex with children and
you just choose to claim that they don't say anything of the sort
There's no point in discussing this any further then  You are clearly
a liar without morals of any sort prepared to justify child molestation

Clayton are you really an idiot or do you just play one on USENET

You claimed you had postings from a dozen ie  socmotss posters that
supported child molestation Point aside that they were really defending
abolishing or modifying the age of consent laws or the right to be ATTRACTED
but don't act upon desires for children

so  out of thousands is an overwhelming majority

You never cease to amaze me

And you still haven't told me why my relationship with my partner is immoral

  he only addresses homosexual men and never in any post I've read

 Because women very very seldom molest children

Unhunh  Yeah  Right  Sure

You know that list of things that are stereotypically American  Mom

a child molester because such stories would simply be unAmerican

 I really don't want to waste time in

Oh you foolish person  I do know what the fuck I'm talking about
and will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you

The legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits
so highly taunted by its proponents  safer cheaper drugs along
with revenues from taxes on those drugs reduced crime and reduced
organized crime specifically etc etc

If you would like to prove how clueless you are we can get into
why  again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group
was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little
research


  From a pragmatic standpoint there certainly is some justification
if it is a vice people will commit anyway Shall we criminalize
alcohol again If the relegalization for alcohol were done from



Making you look bad is too damn easy  The vast social and historical
differences between alcohol and other drugs make this comparison
worthless



Vice statutes serve
only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous
for the poor as Tim so eloquently put it People will however


And so it shall be if the government by the people decides that
these vices are detrimental to the society as a whole


  And why pray tell is AIDS victim in snear quotes Are you of
the revisionist sort that thinks there is no such thing as the AIDS
plauge Or do they just deserve it

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact not
from the fire

	Thoughts
 
 How can a witness tell that someone in a burning truck is dead rather than
 unconscious

	Their testimony would be a contradiction of the plaintiff's charge and
witness that the occupant moved after the impact indicating he was alive and
trying to get out and provoking all sorts of sympathetic 'gross burned alive'
reactions

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed 
Shouldn't that be up to a jury
 
 What kind of witnesses  If we are talking about witnesses who were at
 the accident or were otherwise directly involved eg paramedics
 emergency room doctors etc then they should have been used at the
 first trial  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and
 forgot to call all of your witnesses

	They are two witnesses who didn't come forth until after the first
trial  While it would be tough luck for GM if they new about these witnesses
beforehand IMO this constitutes new evidence

 If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new
 interpretations of the data note that the loser can ALWAYS find
 such witnesses  If this were grounds for a new trial then the loser
 could ALWAYS get a new trial and keep doing so until the loser
 becomes a winner and then the other side would come up with new
 expert witnesses

	No I support rulings that deny new trials on those grounds

The test isn't whether GM knewotherwise that would reward GM for its
stupidity  The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their
existence  It works both waysif GM had won the trial and the plaintiff
turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should
have been located beforehand too bad so sadno new trial

Like Tim said you don't get a new civil trial because you screwed up

 I'll answer you're sarcasm with more sarcasm

 drugs and who IS NOT screwed up have to PAY for this idiot's problems  He's
 not doing anybody any harm except himself  The WOD on the other hand is an
 immediate THREAT to MY life and livelyhood  Tell me why I should sacrafice
 THIS to THAT

And not only that but if the drugs were legal we could have pharmacists instead
of pushers selling them and the pharmacists could be obligated to not only
inform the purchasers of the dangers of drug use but also show them how to use
the drugs in relatively safe ways  And the dangers of impurities responsible
for much of the suffering that drugs cause would be all but eliminated

So you feel that the defendents should have been convicted regardless of the
evidence Now that would truely be a sad day for civil rights

I don't know about everybody else but to me they should have been
convicted BECAUSE of the evidence which in my mind was quite
sufficient

What evidence are you aware of What was reported in the media or all of
the evidence that was presented at the trial

This sounds to me a lot like the first Rodney King  trial A bunch of people
who saw  to  seconds out of a several minute long video decided that
they knew more than people who had sat through a two week trial

 Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues  As
 I've noted before I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of 
 eliminating anticompetitive legislation with regard to auto dealers
 barbers etc  One need not however swallow the entire libertarian
 agenda to accomplish this end  Just because one grants the benefits of
 allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell hisher services without
 regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be 
 free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention  
 As somemany libertarians would argue  
 
 On a case by case basis the costbenefit ratio of government regulation
 is obviously worthwhile  The libertarian agenda however does not call
 for this assessment  It assumes that the costs of regulation of any
 kind always outweigh its benefits  This approach avoids all sorts of 
 difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic 
 to say the least
 
 I have no objection to an analysis of medical care education 
 national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide
 a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives
 than is provided through statist approaches   With some notable
 exceptions however I do not see such nittygritty worthwhile 
 analysis being carried out by selfprofessed libertarians  

Excellently put

Even as a libertarian I have to admit government does do some things I
like  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft  Lauderdale
that was partially built with tax dollars I don't know how much was
private and how much was stolen I mean public but it is beautiful and
I enjoy it  Keep in mind though most of the people in the city will
never attend a single performance there so they might feel differently
about having to help pay for it

However I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to
give government interventionpower on a casebycase basis  In fact
we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely
because it is not decided on a casebycase basis as much as other
issues  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the
sidewalk in front of the post office  They do not try to decide just
whether pronazi prochoice prolife or protax political speech
should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office  You can
imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority
on a casebycase basis

Not so with economic issues  Government does tell taxidrivers exactly
what they can charge but not the bus lines or the lawyers

Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a
casebycase basis we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a
casebycase basis

There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with
free enterprise  But there is no hope in my opinion of having a
government that interferes with free enterprise in an efficient
manner I call it political market failure

Thus if you value freedom and the abundance it produces you have to
swallow the whole libertarian agenda

      One of the commentators on one of the Big Three news programs 
described the VAT which ain't a sales tax as a tax government's love
I was even surprised he got the reason right  it effectively hides the
majority of the tax the consumer has to pay from the consumer  It's
kind of like they do with cars  You pay far more for automobile taxes than
most people realize because it's contained in two dozen different taxes
everything from your license to your tires to your gasoline

 From the Santa Rosa Cal PressDemocrat April   p B
 
     Male sex survey Gay activity low
 
     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American men's sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
      percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

Actually what the study shows is that  percent of the men surveyed
said they engaged in homosexual sex and  percent said they 
considered themselves exclusively homosexual

The point being that what people say and what they acutally do
may be different

It is interesting that this clip from the newspaper did not
mention that difference  Maybe it is conservative media bias  

     The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
     the  percent figure that has been part of the conventional
     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report

 Well you know that you're getting somewhere when you start getting
 responses like this
 
 Kent let me explain it to you
 
 If you are paying for a phone and you don't want callwaiting YOU DON'T
 NEED TO PAY FOR CALlWAITING

	Or if the phone comany charges you as if you did you could always

	a start your own company
	b use a different phone company

	But we're talking about the government  Some want item  others item
 etc  There will always be something someone doesn't want to fund

	You don't like abortion  Work to recriminalize it  But as long as it
is legal you really don't have a chance in getting funding stopped
permanently

 This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
 nervous because it has exposed a real scam

	What scam  I'll never have a hysterctomy sp but it's a legal
procedure and my health insurance company will pay for it  Shall I now argue
that I should be exempt from those fees
	Great exept now I'll pay more since it's primarly men who have
prostate procedures  Not to mention the extra cost of keeping track of who
wants to pay for what

	If it bothers you that much start your own health insurance company
that doesn't pay for abortion

	This is a free country you know

 If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
 abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
 to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
 coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

	So don't get coverage through that company  Simple

 A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder
 for reasons of conscience  

	Sources

 If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all
 anymore then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for abortion
 coverage if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs  Or are we
 going to start forcing Jews to eat pork Quakers to fight in wars etc

	No but I imagine you'd have them pay to fight wars wouldn't you

 No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto loyalty oath in support of
 abortion in order to gain access to health care ESPECIALLY if one's
 conscience is so obviously against the practice of abortion

	So don't buy health insurance from that company  Simple

	No I'm saying any long term investor the ones likely to have large
capital gains would be foolish to sell in order to avoid a tax hike that a
might disappear in any given year and b be overcome in a year or two by
accumlated gains

To which my response isso what  Not all people who pay capital gains
taxes are long term investors  More than enough of them aren't for there
to be huge blip whenever capital gains taxes get raised
   I never said that everyone would find this advantageous  I said that
more than enough would for the result to be readily noticeable and distort
trends
 
 Even if Brett's eventualreturn figures were correct  and they
 clearly weren't  he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '
 blip because he fails to consider  basic factors

	You misunderstand  I'm not trying to prove a cause for anything 
Merely pointing out that Ted's assertion that the blip in revenues was
caused by selling to avoid the tax can't be proven

  As Ted notes not everyone is a longterm investor  One might find
 oneself as I did in late  anticipating expenses in the near term
 that require selling off holdings  Given the choice between waiting a
 few weeks and taking an extra tax hit or selling in December with
 preferential tax treatment only a fool would choose the former

	Not disputed

  The fact that Brett can now construct post hoc calculations of
 what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects
 beside the point  There was plenty of Moneystyle advice given to
 unsophisticated investors in late  to sell now and save on
 taxes  In case anyone missed it there was no shortage of similar
 advice late last year in the NYTimes eg even though that advice
 was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law as in 
 but merely on the assumption that Clinton would raise tax rates
 without capping CG taxes contrary to the current proposal

	It works for any situation  If you believe the market is going up
don't sell

	If believe it's not sell  But then you'd be selling anyways wouldn't
you

	So where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided
that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out

	There isn't any

	Ted's saying that the increase over the previous year is proof of
that proposition but I'm saying you can't know that the trend of increasing
capital gains revenues wouldn't account for a lot of that increase
	 was the height of the housing boom remember  People were
trading up like mad

 It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal
 economic interest  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless
 pulleys though this sort of thinking often fails to describe
 accurately what happens in the real world

	Indeed

  A Alan Brock  Orange County Register Editorial titled A case for
  repealing the income tax got my attention

  Some quotes

    a tax on income because of the flexible definition of that
   concept invites the government to snoop into every nook and
   cranny of our lives Encouraging people to snoop on one another
   and report transgressions against the almighty state which most
   Americans deplored in Nazi or communist regimes 

    Although most Americans paid no income tax at all  years ago
    withholding began only during World War II as a temporary
   exigency and in  the median family federal income tax was 

   Last year the federal government got only  percent of its income
    from income taxes How long ago was it that the federal government
    somehow managed to stagger along on  percent of its  revenue
     Would you believe five

    The income tax has converted a free people into a society of
    the fearful and the snitches

      I just wish I had the email address of total gumby who
      was saying that  Clinton didn't propose a NST 


Actually Jerry Brown essentially didand Clinton in his demagogue
persona condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year

However

Why don't the Republicans get their act together and say they
will support a broadbased VAT that would have to be visible
the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform 

       The Republicans are in general fighting any tax increase
There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase
incrementally

       BTW what is different between Canada's tax and most of
Europe's that makes it visible

and
force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax
rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
be increased only via a national referendum

       This would require a constitutional amendment and Congress
enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that
Besides with the  majority necessary to pull that off you'd 
have a difficult time forcing anything like that

Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile
shift the tax burden from investment to consumption and get
health care reform and a frozen low top marginal tax rate
all in one fell swoop

       Primarily because it's a practical impossibility to freeze
tax rates

       However this is something that bothers me  We're always talking
about consumer confidence and consumer spending as gauges for the
economy  If they really are important wouldn't shifting taxes to
consumption provide a disincentive to spend money

This was in Wed WSJ

start
The white house seeking to mount public pressure on GOP senators bombarded
news outlets in some senator's home states with news releases warning that
certain projects may not be funded if the billion stimulus bill isn't
passed

None of the projects mentioned are actually in the bill rather they are
part of a wish list that may be funded from the  billion in
Community Development Block Grants



end

I could have sworn I heard a bunch of Clintonites going on and on raving
about how dishonest it was that the Rebublicans were taking items from this
wish list in order to ridicule this bill Now that Clinton is using that
same list in order to garner support for the bill are you guys going to
do the honarable thing and say that Clinton is being dishonest

Considering that Clinton received a draft notice and got out of it he admits it the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would
be inclined to risk any extra exposure on

As a libertarian with a small l who voted for Clinton I think that he
should abolish the Selective Service and the draft  If his conscience
forbade him to go to war in Vietnam it should forbid him to perpetuate
this system of governmentsanctioned slavery

Agreed Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf
The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there
is a lack of ASW foes to contend with The Navy is considering reducing
the number of attack subs to  Navy Times and that would entail
getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class
Politically General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get
Seawolf subs whether we need them or not

If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues the ECONOMY
and choose to stay out of other people's wars Iraq Bosnia Somalia
we would not be in this fix  An anyway couldn't the jobs be replaced by
improving our domestic situation  I'm not for continued deficit spending
but if Clinton and Congress want to spend I'd rather they improve the 
infrastructure than fight other people's wars

In addition more bases need to be closed Probably Long Beach Naval Station
and others The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being 
required to home port a total fleet of  ships
The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down
a pork happy Congress

A novel idea  Getting away from naval bases what about refurbishing
decommissioned Air Force bases as airports  This would be SO much cheaper
than building them from the ground up Denver's new airport is one of the 
most appalling examples of porkbarreling and cronyism I have seen in
my lifetime  Even if no more airports are needed I'm sure Bill Gates
or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields and the
money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt

Wrong  We need its capability  Sure it has its problems

I do read Av Week and don't remember this  Could you supply the date

Aviation Week March   p

the CBO estimates that matching the capability of  Cs would
require  Cs at a total cost of  billion This option is still
more than  billion cheaper than completing the C program which
the CBO estimates will cost  billion

Sorry I was nine billion off The Cs would be ten billion cheaper
  As for C vs C  the C can't carry as much
but has more capability  read  can land at smaller airfields of which
there are more of  than the C  Now is the C pork  It depends
on whether your job relies on it or not    In California right now
I would say that it is not pork since due to peace dividend so many 
people are out of work 

Well California voted overwhelmingly for change right
The argument to continue military programs just to support jobs is
a poor one It's kept quite a few bases open that should have been closed
years ago wasting billions of taxes

   You mean since your philosophy took over the economy has almost
   collapsed
  
  Excuse me my philosophy  You don't have any idea what my philosophy
  is  The American economy has had its ups and downs through a number of
  prevailing economic philosophies  But then economics is hardly a science

 In my lifetime your philosophy  socialism masquerading as a liberal
 welfare state  has been in ascendancy

Yoearth to Claytonmy philosophy  I have never discussed this with you
I know it's a minor point but gee dude you have no idea what economic
and political principles I adhere to  But don't let that stop youyou're on a
roll  Just ascribe to me whatever you wantI know you'll choose wisely
After all I do believe in personal responsibility

  No I mean exactly what I wrotethe welfare system of the New Deal is
  wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs

 Absolutely  So the response of socialists is take us even further
 into socialism

Duh  What else would you expect a socialist to do

   Flashinthepan  No your subculture has utterly dominated the
   TV and movie industries for two decades now

  My subculture  My we're getting personal  The only subculture I see
  dominating the TV and movie industries is money  If you'll buy it
  they'll sell it  And as recent movements to boycott TV advertisers have
  shown they're very sensitive about what sells  Whatever happened to
  personal responsibility anyway  Or am I personally responsible for
  the decline in that too

 To the extent that people have been encouraged to NOT be responsible
 for themselves yes

a Just when and where have I encouraged people not to be responsible
for themselves  Be specificbut do make up random dates and heinous
acts as you see fit

b You and I have encouraged many people to do many things  How does that
in any way make our audiences less responsible for their actions  Is there
a finite amount of responsibility so cf conservation of energy as
I become more responsible for an occurrence by encouraging it the actual
perpetrator becomes correspondingly less so  At what point does the
perpetrator become completely innocent altogether  You know this lends
a whole new meaning to the term the moral high ground

   Oddly enough all the unskilled or semiskilled people I know manage
   to find employment almost immediately  Maybe she needs to move to a
   cheaper part of the country where jobs are plentiful and the cost
   of living is lower

  The west side of Chicago is about as cheap as it getssqualor city
  Tell me about all these places where it's cheap to live and jobs are
  abundantI'll pass them on

 Sonoma County

I will pass the info on  Out of curiosity what kind of jobs would these
be  What's the demographic mix wrt race age culture

  lots of employment and utterly surrounded by socialists  Well I suppose
  that's the sort of environment that would attract socialists or at least
  not dissuade them

 No it's that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists  all the
 spoiled rich kids feeling guilty about their wealth  But not guilty
 enough to give it away  they just look for politicians to take MY
 more limited wealth away

Life's a bitch ain't it  Man you've got to get out of Fornicaliahave
you considered someplace perhaps geographically distant but politically
more friendly to you like say Indiana  Or maybe Utah

  Well I doubt that much of this goes to drugsthere isn't much left after
  buying food and there is very little in the first place  Sure you read
  about such cases now and then but that's what makes them news  Show me
  your statistics about AFDC abuse

 I can tell you that relatives I have known the drugs came first the
 food was secondary

I don't doubt it but unless you can show me statistics to the contrary
I will persist in my apparently dogmatic socialist belief hey if you say
so that most AFDC money really doesfor better or worse in the long
termfeed FDCs

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money

It is always cheaper to kill children than to take responsibility for
them  Why stop at birth why not fund infanticide up to age 

One can't help wondering just how many children YOU have taken
responsibility for

Hmmm

We are not winning the war on drugs  I think you can see that one
of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that
the war on drugs is being won is to selectively quote statistics
only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone
down  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is
an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to
deceive the public

Unfortunately there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented
here either  Due to rounding the  est for LSD could be anywhere
from  to  and the  est could be anywhere from  to 
This means that the actual change if you believe these statistics in the
first place was anywhere from  to   Similarly the increase in
cocaine use could be anywhere from  to  and the increase of
crack use could be anywhere from  to   This doesn't even
take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here

This does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded
but it does mean that USA Today has not surprisingly provided us
with virtually no information

From the Santa Rosa Cal PressDemocrat April   p B

    Male sex survey Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
    the  percent figure that has been part of the conventional
    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report

 So what

So there are less gays then the gays claim

 It will be interesting to see the reaction when million queers
   gather in Washington DC After all if there are only million of
   us then this is an event unprecidented in history


Dream on  Abortion and AfricanAmerican Civil rights rallies don't even bring
in half of that

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 

Don't forget that  had  or more partners


I was wondering why I wasn't getting laid

Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population

And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
who said they where homosexual Or is that number to inconvient for
you


If it's more then who cares

It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are

Fuck off


Actually I bet you more gaybi men are as not as promiscuous as gay men 
because more of them could have the option of living a straight life and 
with social pressures probably would at least try

      and bean eating ways Accept  into your heart

Did you know that is is a fact that homosexuality was comparatively high in 
Hitler's storm troopers SA before he came to power  I wonder if they got to 
put the triangles on themselves

Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality
uses a very flawed IMHO source of information to pass jusgement on all
homosexual and bisexual men

Only the most comprehensive survey on sexuality in  years

  It would seem more logical to say that since
the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity
larger as well  In my opinion orientation has nothing to do with it


Chance and size have nothing in common on the multimillion number scale we are 
talking about


Men are men and they all like sex  I am a gay male  I have had sex three
times in my life all with the same man  Before that I was a virgin

So whose promiscuous


Nobody said that you were  Chill

Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals  Just because
someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do  Look at the world

Well said

Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero


Actually the Kinsley Report in or  used a high percentage of 
prisoners so

This was in Wed WSJ

start
The white house seeking to mount public pressure on GOP senators bombarded
news outlets in some senator's home states with news releases warning that
certain projects may not be funded if the billion stimulus bill isn't
passed

None of the projects mentioned are actually in the bill rather they are
part of a wish list that may be funded from the  billion in
Community Development Block Grants



end

I could have sworn I heard a bunch of Clintonites going on and on raving
about how dishonest it was that the Rebublicans were taking items from this
wish list in order to ridicule this bill Now that Clinton is using that
same list in order to garner support for the bill are you guys going to
do the honorable thing and say that Clinton is being dishonest

As one of the Clintonites cited above I'll try to clarify since this
is not a case of Clinton's dishonesty I won't necessarily defend him
on other issues  

There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community
Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal  Congressional
Republicans in an effort to discredit the stimulus package selected what
they felt were silly sounding projects from a wishlist of POTENTIAL 
projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package
was ever proposed  The document in question was designed to pressure the
White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted
to Congress  It didn't work

The  billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close
to covering the total estimated cost of the original wishlist  If it
were passed communities would have to select which projects to fund and
at what level

In the case of Spokane Wa Tom Foley's home district no one ever
expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool one of the 
Republicans' examples FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS
PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total 
amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus 
package for ALL projects  

The plan instead was to use the money on public housing construction
and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage  Yup there are
places where that is true  The swimming pool improvements were near the
bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city  The  million
or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing
priorities

If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package it is these projects
that will be affected by the lack of funds  And that is why the Clinton
administration has been publicizing the issue

A final point  One may or may not like community block grants  It is
worth noting however that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them
is new  Since the Nixon administration Republicans have generally 
supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending
arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending
priorities than Washington bureaucrats  

Is it clear now  Or is this all too complicated to understand

I believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy and 
basing their count on those  I see two problems with this  One can they 
get everybody to take one and only one  Two they couldn't possibly have
been able to choose a colordesign that won't clash with somebody's outfit

and Three  The ads I've seen for the wristbands indicate they're
charging  a wristband  As I've seen them the wristbands look like
clear plastic with multicoloured rainbow threads in them labeled
 March on Washington     the  being your particular
wristband number
 
Certainly not everyone at the March on Washington will be willing to
shell out five bucks for a piece of plastic


I bought mine at the MOW storefront
Its not plastic its woven material

but I think you miss the point
its not about the five bucks in your pocket its about supporting the
march and helping to pay for all the printed materail and scehdulkes and
organisation and

all leading up to the literal birth of Queer visibility in this country

up to this point all our news coverage has been driven by events thatb
happen to us 
this event is happening by our direct action
of course the last MOW was the same thing but they ignored us
I guess that was just labor pains
perhaps they will ignore us again in which case we will come in
even largeer numbers next time

Lst night in DC there were so many queers out and about you could hardly get
in any place
I suspect thatb over the next two days that will become exponentially
larger

To my mind this is a physical bsuting down of the collective closet of
queer invisibility

the five bucks is insignificant

 Above quote from Rush's radio show yesterday when he referred to recent events
 near Waco Texas
 

Me either Yes it's regrettable that eightysomeodd people died but
they could have walked out the door with the simple turn of a knob It's
just plain stupid to lay the blame for this at anyones feet but ol' Vernon's
If the FBIBATF started the fire why did it take six or so hours to catch
Timed incendiary devices you say Could those idiots not have picked them 
up and tossed them out the window And what of this argument about whether
a wood burning stove was being used It's a known fact that when a city is
under seige the citzens thereof eat what they can how they can Hell
the BD's could've had MRE type grub for all any of us know
My conscience is clear
 
 Does the word smolder mean anything to you  Several minutes can go by
 before a smoldering cigarette butt in a couch sets the couch on fire
 Here's a possible maybe very possible scenario  one of the CS gas
 grenades that the FBI threw in earlier caused some material like the
 drapes or carpet to smolder for an extended period of time  Later
 on when a tank punched a hole in the wall knocking over one of the
 BDs kerosene lanterns kerosene spilled onto this smoldering material
 resulting in a fire that killed  people inside  Another possibility

And this results in a fire that starts in one room and torches the entire place
before anyone in the adjacent rooms can escape  I don't think so  So much for
the smolder theory

Yes we've heard that the survivors are now saying that We've also
seen the videotape which shows that the fire started in two or
three different places which weren't near the tank

    I have not seen the tape on CNN  Which network did you see it on

Tim I saw the film on CNN as it happend It was clear from that
Tim tape that the fire started in ONE location Right where the
Tim tank was attacking and then had pulled back There were not
Tim several spots where the fire started it started in one
Tim location and was spread in the direction of the heavy wind
Tim The FBI claims to have seen or filmed several starting
Tim points Yet they keep this hidden They have spread so much
Tim lies Well I guess if I was responsible for the mass murder
Tim of  people who were exercising constitutional rights I
Tim would lie about it too

Gosh Tim you must have seen a different live broadcast than I did While
the smoke did emerge from one place initially it was a considerable
distance from the tank and in a very short time fire appeared at several
places a good distance apart from there

Then there's that nagging question about why out of all those people
only a few made any attempts to escape or save the children If it were
me with my child and I wasn't committing suicide I believe I would have
made SOME attempt to at least save the child As it was at least one of
the survivors was attempting to GO BACK INTO THE FIRE when they were
physically removed No one lifted a finger to bring out a child apparently

How do you explain that And the two survivors who claimed to have doused
the place with lantern oil and SET the fire no doubt on David's orders 
At least until the lawyers talked to them 

Tim And also why have they not yet released the search warrant  

That is a good question Maybe because it would be a further
embarrassment seeing as how the ATF went in there in Dirty Harry mode
initially 

As stupidly as it all was handled I find it difficult to believe that the
entire FBI has completely gone corrupt under a new administration less
than  days old Stupidity and bad decisions and plans have always been
with us They just had an alignment at Waco

	And while courts have found it ok to charge women less for auto
insurance it's illegal to charge them more for health insurance because they
live longer or make them pay more into retirement funds so the legal arena 
isn't being  consistent on the gender issue
 Not so in PA  Recently the gender inequity in auto insurance was
 removed  Just a point

MotorVoter stuff

	My friend after the election brought up the point that it
would enable more people to vote however since it makes it easier to
get to the place of registration  He brought up the analogy that if
there were only ONE place to vote say in Alaska would it be
excessive and wasteful to petition to have more places to vote  This
is a similar idea a way to encourage more people to vote by making it
more easily accessible  I not knowing where I stood played devil's
advocate and said  well would you have the taxpayer's money go to
busing for those people that have trouble making it to DMV then
Where does the right to vote merge with the right to vote easily
Where should we draw the lines  

       Well there does have to be a line  And to be honest extending
voter registration to DMVs is hardly analogous to having only one
place for registration in Alaska and opening a new one in Atlanta  More is 
not always better once you've passed a certain point

	My friend said that that is obviously an extreme and that
actually the motorvoter bill would SAVE money because no longer would
the city have to pay someone to sit in the town hall and spend all
hisher time filing those things they'd just be at the push of a
button or the filling out of an X at DMV  So I actually someone
else but there's no need to confuse this anymore countered again
saying that wouldn't congress as always get exorbitent budgets and
fund committees to orchestrate and oversee the implementation the
argument went back and forth forever ranging from whether or not it's
BETTER to have more people voting whether that is even relevant
etc

	just looking for some more opinions  Anybody got 'em

       I thought the Motor Voter bill passed

       In any case my experiance with Tennessee's voter registration
system which you can register with by mail by the way is that nobody
who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration
All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's
part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to
it  Once you register it's good unless you miss for years worth of
elections of move

       It's easy to register now  I simply don't see the value in going
out and trying to get people registered who don't have enough gumption to
even write and have the proper forms sent to them   How can we expect
responsible decisions out of these people

Since  the members of the European Parliament the parliamentary assemby
of the European Community have been elected directly by the citizens of the
Member States Before the Members of the European Parliament MEPs were just
Members of National Parliaments MNPs elected by and from among their peers

In the European Parliament every Member State has a fixed number of seats
which increases less than proportionally with the population Once in five
years a general European election is being held in which the citizens of all
Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament Next
elections are due in 

Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one
country to another Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election
of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system up to now every country has just
used its own system more or less the same one used for national elections
British MEPs are elected in a firstpastthepost system with one MEP per
district nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional
representation But then in some countries France Italy MEPs are allowed to
be a MNP as well whilst in others they are not Belgium Netherlands

The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its
own members so that every candidate should have the same regulations to
comply with regardless of the Member State she wants to be elected for I
would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions

 Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every
Member State continue to use its own regulations for European elections that
is

 Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented with one or
more MEPs per district or would you prefer a system with proportional
representation for the whole of the Community or per state per region per
district

 Do you think the European Commission or just its president should be
directly elected too or should it be appointed by the European Parliament or
by the joint Member State governments as it is now

 The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for
election in another Member State they are residing in Do you think you would
or could vote for a foreigner if hisher ideas appeal to you

 Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament
or a regional parliament too Or a member of a national or regional government
body

 The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels
MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority but
political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to
the status quo Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament
should meet in one city only and if yes which

 I ask this question because there is a tradition and one that
 is highly regarded by many people that several hundred Jews
 elected to throw themselves off a cliff at Masada rather than
 submit to Roman rule The circumstances at Masada and those at
 Waco would seem in general terms quite similar and yet so far
 as I'm aware nobody has seriously suggested that the Jews were
 insane
 
   As has already been pointed out the Jews faced a totally
   different fate at the hand of the Romans than did Koresh 
   at the hand of the feds  The Jewish men would most likely
   have been crucified the the women and children sold into
   slavery   One can well argue that Koresh may have thought
   that a similar fate awaited him but there was scant rational 
   basis for that fear so insane seems to describe any such
   belief

What is the penalty if convicted of murdering  Federal agents
in Texas  The death penalty

   None of which excuses the reckless action of the feds who
   allegedly believing they were dealing with a nut should 
   have exercise much more restraint  Indeed given their 
   stated goals of saving the children one might also apply
   the moniker insane to the feds' actions

Yup

 BBC world news service on shortwave originating out of London
 reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank when
 making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
 lamp and that is how the fire started  Attempts were made by the
 people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly
 
 We're hearing it  It sure rings true it's consistent in a way that
 mass suicide by fire is not  This survivor is also saying that they
  
 It rings true
 
 There was a separate report that an overhead helicopter which was recording
 the entire incident on video tape has a visual record of SEVERAL files
 I think the number  was mentioned starting at different parts of the
 compound

Has this video been made public  The FBI spokesman also said they 
first knew of the fire when black smoke started pouring out but
later said that three different FBI agents saw BD members starting
the fires

Also the FBI claims to have listening devices bugs in the compound  
Will they make public the tapes of what the BD said

 To me this attempt to blame the FBI for starting the fire simply looks
 like an attempt by a survivor to shift blame away from the BD's
 
 I think it is a crock

Well sealing the initial search warrent keeping the media miles away
not letting the BD talk to the public making contradictory statements
not releasing the vidio  tapes are not steps to ensure public confidence 
in their actions

        Here's a question for those of you far more informed about
 health care than I am  My Almanac quoting OECD Health Data
 lists US Public Health Expenditures for  as being  of
 GDP or  of total health expenditures

        Are we really paying  of our expenditures to insure
  of our population

        Heh no doubt more evidence that the government is more efficient
than 'evil' for profit health care

Proving once again that Brett has a major thinking problem

Two groups that the government insure are the elderly and the medically an
needy those who have impoverished themselves through spending for medical
care  The typical elderly person spends  times what a person under age
  The typical medically needy person spends about  times what the
average person does

You've got to adjust those data Brett

Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes Bullets go flying every
where IMHO these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines 
went up A Texas ranger does not a pathologist make so I'll wait for an
autopsy to determine if they were shot first 

Either way they're all dead and the FBI  Atty Gen Vampria are still
responable

Last time I checked the bullet weighs quite a bit more than the case and said
case is a hell of a lot weaker than the chamber of a gun and the burning rate
of gunpowder is propotional to the pressure

Translation  Not bloody likely

Ammunition exploding would either explode in bulk removing large hunks of the
surrounding landscape or it would go off singly and spray the area with low
velocity lightwieght shrapnel  If a cop can't tell the difference between
a wound inflicted by such shrapnel and a wound inflicted by a  grain bullet
doing better than Mach  he's in the wrong line of business

I wonder if the seven Islamic fundamentalist who have just been sentenced

don't feel like Jews have the right to practice Judaism in Israel  Let's not
forget that during the Jordanian occupation  of the West Bank and Jerusalem
Jews were not allowed into Jerusalem even to pray at the Western Wall the most

Does Judaism permit freedom of religion

In a debate about the student government here at our university a
question was raised by one student senator  

Why should I represent people who didn't vote

and by implication this raises a different question

Why should I represent people who didn't vote for me

I feel that there are many good reasons that anyone elected to public
office in student government or any other government should strive
to represent ALL the people in their constituency class of ' or a
geographical area or whatever  

I would like some help from others in phrasing a reasonable argument
on this topic  Thanks

  Homosexuals are vicious screwedup often
  really evil people
  I've learned quite a bit in the last two years  Evil vicious
  dishonest lying scum is the only way to describe homosexuals
  Clayton E Cramer uunetpyramidoptilinkcramer  My opinions all mine
       I believe that Clayton is full of shit  Who could believe anyone so biased
 and so obviously misaligned  If he were the slightest bit openminded he wouldn't
 write such slanted smears  Especially to generalize an entire group of people 

I would say this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black


     Really now  Why is this the pot calling the kettle black  I am stating
that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is closeminded and that
his opinion should be ignored  Clayton is stating that a group of at least
two million  American citizens are evil vicious malicious childmolesters

     Here's a hypothetical question  If Clayton said something like all
those niggers are really stupid  Please don't be offended I'm not racist
but merely using an example of Clayton's malign logic  And then said he
read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school I
bet he wouldn't have your support  Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are
dishonest evil lying child molesters without PERSONALLY having a single
homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him

     God created a place for bigots  It's called Hell and Clayton is going
to burn there for a long time  I pray for him to find in his heart the
Christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers
and sisters because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never
be righteous

inside the compound and quit makeing contradictory statements

Do you believe their statement that the children were killed by
lethal injection  They later stated that the childrens bodies

how did they come up with the lethal injection theory

We're hearing it  It sure rings true it's consistent in a way that
mass suicide by fire is not  This survivor is also saying that they
were trapped inside by the damage done by the tanks

	Why is an accidental fire more plausible than a mass suicide 
	considering that the Davidians were an apocalyptic cult with
	a history of armed violence If the FBI has reason to lie 
	about the cause of the fire if it resulted from their own
	negligence then the BD survivors also have reason to lie if
	they started the blaze 

The FBI claims the fire was set simultaneously in three places  They
claim the building was filled with tear gas  Electricity was cut off
tanks were rolling all around  How did the BDs coordinate the
setting of the fire 

	It's fairly simple It was decided to burn the place down
	and more than one agent was dispatched to set the fires in
	separate parts of the compound I doubt that simultaneously
	means at the exact same time in this case It likely means
	close enough together to preclude them from being part of
	the same fire


The FBI claims that men with torches set the fires but haven't released
any evidence of this though it seems inconcievable that they don't have
any if it was true

	They might be waiting until the evidence comes in from the
	site and the investigation is at least well underway 


All of the BDs
previous actions were aimed towards their survival not their death

	The same could be said of Jonestown

The idea that kerosene lamps would be all over the place with
electricity cut off makes sense  The idea that ramming tanks into
the building would spill them and cause a fire makes sense    The
possibility that the FBI wouldn't know this is nil  It wasn't simple
negligence

	Maybe Then again I've been suprised at what folks have missed
	in the past in similar situations Don't jump t oconclusions

Because the place was a tinder box with straw bales for insulation and they
wouldn't have time to die from smoke inhalation before the fire reached them
Those people burned to death a truly horrible and agonizingly painful way to
die which I don't think even a fanatic would willingly inflict on himself let
alone his family 

	You don't know much about the fall of Diem's government in Vietnam
	Or the traditional Indian practice of Suttee People have been
	burning themselves to death or willing to go through such and end
	for political and religious reasons since the beginning of time
	Also death from smoke inhalation is little better than dying from
	the flames themselves Think about breatning in searing toxic
	gasses It's not pleasant
	

To anyone who remembered Jim Jones and who thought that mass
suicide was a real possibility selfimmolation would simply not be the method
of choice

	Then again to a Buddhist monk it might be To each his own

Far more likely to be bombs bullets or poisoned koolaid  That's
not to say they definitely didn't do it  I don't make claims either way  but
I find the idea implausible enough to want to see the gov't thoroughly inves
tigated to determine if they started the fire by accident 

	I'm waiting to see what the government has too

	Blue Cross is the government health insurance provider

	Oops
 
 Oops  Blue Cross may well be the insurer for government workers in
 Massachusetts as it is for a number of state and local governments I
 don't know  But Blue Cross is certainly NOT a government agency  
 It is a private insurer

	Yes it is a private insurer that has to deal with government
regulations concerning how it's employees are to be covered processed etc 
There are a mountain of forms that gov employees have to go through

Sorry but this is a red herring

Are you contending that the mountain of forms are processed by Blue
Cross  Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee
and as an employee of a private corporation I saw no difference between
the two sets of forms  

Moreover the administrative costs associated with MedicareMedicaid
the two primary forms of government insurance are considerably lower than
the average for private insurance companies    versus 

If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring
government employees than private employees post it  Otherwise try
to stick to factual assertions


 And as the original post implied it is private insurers in the US 
 whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative
 costs of taxsupported health care systems in Canada and elsewhere

	Only those that remain paperbound and refuse to standardize

Well now that's an interesting defense of the free enterprise system
Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents 
private insurance companies from standardizing

In fact it is true that some of the redtape burden stems from the 
lack of standardization among the  or so private insurers in the US
but it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than
free enterprise at work  

By the way Barron's the bible of Wall Street this week admitted that
administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because a
singlepayer system is always cheaper  Guess even the free enterprise
advocates are beginning to see the light

 Try again

	Why  My HMO provides good service at a low cost  And I don't have the
government telling my doctors what they can and can not say about medical
procedures

Sorry but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care
reform with the Bush administration's gag order on federally funded family
planning clinics  There are no proposals that would control what your
doctorcan and cannot say about medical procedures

Try again

have to take someone's word

But it seems to me that no one knows for sure what was pumped in yet
Or what some folks on scene might stoop to or what bureaucratic or
tactical mistakes might have been made All being washed away

One way or another  so much for patience Too bad you couldn't just 
wait Was the prospect of God's Message just too much to take

previous attempts through negotiation had fallen through and the FBI had 
said that this was to end asap

One person and one person ONLY is to blame for this Vernon Howell aka David

who KILLED four law enforcement agents and injured several others It was 
Koresh who refused to peacefully walk out of the compound and fight out the 
legalities in a court of law with a jury of  citizens note I can't say
a jury of his peers as his writings indicate that he thought that he was

As for who started the fires in the building there have been numerous local
news reports with interviews with some of the rescued people stating in fact
their own people were starting the fires  Once again it wasn't Reno 
or Clinton who lit the matches in this It was Vernon Howell The only people 
in the building I feel sorry for are the children who perished in the blaze
as they had no choice in the matter The rest of them had every chance

 This is called NotQuotingTheEntireArticle tm  Try it

which you refer please note that many religious beliefs evolved from
basic pragmatic principles of daytoday living If we had lived

Certainly many religious beliefs seem to be positive principles for
everyday living  Indeed I believe it is the Islamic religion which
avoids alcohol I apologize if I name the wrong religion and that
is certainly a physical positive in many respects  However this
proves nothing  Just because something is a basic pragmatic
principle of daytoday living TODAY doesn't mean it evolved from
the same  Especially those beliefs and mostly positions held based
on interpretations of the religion

Religious beliefs come from many places but most will be backed up
after many levels of arguments to Because that's how it is written
or God says  Now I'm not faulting that but that is not a basic
pragmatic principle as you mean it in this context  It is a belief
based on faith which by definition is not necessarily backed up by
logic  Faith is a given  God is a absolute truth when arguing from
religion  Also many religions would reject your thesis that their
beliefs simply come from these daytoday principles

In summation if you wish to use religious arguments be prepared to
back them up with It says in the fill in religious document here
because most religions things which at least I denote as religions
are based on the writings of or teachings of fill in religious
figure here

NOTE Religion is a charged topic and if I offended anyone regarding
	  my references to God I apologize  Please insert your own
	  sensible references the argument should apply to nearly all
	  religions

Funny  The only two antisemitic slurs I've ever seen on this newsgroup

This is neither wit or satire  The point it succeeds in making is not one 
I suspect that the poster intended to make

Sigh

The use of the term ZOG which I understand stands for Zionist
Occupation Government or some such bullshit was used for satiric
purpose  Since the posting I was responding to was on altconspiracy
among other crossposted groups I composed a satiric message
using jargon sometimes found on that group  I figured that the
content and context of the message was so absurd that no one would
take any part of it completely seriously

If anyone believes that I am an antisemite it will be news to my
Jewish boss and his Israeli wife both of whom I am on cordial terms
with as well as as the many Jews that I have been friends companions
and coworkers with over the years  Not to mention news to me

As far as guns go I support the Bill of Rights  all of it  and
if you wish to arm yourself to the teeth by all means do so
However the concept of a  calibre machine gun as a sporting weapon
for target practice or otherwise struck and continues to strike me
as moderately absurd even if constitutionally protected

     Male sex survey Gay activity low

     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American men's sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
      percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

Actually what the study shows is that  percent of the men surveyed
said they engaged in homosexual sex and  percent said they
considered themselves exclusively homosexual


Yes and of course the Kinsey Report taken  years ago in much more liberal 
times regarding homosexuality

The point being that what people say and what they acutally do
may be different

It is interesting that this clip from the newspaper did not
mention that difference  Maybe it is conservative media bias  


Or smart enough to realize that that argument would have to apply to every 
survey regarding homosexuality  Therefore they would look stupid Actually 
Idid see Bryant Gumble bring that point up  Hee hee



     The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
     the  percent figure that has been part of the conventional
     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report

 If you are paying for a phone and you don't want callwaiting YOU DON'T
 NEED TO PAY FOR CALlWAITING

 If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
 abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
 to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
 coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage

Why the hell would somebody named Dennis be paying for
abortion coverage at all  Why aren't you also complaining that
you want your insurance premiums reduced because you won't be
needing that pap smear coverage

C J Silverio	cjsgicom	ceejwellsfcaus

How would someone named Dennis be stuck paying for abortion
coverage  if abortion is put under a catagory of a general
medical procedure  You have to ask the insurer Would my policy
cover an abortion to find out  If it does you should have a
right to decline that coverage if YOU DON'T WANT IT

The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for the
coverage YOU WANT  If basically you want catastrophic coverage
you get a policy with a high deductible with a correspondingly
LOWER premium  Similarly you don't have to be COMPELLED to
take on a policy covering things like liposuction or hair
transplantation if you DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE again
at a corresponding savings to you

If you don't want to be covered for abortion you should not be
COMPELLED to  To millions of Christians abortion is not a
gynocological examination or a pap smear  To them abortion
is murder  To them being covered for abortion means that they
are paying for a service which THEY THINK IS EVIL CLEARLY
DON'T WANT and will NEVER USE  In such a case all that is
happening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHER
PEOPLE'S abortions

When you are being forced to BUY something you DON'T WANT and
will NEVER USE this is called extortion

When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to buy a jukebox for
the owner's protection this is called racketeering 

And if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing a
defacto loyalty oath in support of abortion by promising to
help pay for other people's abortions when one is clearly
opposed to this procedure this is tantamount to the same thing

Don't forget about the culture  Sadly we don't as a society look upon
homosexuality as normal and as we are all too well aware there are alot
of people who condemn it  As a result the gay population is not encouraged
to develop nonpromiscuous relationships  In fact there are many roadblocks
put in the way of such committed relationships  It is as if the heterosexual
community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays 
are immoral  My if we allowed gays to marry raise children  we might
just find out they're as moral as we are can't have that can we 

Just some thoughts  Flame away 

Dan

This is a very good point  One that I have held for sometime  We do not
allow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire  Even with
heterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge and
information about sexuality and relationships

It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positive
view of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitly
that they are wrong and immoral 

The concepts about personal relationships are deeply embedded in emotionalism
and fear these fears cover a wide range but mostly jealousy and lack of trust
seem to be cornerstones of modern day American relationships  We also set on
top of this the concepts of Madison Avenue attractiveness and standards and put
the pressure on to measure up

Greg Hennessy University of Virginia

It is obvious that Mr Cramer has the 'ability' to take the 'leap of faith'
I have listened to several of the men involved in this study and even they
claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth'

I put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies' or 'surveys'
they have limited subsets of individuals and there is alot of skewing due
to improper selection methods and the bias of the people involved in the
studies on both sides subject and researcher

Would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked  Would 
you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal
rate this applies to heterosexual men  In fact as one gay man and one
straight man put it men lie about the number of partners because that's
the thing to do our culture for the male almost requires this type of
response  It may seem harmless and silly but carries a large emotional
and mental price tag

I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' 
conquest  They just have to look good to one another at least in their
eyes  But also know that alot of this does go on there are many college
males hetero having a lot of sex with different partners

The word some sums it up alot of scientist have concluded that without a
doubt Global Climate willis occurring and should be dealt with by source

Without a doubt some warming will occur However there is mucho disagreement
on how much warming will occur
The original doomsdayers were claiming  to  degrees Farhenheit Lately
they have been saying  degrees Newer studies hint that it might be less
than a degree

Of course then there's the other side An article in yesterday's Atlanta
Journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the 
data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is
faulty The point that the article made is that all long term temperature
dataa collected has been in urban areas and that any heat rise can be
attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area They called it
the asphalt temperature trend We have no real long term data on remote
areas such as the middle of the Amazon rain forest or the top of Mt Everest
or the Gobi desert for that matter An accompanying article mentioned that
a group of scientists at NASA had developed a method for using a satellite
to collect temperature data globally and that preliminary results showed
a slight downward trend attributed to the Mt Pinatubo eruption It went
on to say that even with the current downward trend there appeared to be
NO change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at
least the next  years

occurred  It was actions in pursuit of that end that he was pardoned

accused of alot more than that Let me list it for you

I challenge you to provided any evidence that Nicon was officially

Tell that to the House That WAS the charge Or are you going to challenge

nothing to do with coveringup for Watergate You have been proved wrong
again But I don't expect you to believe this since your arrogance has

Loyalty to people who worked for him

This would be funny if it weren't so sad that you actually believe this
In his loyalty he allowed the people who worked for him to take the 
rap while he idly sat by and let it happen If he REALLY was loyal to
the people who worked for them he would have pardoned them before he 
resigned

Well it really doesn't matter anyway because I really don't care what liars
think of me anyway What Did I call you liars You want proof I'd be
glad to provide it I'm really sure which ones of you said these things 
since you all sound the same anyway 
 
	One of you said Nixon didn't start ANY secret wars
 
This is a lie Nixon had full knowledge of the invasions of Laos and
Cambodia and then lied to the American public about it
 
Note however that these were military actions but not wars

What a JOKE You can't actually believe what you just said Can you We 
bombed and invaded these countries

Notice the definition of war from the American Heritage Dictionary
	 A state or period of armed conflict between nations or states
This qualifies the invasions of Cambodia and Laos as wars
 
	One of you said Nixon didn't use the office of the presidency
  for personal gain
 
This is a lie The Senate committee issued an indictment that listed
Nixon's crimes The relevant ones were 
 Violating his oath of office
 ABUSING HIS PRESIDENTIAL POWERS
 
Excuse me but neither of these refer to personal gain

Then let me explain this to you REALLY slowly Why did he abuse the 
powers of his position Could it have been to gain personal political 
power Naw that would be too obvious
 
	So now you're BIG thing that you have been flogging me with
is that I mistook PRC for People's Republic of Cambodia Since I knew
that Cambodia was socialist at the time and since your comment was
right in middle of a conversation about Cambodia I made the wrong
assumption that we were talking about the same thing
 
Ah but Garrett anyone who has to make assumptions about the meaning
of the initials PRC in a discussion about Asia is breathtakingly
ignorant  

And anyone who can only call names because his position is defensless is
breathtakingly ignorant and desperate I noticed that you edited out the
other points were I proved you and Phil to be completely wrong

Here are several shreds of evidence that prove the Waco disaster
is the government's fault

  They raided an American's property because of rumors about
    Koresh's intentions with some converted yet still ndamendment
    protected firearms a judgeapproved warrant justifies nothing
 
In a democracy under the rule of law a search warrant justifies a 
search
 
The US constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to 
mount a search for illegally held weapons

A search for illegally held weapons IF there were any no evidence yet
produced to this effect does not justify firing into a house with
women and children either It also does not justify shooting first
without identifying oneself the ATF and FBI have done this before so
don't say they haven't please or producing a warrant

Guess it depends on whose story one believes huh

 
  It took them  days to think of a basic terrorist tactic ie
    tear gas and this could only be justified in support of rescuing
    any supposed hostages' inside
 
The Govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases Attempts to 
capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others

Which others are we talking about here

is one In this case they used sub lethal force 

Sub lethal Excuse me but those people are dead

  The gov't immediately imprisoned these socalled hostages'
 
The children were held hostage 

Evidence So far the FBI has produced none Don't hold your breath

The adults were wanted variously for murder and conspiracy to murder

Only a few of those being held in chains and shackles are wanted  
The rest are being held for the crime of being material witnesses

  It took hundreds of gov't agents with taxfunded cellular phones
    ten minutes to dial  for the fire department
 
They should not have called the fire dept at all There was no role
for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might
well shoot at them

It was not the Feds decision to make but the firefighters

Calling the fire dept meant that WACO was deprived
of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation 
where it could have been used arisen

This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by
ANY citizen Since fire departments do answer calls that deprive 
resources that might be needed elsewhere it is not a valid reason for
not calling them

Further since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in
a court of law they are subject to the same protection as any other
citizen And las far as I know even criminals in prison are not left to 
burn to death in a fire

  By cutting off the water supply in the surrounding area the gov't
    guaranteed that any fire at the compound would be fatal
 
Any fire started deliberately uising lamp oil is likely to be fatal

I guess this is a matter of religious faith with you The government
says it so it must be so Or haven't you been reading this thread well 
enough to notice that some of us here don't beleive their story

  No one had the foresight to station rescue vehicles nearby in the
    first place
 
They are a scarce resource A bunch of psychos cannot deprive the neighbourhood
of a resource that might be required in a genuine case

Patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires either
Besides as I explained some of us here believe their distress might
have been genuine Are you SO certain it wasn't

  The gov't conveniently forgot all that freedom of religion' stuff
 
Freedom of religion does not include human sacrifice Nor does it
include other forms of murder

There is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice 
either before of after the initial raid And selfdefense is not
murder

  The gov't arguably started or at least fanned the fire themselves 
 
The govt arguably is run by communists or the trilateral commission

He did not say it was deliberate Accidents do not require conspiracy
theories only wanton disregard for human life The initial raid alone
agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce
ment procedure proves they did not mind killing people

 Finally and this may be a stretch for some of you statists out there
    but Koresh's original reasons for holing up in such a compound may
    have something to do with the continual interference from the gov't
     new taxes new regulations and increasing involvement in every
    aspect of our personal and economic lives  Life on a compound might
    become the way of the future  it might have to be
 
Let us hope that those who support Koresh are not allowed to enforce this upon
the rest of us 

No one here is supporting Koresh We are opposing the illegal use of
excessive violence by our government against our citizens That is all

Their reasons for supporting the ownership of high power
weaponry are clear enough they hope that this will be the catylist for
the destruction of the fabric of society and allow them to enforce their
nightmare vision of the future

A society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious
views will destroy itself in due time It is the feds who disrupted the
fabric of society in Waco not Koresh It is the feds who forced a
nightmare onto the people of Mount Carmel

It would be a good thing for people to study history 

On what basis do you assume we haven't Don't you really mean
It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from
history that I do 

In particular a group of militant

Militant implies acts of aggression against one's neighbors The
Davidians left their neighbors alone

religious heretics who left to set up such a community
some time ago A few years latter they had captured Medina and destroyed
the idols in the Kabba Within ten years the whole of Arabia was under
Islam

So what The Mormons were considered a cult for years and were chased
out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are
advocating When they finally got to set up a community they left
people alone So far Americans haven't been put to the sword by Mormon
hordes crying to avenge Joseph Smith 

Just because a group of people start by saying that all they want is to be 
left alone does not mean that that is how they will stay 

It doesn't mean they won't either Anyway the whole purpose of a 
system of laws is to punish people for what they DO not what they
MIGHT do 

The Pat Robertsons
Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggarts of this world are quite telling other
people how to run their lives

Telling is not the same as forcing When the police knock at my
door I cannot make them go away by changing the channeI As for Pat
and friends I don't even WATCH their channel since I am an atheist
So far not watching them tell me what to do hasn't gotten me killed 

 If you allow such people to get guns and
point them in your face you are likely to find that they are running your
life

Right now the only people sticking guns in anyone's faces is the 
government And they are trying very hard to run my life Or 
haven't you noticed

Assuming for the sake of argument that the Branch Davidian
people immolated themselves in the manner described by the
Federal authorities why does the general consensus appear to
be that they  the BD  were insane Is it the manner of their
behaviour before they died or the fact they chose to kill
themselves rather than submit to the Government

I ask this question because there is a tradition and one that
is highly regarded by many people that several hundred Jews
elected to throw themselves off a cliff at Masada rather than
submit to Roman rule The circumstances at Masada and those at
Waco would seem in general terms quite similar and yet so far
as I'm aware nobody has seriously suggested that the Jews were
insane

The point of this comparison is to question the use of the word
'cult' in discussing the events at Waco Why were the Davidians
a cult and not the Jews at Masada What constitutes a cult Is
it the size of the membership or a matter of respectability or
perhaps the length of time it's been in existence Are the
Catholics a cult How about the Mormons or the Calvinists Is
a sect a respectible cult

Dictionary definitions aside since popular usage seems to carry
more weight I suspect that the word 'cult' is used in a perjorive
sense when speaking of groups like the Davidians It is rather
like the word 'boss' when used to describe someone unpopular 
or someone the government wishes to make unpopular  like say
Castro the Communist boss of Cuba One doesn't hear Clinton
described as America's Democratic or Capitalist boss



Well for one thing most if not all the Dividians depending on whether
they could show they acted in selfdefense and there were no illegal
weapons could have gone on with their life as they were living it
No one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their
legal weapons The Dividians had survived a change in leadership
before so even if Koresch himself would have been convicted and
sent to jail they still could have carried on
 
I don't think the Dividians were insane but I don't see a reason
for mass suicide if the fire was intentional set by some of the
Dividians We also don't know that if the fire was intentionally
set from inside was it a generally know plan or was this something
only an inner circle knew about or was it something two or three
felt they had to do with or without Koresch's knowledgeblessing etc
I don't know much about Masada Were some people throwing others over
Did mothers jump over with their babies in their arms

missing the entire point of my post

 kebarnesmsuvxmemstedu wrote

 Given that

  The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for
 much of the crime which afflicts our nation

 There is much evidence that it is the fact that the drugs are illegal not
 the drugs themselves that have caused the violence Witness prohibition
 and the violence that surrounded the trade in alcohol

No joke

  People who want drugs particularly people who
 are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get
 them whether or not they are legally available

 This is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal

Noyoujumped tothatconclusion  It's actually an argument as
to how to accomplish the societal good of discouraging drug use
without violating individual rights

  Despite current law enforcement efforts drugs
 are readily available to those who want them

 This is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal

No Youmissed the point  The point is the War On Drugs
is a failure and is counterproductive

  Addiction to drugs boh legal and illegal is
 responsible for a significant drain on the productive
 resources of our country and this occurs in a variety
 of ways from the cocaineaddicted babies who are
 unable to learn to the spread of disease among
 addicts to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse
 and tobacco smoking

 The crack baby scenario has been thouroughly discredited It
 just so happens that the symptoms seen in the crack babies are
 identical to fetal alcohol syndrome And the mothers who admitted
 to taking crack also admitted to drinking heavily during pregnancy

 In this country people are free to be stupid if they want to

But they are not free to be stupid and injure other people
Admittedly the fetal righttolife is outside the scope of
this discussion  However it's ridiculous to assert as you
apparently do that cocaine hasno effecton the developing
fetal nervous system  Caffiene and nicotine have fetal effects
too why should cocaine be any exception

  A general economic principle of government is
 that whatever is subsidized you get more of and
 whatever is taxed you get less of  To be most
 effective in confronting the nation's drug problem
 some way must be found to utilize these additional
 powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use
 less attractive

 So make the drugs legal tax them and use the tax money to fund a program
 to tell people how studid drugs are It has worked for the legal drugs

If you had read my article before writing your kneejerk response
you would have seen that this is exactly what I advocated

 While this country's current efforts to combat
 legal drugs have succeeded in some respects there is
 a greater awareness of the health consequences of
 smoking and designateddriver programs have helped
 reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot be
 said for the war on illegal drugs  There remains a
 core group of illegal drug users which support
 international networks of smugglers pushers growers
 processors kingpins and gangsters  These networks
 and their marketing activities which include drive
 by shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities
 and smuggling weapons are directly or indirectly
 responsible for a large proportion of the crimes
 committed in our country every day

 Each and every one of these problems is a direct result of the
 drug trade being illegal

No shit Sherlock


 Clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are
 linked  It takes only a moment's reflection to
 recognize how they are linked  The link is money  As
 with this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol
 consumption a black market has been created in which
 greedy local monopolies like the gangsters of a
 bygone era have profited enormously from their
 illegal trade  The victims of this trade include not
 only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be
 caught in the crossfire but I would argue the drug
 users themselves

 A great argument for making drugs legal

Thank you  How could you have missed the point so utterly
Whathaveyou been smoking

 Here then is my proposal

  Possession and use of all presently illegal
 drugs is decriminalized but buying and selling them
 remains illegal  'Potheads' can grow their own
 marijuana as many already do today other drug users
 can legally import their poison of choice as long as
 they pay the tariffs and a barter economy of drug
 experimenters develops

 Your solution has done nothing to eliminate the violence in
 the drug trade  BTW how is someone going to import a drug
 if buying it is illegal  I think you need to think your solution
 through a little more thouroughly

Obviously importers will not be buying drugs in the US under
US jurisdiction  Use your remaining brain cells

  Because of the barter economy which supplies
 the drug users the black market profits that have so
 enriched the drug lords dwindle  If these drugs can
 be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing why buy
 them  Nevertheless there will be those who will seek
 to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively
 low prices  Therefore

 You have failed to indicate how these drugs can be obtained for
 free or next to nothing You have stated that the sale of them
 is illegal

OK I'll spell it out for you  Barter economy means that
drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically
anything they choose or to buy it outside the US and bring
it in if it won't grow here  They will also be permitted to
trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they
themselves grow or manufacture  They will not however be able
to legally sell their drugs for money  Both manufacture and
importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed to discourage
their use This is your brain on drugs Any questions

  Law enforcement activity is concentrated on
 those individuals who continue to buy and sell and
 also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to
 afford even low prices  But here is where the
 strategy begins to differentiate between the drug
 dealers the victimizers and the drug users their
 victims

 In most cities this is already the strategy It has already
 failed and is dragging the rest of us down with it

Pardon me but possessionuse of these drugs is still a crime
You cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek
treatment and the comparative ease with which it could be
made available today when these drugs are illegal to possessuse
with what it would be were theynotillegal to possessuse
Decriminalizing possession and use makes treatmentmucheasier
Drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who
are prone to addiction and as such the drug users should be
left alone not thrown in prison along with their victimizers
Drugdealersare the criminals and should be treated as such
Drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your
criminal actions however

  Upon arrest foranycrimesuspects are
 permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a
 drug test  Those who choose to cooperate are informed
 that upon conviction for the crime they are accused
 of if they are found to be a drug user they will be
 institutionalized until they are clean and only then
 will they begin to serve their sentence  If they
 choose to cooperate and are already drugfree they
 can begin to serve their sentence right away  Those
 who choose not to undergo the drug test and are
 convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer
 sentences

 This sounds a hell of a lot like self incrimination Which is
 unconstitutional  If drug use is legal in your scheme why should
 the presence of drugs in anyones system influence the penalty they
 receive Much too big brotherish for my tastes

The drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary not coerced
and does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V
Those convicted who are drug users as evidenced by the test
are in need of treatment for their problem  Institutionalization
of these adddicted criminals is I would argue the best way to
help them straighten out  If they refuse the test and are convicted
their sentence can be appropriately harsher since they unlike the
addict have no excuse for their crimes

  Institutionalization of drug using criminals
 serves several purposes

 Drug using criminals and this includes drunk
 andor 'stoned' drivers are separated from their
 sources of supply thus reducing the total number of
 drug users in society at large and consequently
 decreasing the demand for drugs on the street putting
 more of the remaining drug dealers out of business

 Why should drug using criminals be treated any different from
 other criminals you have already stated that drug use is legal

 MarkWilsonAtlantaGANCRcom

Why not  My objective is to discourage drug useandcriminal
behavior  If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a
harsher sentence if they are convicted why is that not a good
thing  If fewer drug dealers who are still criminals BTW
can find victims why is that not a good thing  If fewer drug
users such as drunks 'potheads' etc commit crimes out of
fear of being cut off from their sources of supply why is that
not a good thing

I'm certainly willing to debate my position
You have to read it carefully though

   Steve proposes a system of checking what other nations are in to
   as criteria for what our government should try

   I counter that the limits of the constitution might be a better
   place to check
 
  Gee Jim if you'll check the Constitution you'll find in order to
  promote the general welfaredo ordain and establish this Constitution
  I'm surprised you missed it  It's right there in the first paragraph  I
  would have thought you would have made it at least through the preamble
 
 You almost got it right and it was a good try but you should follow your
 own advice  The PREAMBLE to the CONSTITUTION does read as you have quoted
 but let us not forget that after all it is only the preamble  It is not
 a binding part of the Constitution and carries no weight in the law  That 
 poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages 
 in the English language  witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who
 think those vague flowery phrases are part of the law of the land  Do you
 really believe that a politician only has to give lip service to promoting
 the general welfare to be within the limits of the constitution
 
 Sorry buddy but some other blowhards managed to include the general
 welfare in another portion of the constitution
 
 Article I Section  The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect
 taxesto pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL
 WELFARE of the United States
 
 I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
 said in the preamble
 
 Just to make sure you've got the point let's do a little experiment  What
 if the constitution read as follows
 Preamble We the people to promote the general Welfare do ordain
           and establish this Constitution for the United States of
           America
 Constitution  The Federal Government shall have one function and one
                function only  to provide for the defense of the nation
 The government would not then have two functions defense and Welfare  
 
 But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
 in Article I Section  I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
 functions  Right

Steve I'm glad to see that you abandoned the preamble thing  What did
you do a word search to find Welfare somewhere else in the constitution

my comments and paraphrases in brackets

Article I Section   in some ways the guts of the constitution

The Congress shall have the Power

 To lay and collect Taxes Duties Imposts and Excises 
       to pay the Debts indebtedness as defined in the document
       and provide for the common Defence Defence as precisely defined
       and general Welfare as defined through the document mostly in ways
                           that limit the government
         of the United States but the above taxes shall be uniform through
                               out the US

    so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly

     then  

  To borrow Money 
  To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations interstate and Indian tribes
  To do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies
  To coin Money regulate the Value thereof and etc
  To punish counterfeiters
  To establish Post Offices and post Roads
  To provide patents and copyrights
  To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court
 To define and punish Piracies and etc
 To declare War and etc
 To raise and support Armiesbut for no longer than two years at a stretch
 To provide and maintain a Navy notice no time limit on this one
 To make the rules for the army and navy
 To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws etc
 To provide for training of the army except for some state stuff
 To exercise exclusive Legislation in DC
 To make all Laws necessary to execute the foregoing Powers

Your original instinct was right  Looking to other nations for precedents
that support an expansive liberal agenda is much easier than looking to the
slim pickins found in the constitution

he will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia  And at  
pm he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel  There will be a photo 
op at the top of that meeting no formal press conference afterwards
	     
	     Any questions
	     
	     Q	  Is he moving towards some major decision this week 
on Bosnia
	     
	     MS MYERS  As we've said he's continuing to discuss 
his options  He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy 
advisors his Bosnia advisors as well as with other world leaders  
He'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today and he'll 
continue to discuss it  We don't have any specific timetable but 
obviously the situation there is very serious
	     
	     Q	  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe he's spoken to her today
	     
	     Q	  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly 
except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at  
pm
	     
	     MS MYERS  He did  He answered a question about it 
yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Before anything had happened
	     
	     MS MYERS  Before anything happened  He put out 
	     
	     Q	  Since something has happened he's had nothing to 
say
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's put out a statement on it last night  
And we'll have more to say about it later today
	     
	     Q	  In what forum is that going to be
	     
	     MS MYERS  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden
	     
	     Q	  He will talk about Waco at that
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes he'll have something to say
	     
	     Q	  Is that something we can take live
	     

	     MS MYERS  I think it will be brief  We can talk a 
little later about the exact structure as we work it out  But I 
don't know if it's something you'd want to take live
	     
	     Q	  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as 
well
	     
	     MS MYERS  He'll probably take a few
	     
	     Q	  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the 
Attorney General
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'll have to doublecheck  I don't know 
that he hasn't talked to her this morning
	     
	     Q	  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or 
anyone else
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     
	     Q	  And he didn't talk yesterday
	     
	     Q	  What's the reaction to her resignation statement 
that she made last night
	     
	     MS MYERS  She was asked a question about it and she 
answered the question  The President has absolutely no intention of 
asking for the Attorney General's resignation  He stands behind her 
 percent  As you know he was informed about the decision  He 
takes full responsibility for that and stands  percent behind 
Attorney General Reno
	     
	     Q	  The question now arises  yesterday we were told 
that he was briefed on this but we never got a firm idea of how much 
he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and 
the justification of the timing  Was he fully informed on all of 
that all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the 
compound that made them want to go now the feeling that nothing else 
was going to succeed et cetera
	     
	     MS MYERS  He talked with the Attorney General about 
the decision about  she talked to him about the factors that led 
to her decision  He raised no objections  He supports her decision 
to go forward with it  He was fully briefed
	     
	     Q	  Of course hindsight is  but looking back 
now does the President does the White House feel that the decision 
he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at 
what actually happened
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think everybody feels bad when life is 
lost  But I don't think that that is reason to secondguess the 
decision  He stands behind the decision that was made  He was 
informed about it  He was fully briefed about it and he stands  
percent behind the Attorney General the Justice Department and the 
FBI  It's a difficult operation and there's  it had already gone 
on for more than seven weeks  Four federal agents had lost their 
lives in the line of duty  let's not forget that  
	     
	     This was a very difficult situation and all the 
decisions involved were very difficult  But all the agents on the 
ground the FBI the Justice Department all recommended moving 
forward with this  They thought given the circumstances it was the 
best possible course of action  There's just no point in second
guessing those decisions  Now I think that there's a reason 
	     
	     Q	  Why not  They have to 
	     

	     MS MYERS  No not to secondguess the decisions  I 
think it's important to take a look at it to have an investigation  
I think the President will talk some about that later today  But at 
this  from this vantage point to secondguess those decisions 
it's not useful
	     
	     Q	  You sound like he's going to order an investigation 
of what happened and whether 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think he'll have more to say about that 
later yes
	     
	     Q	  He will order an investigation
	     
	     MS MYERS  He'll have more  yes  he'll have more to 
say about an investigation
	     
	     Q	  What kind of investigation
	     
	     MS MYERS  He'll have more to say about it later
	     
	     Q	  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking surely 
there is some soulsearching now as to whether it was the right 
decision  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned 
out to be a rather  a debacle
	     
	     MS MYERS   I think we'll  obviously we'll review 
the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome  
I don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic  But 
again the President stands behind the decisions that were made and 
we'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that
	     
	     Q	  What was the FBI Director's role in this
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well he was obviously involved in setting 
up the operation  He signed off on it as did the agents that were 
on the ground that were working with him  I don't believe he spoke 
to the President but I'll doublecheck that
	     
	     Q	  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of 
planning and so forth
	     
	     MS MYERS  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what 
aspects he was involved with
	     
	     Q	  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House 
today
	     
	     MS MYERS  There's no planned meeting  I don't believe 
that she'll be here
	     
	     Q	  She won't be at this event at  pm
	     
	     MS MYERS  No no plans to be
	     
	     Q	  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on 
on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in 
terms of  to the President's detriment politically
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well I would certainly hope that people 
wouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons  Obviously I 
think again that it's useful to look at the facts to reevaluate 
the facts and I think the President will move forward with that  
But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of 
decisions that it was a very difficult situation that it was caused 
by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four 
federal agents   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent 

children lost their lives in this  I don't think anybody disputes 
the tragedy of the outcome
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee what was the White House role in handling 
the I guess public relations aspect  in the aftermath  Who was 
talking  who here at the White House was talking with people at 
Justice to set up Reno's news conference to do all that sort of 
thing
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think the Attorney General handled her end 
of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the 
news conference once there was a point at which there was enough 
information I think to talk with some accuracy about what had 
transpired during the day  Obviously people here at a number of 
levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department 
and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening 
there
	     
	     Q	  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the 
President and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to 
anybody at the White House  So who 
	     
	     MS MYERS  There were people talking on a staffto
staff level
	     
	     Q	  I understand  But who at the Justice Department 
was handling that for Reno  Who was talking to the White House
	     
	     MS MYERS  There were a number of people  As you know 
Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House and I know he talked 
to a number of people here  There were a number of people at a 
number of different levels involved  I don't want to get into 
exactly who had what conversations with whom but there were a number 
of conversations  Obviously the Justice Department was working to 
keep the White House informed the press informed to the best of its 
ability as events unfolded throughout the day
	     
	     Q	  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe so  I don't know if he 
talked  he may have at one point
	     
	     Q	  And was the White House role just to seek 
information about what happened or was it to direct the public 
information campaign that followed
	     
	     MS MYERS  It was both to keep abreast of the situation 
so the President could be on top of it but I think the Justice 
Department managed its press relations on it  We were obviously very 
interested in what was happening there throughout the day and the 
President was following it very closely throughout the day
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee on that though if the President was 
following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet 
Reno why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again I don't know if he's talked to her 
this morning  Again he's kept fully aware of what has been going on 
throughout the day  He stands  percent behind her decisions  
He's been fully supportive of her as he said yesterday morning 
before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written 
statement
	     
	     Q	  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to 
her personally yesterday
	     
	     MS MYERS  One more time I don't know if they've 
spoken this morning

	     
	     Q	  No yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung 
out to dry all day yesterday
	     
	     MS MYERS  That's just not true  I think we said 
throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility that 
he stands  I don't know how much clearer we can be  The President 
stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this  He accepts 
full responsibility for the events that transpired  He believes that 
Janet Reno the Justice Department and the FBI acted as best they 
could given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the 
time  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her 
 percent
	     
	     Q	  One of the best indications of that is to pick up 
the phone and tell her
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again I don't know whether they've spoken 
this morning
	     
	     Q	  Why can't we find out
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well we can  I can't do it standing here 
right now
	     
	     Q	  You've got six people here  All they've got to do 
is pick up the phone
	     
	     MS MYERS  Helen we'll get back to you
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee when the President spoke with the Attorney 
General on Sunday is it safe to assume that either she volunteered 
or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to 
increasing pressure on the Davidians
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that they discussed the situation  
Again I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly 
she told him but I think that he was aware of the risks involved
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee the President yesterday morning said it 
was entirely her decision  She then said that she told him what was 
happening and he said okay  Does the President regard it that he 
gave the goahead or that she gave the goahead
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think what they both said yesterday was 
that she made a decision based on all the available facts  She 
informed him about that and he raised no objections  Again I don't 
know how much clearer we can be about that
	     
	     Q	  And he said okay  The issue is over the 
responsibility
	     
	     MS MYERS  He said okay
	     
	     Q	   Does okay mean 

	     MS MYERS  The President accepts ultimate 
responsibility
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee the President's investigation that he's 
going to announce  would that be conducted by someone outside the 
administration
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     

	     Q	  It would be internal  is it meant to preclude any 
congressional investigation
	     
	     MS MYERS  No it's meant simply to follow up on the 
incidents that occurred yesterday
	     
	     Q	  And you would I assume therefore cooperate fully 
with any congressional hearings that would be held
	     
	     MS MYERS  To the best of our ability
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee there are two reports out this morning  
One that the Justice Department or FBI or whomever apparently had 
a bug planted inside the complex  And the other is that the children 
may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either 
left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire  
What do you know about those two 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts 
this morning  We may get more on it later but at this point I know 
 I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by 
people who came out of the compound
	     
	     Q	  Has the President received any report today in 
terms of fatalities and actually what was going on  what they've 
been able to find out on in the compound now
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's been briefed  I don't think that 
they've gotten into the compound yet  They were still waiting for it 
to cool off  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported 
in the news accounts  But he has been kept uptodate on it
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee the President stands behind Attorney 
General Reno but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from 
the socalled experts
	     
	     MS MYERS  He believes that she made  he stands 
behind the decision that she made  It was the unanimous decision of 
her advisors of the FBI of the agents on the ground and he 
supports that
	     
	     Q	  What about the validity of the decisions made on 
the ground  Does he back those 
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's not going to secondguess decisions 
made
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee you just said he stands behind the 
decision which she made  Normally in a situation like this the 
President says I  made the decision  But you're saying she made the 
decision
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'm saying that the President was briefed 
about the decision  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility 
for it
	     
	     Q	  But then why do you keep using the terminology the 
decision that she made rather than the decision that he made 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Because as he said yesterday she evaluated 
the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department 
and FBI which is part of the Justice Department and made a decision 
and then briefed the President on that decision  That is how the 
chain of command works  She briefed him  He signed off on it  The 
operation went forward and the President accepts full 
responsibility
	     

	     Q	  In that chain of command analogy there I want to 
go back to Sessions a moment  Do you know if this was a plan that 
came through him to Reno or was it presented to her around him or 
with his involvement  What was his involvement
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again you'd have to go to the Justice 
Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General 
and the Director
	     
	     Q	  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions
	     
	     MS MYERS  He supports  again I don't know how many 
different ways I can say this  he supports the decisions made by 
the Justice Department and the FBI  He fully supports the Attorney 
General in this  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI 
I want to  but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him the one who 
made the decisions as the head of the Justice Department  As you 
know the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General  The 
Attorney General made the decision  She informed the President about 
those decisions  He okayed it  He didn't raise any objections to 
it and he accepts full responsibility
	     
	     Q	  Do you have based on what you know here at the 
White House any concerns about William Sessions' performance during 
this 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing to suggest that no
	     
	     Q	  Along those same lines just in your initial review 
of the situation how much do you think the problems might have come 
from not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having 
an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status    
	     
	     MS MYERS  I just don't think that had anything to do 
with it  I think the agents on the ground  the operation went 
forward  I'm not going to speculate on that
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet 
Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to 
speak to Clinton
	     
	     MS MYERS   No  She was carrying forward her 
responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday  I 
think she did a very admirable job  The President agrees with that
	     
	     Q	  Before Sunday how often was the President briefed 
on the situation in Waco
	     
	     MS MYERS  He was kept updated on a regular basis on a 
daily basis
	     
	     Q	  Who briefed the President
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well I'm not going to get into exactly who 
what conversations he had with whom but he was kept uptodate on 
the events in Waco  He has daily briefings on a number of issues
	     
	     Q	  No no was this a regular briefing conducted by a 
White House staff person or was it by a Justice Department person
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's briefed regularly by a White House 
staff on a number of issues  Again I'm not going to get into 
exactly who briefs him on what subjects
	     
	     Q	  Another subject
	     
	     Q	  On another subject
	     

	     
	     Q	  Now we're going to do gays in the military  
Laughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  I welcome it
	     
	     Q	  How close are you to signing the biodiversity 
treaty
	     
	     MS MYERS  As you know the President's giving a speech 
on Earth Day tomorrow  We'll have more to say about it then
	     
	     Q	  Any details on where or when that speech is yet
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's at  am and I don't know where 
yet
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee is this a major policy address  How would 
you characterize the speech tomorrow
	     
	     MS MYERS  I would characterize it as a Earth Day 
speech  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past 
positions on these things  But again I don't want to get too much 
into what he's going to talk about tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  On or off campus
	     
	     Q	  Is this at a location outside the White House
	     
	     MS MYERS  It will be somewhere in Washington  We 
don't know exactly where yet
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee what foreign leaders has the President 
talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Only Prime Minister Major  And again he'll 
try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning
	     
	     Q	  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today 
 both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work 
that the Serbs are not going to sign on  Does the administration 
still believe that it can work and that they will sign on
	     
	     MS MYERS  Obviously the ultimate goal is some sort of 
peaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia  As you know the 
administration is considering a wide variety of options at this 
point  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of 
Eastern Bosnia is quite serious  And the President will meet with 
his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this
	     
	     Q	  Is that a question they're going to try to be 
deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again they'll be reviewing a number of 
options including the peace plan
	     
	     Q	  Does the group that he's meeting with today include 
Reg Bartholomew
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe he's here  But it will be 
among the usual  Secretary Christopher Secretary Aspin General 
Powell
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee do you have anything on the apparent 
encounter by US Fs over Bosnia today  some aircraft violating 
the nofly zone
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I don't  I'll get back to you on that

	     
	     Q	  Will the President be meeting with every one of the 
leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum
	     
	     MS MYERS  He will  He'll be meeting as you know 
with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow and then with 
the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon
	     
	     Q	  As a group or one by one
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe it's as a group  Now Havel and 
Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for 
quite some time  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of 
state that are here
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee has the President decided whether he 
supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act  And has anything been 
worked out for him to address the march on Sunday
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think he'll probably have a letter or some 
kind of a statement to the march  We haven't worked out the exact 
details of that
	     
	     Q	  Not a live phone hookup
	     
	     MS MYERS  Probably not given the logistics of getting 
to Boston  The speech as you know is at  pm  The answer to 
the other part of your question is no he hasn't taken a position on 
it
	     
	     Q	  You said that speech in Boston was at  pm
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe so yes
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what it's on
	     
	     MS MYERS  We'll still working out 
	     
	     Q	  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam  
When will he be meeting with the President
	     
	     MS MYERS  No specific meeting is scheduled  We'll 
talk to him at some point and see  We look forward to his report 
but exactly how he'll make that report is unclear
	     
	     Q	  So he's not going to come immediately to the White 
House
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     
	     Q	  The AIDS czar  how close are you
	     
	     MS MYERS  Still working on it
	     
	     Q	  Drug czar
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect it before the march
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't have a time line on it
	     
	     Q	  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the 
Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe so
	     
	     Q	  Why not
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's just not going to

	     
	     Q	  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour
	     
	     MS MYERS  No that's tomorrow  tomorrow at  am
	     
	     Q	  Update on the stimulus possible scaling down 
	     
	     MS MYERS  As you know the Senate will vote on 
amendments today  We'll continue to talk  The President is 
committed to some kind of a jobs package we'd like to see it passed  
And we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where 
we end up
	     
	     Q	  When this briefing is over can you give us word 
through the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to 
Janet Reno
	     
	     MS MYERS  We'll be happy to
	     
	     Q	  It's become a pressing question for the last 
several hours
	     
	     MS MYERS  No just this minute that I've been here 
and I haven't had a chance to follow up on it Helen
	     
	     Q	  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield
	     
	     MS MYERS  I mean obviously he prefers  he offered 
a compromise package of  billion  He believes that that's the 
best alternative believes that he's obviously willing to take a 
second look at the package  And I think the Senate will vote on that 
today and we're hopeful that the President's bill which will be the 
Mitchell amendment will be the one that will be approved
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee is there any White House official that 
will be at the march on Sunday
	     
	     MS MYERS  Somebody will be there representing the 
President  I don't know who yet
	     
	     Q	  Well has it been decided how he's going to 
address  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think it will probably be a letter but 
there hasn't been a final decision on that yet
	     
	     Q	  The official will read the letter is that what it 
sounds like
	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct
	     
	     Q	  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning  Do you 
know what was that about  Was that about this Waco thing
	     
	     MS MYERS  No actually it wasn't  It may have come 
up but it was about economic issues
	     
	     Q	  On health care  is the th of May still the 
target
	     
	     MS MYERS  That's still the target
	     
	     Q	  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress 
speech at the end of May 
	     
	     MS MYERS  We haven't resolved exactly how the 
President will present the health care plan to the people  I 
wouldn't rule that out as an option but no decisions have been made

Larry

Now you can't SERIOUSLY suggest that the US Government
would be affraid of a bunch of Vets and would UP and
call out the Military to PROTECT them just because the
US Government UP and decided to forget a generation of
veterans

Now what was that some liberal was saying about the
advantages of a conscripted armed forces which we need
not actually pay for services render



You should be aware that the US Army was called to fight
and did WW I veterans bonus marchers who marched on
DC demanding bonuses they were promised for service

 You might  except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than

 Okay Claytoon let us say that hypothetically I agree with you that
 gay men are much more promiscuous than straight men  Why does
 this indicate they are screwed up people
 
 BTW  It occurs to me that since in my experience men are much more
       interested in sex than women and want to have sex much earlier
       in a relationship than women do that homosexuals would have 
       sex more often simply becuase their partner is of a like mind
       ie heterosexual men would be more promiscuous if they could

It's my observation that women are more likely to me more strongly
indoctronated into now wanting sex that are men
Also there are definite double standards for men and women who are
promiscuous

Could there also be a factor of communication being more direct in 
homosexual relationships and culture

Wow I hadn't realized how VENOMOUS this was getting  Be careful herethe
problem isn't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich
rich

  But the values and systems that make the rich rich all basically
  amount to freedom of choice 

  In New England in  the entire economy was based on the small family
  farm   Farm economy households were economically diversified producing
  not only agricultural goods but also manufactured goods especially 
  cloth  Many farm women carded spun andor wove producing not only
  cloth for their own family but also to sell generating extra income

  But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England
  and by the 's it had moved to the US in both cases in the form 
  of textile mills  These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently
  and cheaply than people at home  

  The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out
  and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to 
  go to work in these same mills in Lowell Mass or Nashua NH where
  they worked  hour weeks in deafening dangerous conditions living 
  regimented lives and being exposed to cottondust and infectious dis
  eases due to the work

  Now people didn't HAVE to buy the cheaper factorymade cloth 
  They were free to keep buying the homemade variety and support
  their local economy    

 Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system
and make money everything ELSE we care about goes to shit

     but sorry for the cliche it takes two to tango   The big
  rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff
  It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also 
  its social center  You KNEW the merchants you did business with 
  or even local kids working behind the counter   You would see
  people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat

  Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop 
  at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of
  thousands or millions  You have no particular relationship with the
  companies you do business with and feel no particular commitment
  to them nor they to you   Major components of what defines a com
  munity have been destroyed   On the other hand the products we buy
  at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign
  manufacture and they are probably of better or at least more consistent
  quality


                                                           I have to
constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make
money  Money doesn't make us happy it just prevents certain things making
us more unhappy

Therefore don't shoot the rich  Shoot the conservatives

  Don't blame the conservatives for this  Everyone makes their own
  individual choice and the liberals and the fencesitters are just
  as guilty of pretending there are no social and cultural consequences
  to economic choices

I wonder where you have been getting your misinformation from Straight
from the BATF itself

Koresh and his followers did not capture the compound a few years ago it
has always been theirs A few years ago their was an argument over who should
lead the group a gunfight erupted one person died Koresh was charged
with the murder When the sheriff came to arrest him the sheriff knocked
on the dorr and showed Koresh the warrant a tactic that the BATF might try
learning Koresh and the others charged peacibly surrendered to the sherrif
A trial ensued the others were found innocent and the jury hung on Koresh's
charge

 	WASHINGTON UPI  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday
 there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than
 ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs but a frustrated senator
 told him to do just that

  Oh great

  Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting
  each other throughout central Bosnia in battles that the UN describes
  as out of control and atrocities being reported from both sides
  These people are crazy

  Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights
  and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the
  carrental business  if you're Number Two you just try harder

  The region doesn't need military aid it needs psychiatric help
  We should bomb them with Thorazine and then airdrop several 
  regiments of psychotherapists

  There is no justification for US military involvement because there
  is no reasonable definable goal we can achieve militarily  Sure
  if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably
  stop the more egregious fighting but only as long as we are willing
  to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at  The minute we 
  leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again
                                
  BTW with Bosnia's large Moslem population why have nations like 
  Turkey Saudi Arabia Syria Egypt and others with either money 
  or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered 
  to help out Bosnia   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said
  a thing or two but that's all I see no great enthusism from any 
  of those places to get their hands dirty    Why does the US always
  get stuck with this stuff

  Besides there's no case that can be made for US military involvement
  there that doesn't apply equally well to say Liberia Angola or
  it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign Cambodia   Nonwhites
  don't count

 It's quite possible that a buyer and seller will both
 trust some third party more than either trust the other and

 third party assumes the right to interfere in a transaction contarary
 to the wishes of the primary participants odds are pretty good the
 results will be detrimental
 
 So we try to ensure that the process of deciding whether to introduce
 third parties isn't random  As Steve said above there are examples
 where third parties are less ignorant or corrupt than the two
 primary parties should this knowledge not be able to help
 
A third party should be able to use persuasion to sway the transaction
If on the other hand we condone the use of force or threat of violence 
by the third party then we are in trouble  A fourth party could say 
that it knows better than parties   and   And a fifth party and 
so on  Who wins  The one that can use the force or threat of force the
best  In other words Might makes right  Let's abandon such
aggressive tactics and work from voluntary cooperation and respect from 
others  That is what libertarians want

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                             April       

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                IN PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH VACLAV HAVEL
	     
	     
                           The Oval Office 
	     

 PM EDT


	     Q	  Mr President President Havel is here for the 
Holocaust Museum opening and you toured the museum last night  All 
this focus on the Holocaust how does that weigh on your decision
making process as far as Bosnia is concerned
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I think the Holocaust is the most 
extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing  And I 
think that even in its more limited manifestations it's an idea that 
should be opposed  You couldn't help thinking about that  That's 
not to compare the two examples  They're not identical everyone 
knows that  But I think that the United States should always seek an 
opportunity to stand up against  at least to speak out against 
inhumanity
	     
	     Q	  Sir how close are you to a decision on more 
sanctions on Bosnia
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well of course we've got the UN 
vote  Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the UN vote to 
strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough  And we now are 
putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at 
what other options we ought to consider  And I don't have anything 
else to say except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on 
it and will continue to over the next several days
	     
	     Q	  Following your meeting today sir are you any 
closer to some sort of US military presence there
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I have not made any decisions
	     
                                                                  
	     
	     
	     Q	  President Clinton why have you decided to meet 
with Mr Havel
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I'm just honored that he would 
come and see me  I'm glad he's here in the United States for the 
dedication of the Holocaust Museum  He is a figure widely admired in 
our country and around the world and a very important person in 
Europe and a very important person to the United States  So I'm 
hoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic 
and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we 
believe in

   My comments were directed against those who see these sorts
   of incidents as proof that rights as we know them are about to 
   vanish

Many rights have disappeared For example the right to destroy your
own body in any way you desire as long as you do not injure others
or their property in the process is just about gone

  And what's your evidence that you had more such rights in 

  In those days people were ROUTINELY sent off to the county home
  for the feeblemindedconfused if they showed the slightest weirdness
  Remember all the jokes people used to make about the guys in the
  white coats and the big butterfly net coming to take you away

  That sort of thing used to really happen  Nowadays you can be a

I don't want to attack anyone's personal opinions and thus have not
included any articles  but it seems to me incredibly ridiculous
and pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight
and point fingers at Clinton Reno the FBI or whomever

First of all it is a kneejerk judgement  The facts are quite
muddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while

Secondly things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory
fingers  Pointing fingers is a destructive action  If everyone
sat around pointing fingers all the time nothing would get done
and nothing would ever get any better  And despite the tragedy
we can learn something from this  if it is approached in a 
constructive manner  Doesn't it seem that working together is
more productive than working against one another

Thirdly it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given
the benefit of hindsight  something that those who made the
decisions did not have the benefit of  Why not give them the courtesy
of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the
data they had  in a very very difficult situation  Some
responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done
without regard for the lives of the people in the compound  give
me a break

Be part of the solution  not the problem

And that's MY opinion

You are speculating that the FBI purposely started the fire  Please
if you've got such a ridiculously extraordinary claim and have no evidence
whatsoever at least give us a speculatory reason why the FBI would want to
do such a thing

The possibility that the fire was started accidentally is much more reasonable
but we don't have anything but contradictory anecdotal evidence right now
 
Isaac Kuo isaackuomathberkeleyedu	       


Mr Kuo I don't recall seeing your byline around much before at least
on tpm Let me clue you in on this newsgroup tpm is populated
largely by people whose hatred for the US government especially
the government of Mr Clinton is literally boundless To these
people the suggestion that agents of the US government would carry
out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens in full view of TV
cameras is not an 'extraordinary claim' It's just another day in
the life of these United States

They don't have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to
publicly massacre citizens Have you seen 'The Crying Game' 

	It's in their nature

 But if less than  of the population is gay what can we say about
 these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated gay
 potential  Obviously a large chunk of these people chose or more
 accurately were forced to choose by force of religion and social
 sanction to put those feelings aside to be heterosexual

 Obviously Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category

 I can't speak for Kaldis but force of religion and social sanction
 played no part in my sexual preferences  Neither had much influence on
 me as a teenager

You might as well have  You certainly would not have been in error if
you would have

I have indeed heard of Pythagoras but I don't know that he was ever
disparaged as a bean eater  In the American Southwest and West
eg Texas California Colorado the term bean eater is
sometimes used as a slur against those of Hispanic heritage generally
Mexicans in those parts  much like how the Irish in the Northeast
are perceived by some as voracious beer guzzlers

 The situation in Waco was similar to a hostage situation with 
 a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person
 In such a situation a person who provokes the madman and causes 
 him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the
 hostage  Janet Reno blindly stumbled in there and basically
 threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would
 release the hostage  It's no surprise that the madman would
 pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation

Just out of curiosity what else was there to do in this situation
Wait another  daysweeksmonthsyears

Was there anything indicating that these children and the other
people were going to get out alive

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                                  April  



                            PRESS BRIEFING
                           BY DEE DEE MYERS


                          The Briefing Room


 AM EDT
	     
	     
	     MS MYERS  At  pm we're having a press 
conference Bill in the East Room  And then Saturday the President 
will leave here at roughly  am and fly down to Jamestown  He 
will spend the day there overnight at Camp David 
	     
	     On Sunday it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave 
Camp David and fly to Boston  He'll leave from Hagerstown The press 
plane will leave from Washington 
	     
	     He will meet with some 
	     
	     Q	  What kind of a plane is that he's taking
	     
	     MS MYERS  That he's taking  He'll probably take a C

	     
	     Q	  From Hagerstown
	     
	     MS MYERS  From Hagerstown  Air Force One doesn't fly 
out of Hagerstown apparently
	     
	     Q	  How will the pool travel
	     
	     MS MYERS  The pool will have to meet him ahead of 
time  So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait 
for him at the airport  There is currently no provision  and I'll 
doublecheck because there's currently no provision  I think 
that's standard operating practice
	     
	     Q	  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get 
on the plane at Hagerstown
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe so
	     
	     Q	  What time does he have to be in Boston
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's going to meet there with a group of 
citizens mostly people who supported us during the campaign at 
around  pm  We're still working out the final times
	     
	     Q	  At the airport
	     
	     MS MYERS  No it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel  
	     And then he will also meet with some  a youth group 
that authored something called Project   The speech to the 
publishers is actually at  pm  It will be followed by QA  And 
then after the speech and QA he'll attend a reception with the 
publishers and then return to Washington from Boston  And that's it 
for the weekend
	     
	     Q	  Has the President seen the report from  or the 
letter communication from the foreign service officers also 
obviously the communication from Madeleine Albright  And what is 
his reaction to their call on him
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well obviously the letter was written to 
Secretary Christopher  I believe Secretary Christopher received the 
letter on Saturday  He reviewed it and met with the authors on 
Monday to discuss their views  He believes it's an important part of 
the policymaking process and is taking their views into account as 
we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy
	     
	     Q	  What is the President's reaction
	     
	     MS MYERS  The President hasn't seen the letter  It 
was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher  In 
terms of  he hasn't seen specifically the letter but in terms of 
their concerns generally what the President has said is that there 
are a lot of options on the table now including ones that weren't 
there before  And I think he's as is everybody gravely concerned 
about the situation in Bosnia
	     
	     Q	  Is he influenced by that  I mean how does he feel 
about the fact that all of the specialists in that area  those desk 
officers 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Many of the specialists in that area  I 
think that that is clearly part of the process  It's something  
their views will clearly be considered  I think Secretary 
Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views  I 
think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that 
those opinions ought to be considered particularly from people who 
work closely on the issues
	     
	     Q	  What do you mean there are options on the table 
that weren't there before
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think the President said last week that 
there were options such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian 
Muslims that had been previously off the table that are now being 
considered
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee in terms of those options Madeleine 
Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action 
by the US if the Europeans did not go along  Is that on the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well I can't discuss anything that would  
any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador 
Albright and the President  But I think the President has said he 
would certainly  is working with our European allies  He's had a 
number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build 
some consensus there  
	     
	     Q	  Will he reach a decision  will he have anything 
specific to say today
	     
	     MS MYERS  No  I mean in term of there will be no new 
announcement of policy today
	     
	     Q	  Does your statement mean he has ruled out 
unilateral action
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's continuing to consult with our allies 
at this point  He has said  I think he's been fairly clear about 
it that the he believes that the US needs to act in concert with 
its allies on this
	     
	     Q	  On that point does he believe that the US 
though does have builtin authority from the United Nations already 
to take unilateral action
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well I think the UN Resolution  makes 
it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian 
relief effort  I think the broader point is that anything we do any 
options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is 
consistent with UN authority and if it's not we'll work with our 
allies to make sure that we get it
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee then how does the White House someone as 
distinguished as Elie Wiesel who says that not enough is being done 
to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that that's why we're considering 
additional options  I think that Mr Wiesel's comments yesterday 
were quite compelling  The situation in Bosnia is tragic  The 
President is very concerned about it  He has  I think President 
Clinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to 
isolate Serbia in the world community  Clearly we're considering 
other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's 
not enough
	     
	     Q	  In terms of what you were just talking about it 
sounds like Resolution  justifies unilateral action by the US to 
protect humanitarian 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't think it  I wouldn't use the word 
justify  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting 
the delivery of humanitarian relief  But I think that's just an 
explanation of the resolution  I think any action that we take will 
be consistent with UN resolutions or we'll work with our allies to 
make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action
	     
	     Q	  The President and other officials have ruled out 
unilateral US action in Bosnia in the past  You're declining to do 
that this morning
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I said the President has said repeatedly 
that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this
	     
	     Q	  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone which 
has been said before explicitly
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't mean to imply a change in policy  
The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with 
our allies on this
	     
	     Q	  One other little question  Did he know about this 
letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe so  Secretary Christopher 
 they may have had a private conversation about it  The President 
has not seen it
	     
	     Q	  They met on Monday right  Christopher met 
surely he must have brought that up 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again they may have talked privately about 
it but 
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee what you're saying is that the Albright 
recommendation has been rejected is that correct
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I didn't say that at all  I said I 
won't  I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or 
communications
	     
	     Q	  She's advocating unilateral action and you're 
saying in effect that we will not take unilateral action
	     
	     MS MYERS  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine 
Albright may or may not have recommended
	     
	     Q	  Given the sometimes delicate complicated and 
frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue 
does the President find this kind of letter from  foreign service 
officers of the State Department helpful to that process hurtful to 
that
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that their views are obviously being 
considered  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two 
days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing 
of their views of the basis for their views to discuss in greater 
detail the options that they had presented in the letter
	     
	     Q	  Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on 
additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to 
act regardless of what the allies may or may not do
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think clearly there's a broad policy 
review underway now  And the President and his advisors are 
considering a number of options including some of those outlined in 
the letter from the folks over at the State Department  Now no 
decisions have been made on that yet but I think that there is a 
through review underway and that their opinions are being very 
seriously considered
	     
	     Q	  If I can just follow up I guess what I'm looking 
for is what was his reaction to this letter  Did he say good this 
bolsters my position  Or did he say damn this is just what I don't 
need right now
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think he said this helps contribute 
substantively to the debate  It's important that all views be 
considered and aired thoroughly that before he makes a decision he 
wants to have the best possible advice and information possible and 
this I think in many ways furthers that goal
	     
	     Q	  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the 
President  it's all open now and you wouldn't take any umbrage or 
say that they were out of line
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that the fact that Secretary 
Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they 
had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is 
conclusive evidence that their views are welcome
	     
	     Q	  Does the policy review include what Madeleine 
Albright has suggested and what Joe Biden and others have suggested 
which is that the previous UN resolutions authorize unilateral 
action  military action  for the delivery of humanitarian 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think all options are on the table
	     
	     Q	  The unilateral option is on the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think all options are on the table
	     
	     Q	  We've had two different 
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that a change Dee Dee
	     
	     Q	  That would be a change of policy
	     
	     Q	  Particularly if it includes ground troops which 
has been specifically ruled out
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think the President has been  well no  
I don't  that is not 
	     
	     Q	  Are you talking about all options
	     
	     MS MYERS  All options  I think the President has 
been fairly clear about that  So let me just review again what he 
has said  He has said that  the President has said all options are 
on the table with the exception of the introduction of ground 
troops which he has never suggested  He has ruled that out from the 
beginning
	     
	     Q	  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort
	     
	     MS MYERS  He has said that he doesn't believe the US 
can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself  I think 
that there are a number of very complicated options on the table 
right now  I don't think that  again I don't want to comment on 
specific options that are being considered other than in the broad 
categories that we've already said  things like lifting the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims things that I think we've talked 
about in broad terms  This is a very complicated situation  The 
options being presented and considered are very complicated
	     
	     Q	  Air strikes on the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again I think that's been fairly clearly 
pointed out that that's something that's being discussed
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee are ground troops on the  
	     
	     MS MYERS  No ground troops are not being considered
	     
	     Q	  You said there was not going to be  you said you 
were not announcing a change of policy  Then you said everything is 
on the table  We're confused  Are unilateral actions on the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  All I can tell you is what the President has 
said  that he doesn't believe  that he wants to act in concert 
with the allies on this
	     
	     Q	  Wants to but he's willing to  I mean if they 
don't go along 
	     
	     MS MYERS  He's continuing to consult with our allies 
on this  He's continuing to have discussions  He's continuing to 
press them for further action  And I think that's clear  The 
conversation is ongoing  We're going to continue to work with them 
to find the best possible solution and next step on this
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee the allies have taken the position that to 
conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite 
effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel 
that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid 
would become vulnerable and the Bosnians 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I'm not sure that's the consistent  I 
mean I'm not sure who you're referring to
	     
	     Q	  The British and the French
	     
	     Q	  Yes the British and French  They've taken the 
position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized 
by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military  Does the 
US believe differently from that
	     
	     MS MYERS  The President has had conversations with 
both Mitterrand and Major as you know  I think that there is a 
thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well  And I 
don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions 
other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as 
we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action  
And I think that process is ongoing
	     
	     Q	     the other day voted against any military 
intervention yesterday  Does the President regard that as the end of 
the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of 
unilateral action  The allies have been very very plain that they 
do not want to do anything
	     
	     MS MYERS  The consultations are ongoing  That's all I 
can tell you at this point
	     
	     Q	  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement 
on Bosnia today in the press conference
	     
	     MS MYERS  No that is not the intention of the press 
conference
	     
	     Q	  What is the intention
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's an opportunity to take questions  He 
may have a brief  I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement 
but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia  That 
will not happen
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening 
statement is
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's sort of a general statement of where we 
are
	     
	     Q	  After the first hundred days you mean
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's not a long statement  I mean this is 
just generally  Don't look for any major policy pronouncements
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what the opening statement is
	     
	     MS MYERS  But it's  perhaps later today I'll be able 
to tell you with more certainty  I think that's still under review  
But the overriding purpose of this  it's not a mystery it's not 
meant to be  It's just to take questions
	     
	     Q	  It would be helpful to know whether  what the 
opening statement is on
	     
	     MS MYERS  Since the major purpose here is just to take 
questions it's not completely resolved yet
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee one policy that was expected last week and 
that the White House you and George seemed to indicate we might get 
would be an AIDS czar  Will he announce that today  And what's the 
delay on that
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't think we meant to imply  I think 
we said it would happen soon  I don't think we meant to imply with 
any certainty that it would be this week  It is coming soon  I 
don't anticipate that happening today
	     
	     Q	  What's the delay  Isn't this the perfect time to 
announce an AIDS czar
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't know that it's a delay  I think the 
process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through 
the necessary background checks and to make sure that we've crossed 
the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for 
the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board  And why wasn't her 
appointment announced here
	     
	     MS MYERS  The qualifications  I don't know if 
there's a specific list I'll have to check and see  I think there 
are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds  
Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government 
service  I think there's a broad variety of views across political 
spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there  We never 
made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board 
which is Admiral William Crowe
	     
	     Q	  Why would he appoint her though if the American 
people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government 
job
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe that the American people 
ever had  voted on her  And I certainly  she was never rejected 
in the Senate  She never went up there for a hearing  But the 
President believes she's a very competent person  He's said that  
Zoe Baird  do you understand what the question is  Zoe Baird is on 
the President's Foreign Intelligence 
	     
	     Q	  You said she never went up there for a hearing
	     
	     Q	  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage 
over violating federal laws
	     
	     MS MYERS  Right she never  she was never  but you 
said she was rejected by the Senate  I was just simply trying to 
point out that she was never voted on by the Senate
	     
	     Q	  So you don't think that is any problem
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't think there's any problem
	     
	     Q	  She has been appointed to this board is that a 
fact
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Does she need confirmation for this  Does she need 
confirmation to be a member of the 
	     
	     MS MYERS  No  It's a presidential appointment
	     
	     Q	  Usually announcements are made here at the White 
House  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly
	     
	     MS MYERS  We didn't make an announcement  People who 
asked were told who  the members of the board were  We didn't make 
an official announcement  If anybody's interested in that we can 
certainly put out the list of names
	     
	     Q	  I'd like to know
	     
	     Q	  Don't such board members  don't you normally as a  
matter of  routinely put out releases on all these boards and 
presidential appointment regardless of their dimension
	     
	     MS MYERS  Not always  But again I'm happy to put 
this out
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that the standard practice
	     
	     Q	  That was past practice
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again I'm happy to put it out  We'll put 
out a list of the members of the board today
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee I don't want to try to fail to let you get 
out of this swamp but  laughter  all I really want to know is 
hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such 
announcements to be made routinely
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think generally but not always  And we're 
happy to put that out today
	     
	     Q	  What is the board what is her title what is the 
size of the board
	     
	     MS MYERS  There is roughly a dozen members on the 
board  It is a civilian board although their are some obviously 
retired military personnel on the board that provide input into 
intelligence policy for the President  Again the chairman of that 
board is Admiral William Crowe
	     
	     Q	  And did he recommend Baird
	     
	     Q	  What's the name of the board
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board PFIAB
	     
	     Q	  What's her qualification  that she had employed 
an illegal alien  Is that  laughter  
	     
	     MS MYERS  Do you want an answer to the question or you 
just want to make a joke
	     
	     Q	  Let me phrase it another way  Why shouldn't this 
appointment be viewed as a payback for the difficulty she had a 
couple of months ago
	     
	     MS MYERS  Because it's not  
	     
	     Q	  What's her experience in foreign intelligence
	     
	     MS MYERS  She's an experienced attorney someone who 
the President believes is very competent and qualified  And I think 
part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input  Not 
everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert that 
is not the board's mission  It is to provide civilian input for the 
President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters  He 
believes she's very qualified very competent person enormously 
talented and has said that throughout
	     
	     Q	  Is this just a figment of my overactive 
imagination or was there discussion early on about abolishing the 
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't think so  On December th when he 
announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he 
would  had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board  So I 
don't believe there's ever been any 
	     
	     Q	  Earlier than that during the transition
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I don't believe so  It was announced 
again on December th  Admiral Crowe couldn't be there but it was 
announced 
	     
	     Q	  Are members paid
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't believe so but I'll doublecheck
	     
	     Q	  On another subject on Waco how do you explain the 
discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the 
bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state  I guess it's the 
Texas Ranger reports  
	     
	     MS MYERS  Most of the information is coming  the 
federal information is coming from the site  Clearly there's been 
some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it  
Officials in the Justice Department were told I believe the day 
before yesterday that there were several bodies found with bullet 
holes  I think there's some discrepancy about that and the Justice 
Department is looking into it
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to get involved in trying to 
sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down 
there with some people withdrawing others saying they're in charge 
but others  Justice FBI Texas Rangers  all grabbing a piece of 
this
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't know that he's going to try to 
mediate the dispute  I mean I'll let you know if there's anything 
he intends to do about it  But as you know there are several levels 
of investigation ongoing and we're hopeful that they can work 
together 
	     
	     Q	  Is there any one agency or official down there in 
charge of everything
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't know  I'll have to get back to you 
on that
	     
	     Q	  What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's going to be fairly general  I don't 
think it's going to be any specific announcements  I think it's 
going to be sort of a 
	     
	     Q	  Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about
	     
	     MS MYERS  We're still working on it  But I wouldn't 
look for any announcements of like the drug czar or something like 
that
	     
	     Q	  Is it sort of a  days speech sort of my 
excellent adventure for  days  Laughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  Not exactly but I think he'll take a little 
bit broader look about what's happened in the last 
	     
	     Q	  Foreign domestic
	     
	     MS MYERS  A little bit of both but I think a lot of 
domestic
	     
	     Q	  And overview 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes more of an overview than a specific 
policy announcement  
	     	  
	     Q	  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which 
the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday
	     
	     MS MYERS  It will be a letter read to the crowd by 
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi
	     
	     Q	  Is that available
	     
	     MS MYERS  Not yet but it will be  Sure
	     
	     Q	  Are you going to put it out here or 
	     
	     MS MYERS  We'll probably put it out here on Sunday
	     
	     Q	  Travel next week
	     
	     MS MYERS  Unclear
	     
	     Q	  What was the question
	     
	     Q	  Likely
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't 
	     
	     Q	  Likely  Possible
	     
	     MS MYERS  Possible
	     
	     Q	  What's possible
	     
	     MS MYERS  Travel
	     
	     Q	  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform 
and national service legislative proposals next week  Do you have 
days yet for them
	     
	     MS MYERS  Not yet
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us which order
	     
	     MS MYERS  Campaign finance reform first national 
service later in the week
	     
	     Q	  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     
	     Q	  And any report in the aftermath of the day
	     
	     MS MYERS  Any readout from the day
	     
	     Q	  Readout
	     
	     MS MYERS  It's possible  Jeff Eller will be down 
there  I think he can go through what the President did during the 
day  We don't expect any photo op or anything other than departure 
here in the morning
	     
	     Q	   Dee Dee the President has not made a regular 
practice as some of his predecessors have of going to Camp David  
In fact he's been there  what  once or twice
	     
	     MS MYERS  Twice
	     
	     Q	  Why this weekend
	     
	     MS MYERS  He went two weekends ago as you know on 
the way home from his fatherinlaw's funeral  I think that they 
found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend 
some time together as a family  And this is just an opportunity to 
do the same
	     
	     Q	  There's no march there
	     
	     Q	  It has nothing to do with the march here
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     
	     Q	  Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now 
instead of in Jamestown have you thought about him making a quick 
passby flyover  laughter 
	     
	     MS MYERS  He'll fly straight to Boston
	     
	     Q	  Flying straight did you say  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  George took a question yesterday on Waco  The 
President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a 
minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the 
FBI  And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and 
whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas  Do 
you have an answer on that
	     
	     MS MYERS  I don't  I'll check
	     
	     THE PRESS  Thank you

Today marks the th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and xSoviet
Armenia The following letter which represents a small portion 
of the full text along with more than  pages of historical 
documents scholarly sources eyewitness accounts and photographs 
was sent to President Bill Clinton members of Congress editors 
program directors and columnists of major newspapers journals and 
radioTV stations for the th anniversary of the Armenian genocide 
of  million Muslim people On April  of every year the people 
of Turkiye remember their dead They grieve for lost family and the 
lost homes of their grandfathers This year the Turkish Nation is 
mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their 
lives generously and with altruism so that the future generations 
may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and 
prosperously

 letter 

During the years of World War I the xSoviet Armenian Government 
has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people which 
not only took the lives of  million Muslim people but was also the 
method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants To this day 
Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the xSoviet Armenia In order 
to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland 
which is the crux of Turkish political demands fascist xSoviet Armenia 
continues its antiTurkish policy in the following ways

 xSoviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility

 xSoviet Armenia employing ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish 
Genocide

 xSoviet Armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through
the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests

 Using all its human financial and governmental resources xSoviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonTurkish supporters
of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

Using all the aforementioned methods the xSoviet Armenian Government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue

Yet despite the efforts of the xSoviet Armenian Government and its 
terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks 
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically 
exterminated by the Armenians the international wall of silence on 
this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of 
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition 
of the Turkish Genocide

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide

 that xSoviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide

 that all world governments and especially the United States officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure

 that the US Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally xSoviet Armenia and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands

 that the xSoviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the coldblooded extermination of 
 million Muslim people in their history books

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the th century as a positive step Furthermore a new 
generation has risen  equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically
mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause through
all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the 
armed struggle Therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon
all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in 
the political cultural and religious activities of the th Anniversary
of the Armenian genocide of  million Muslim people

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                             April       

	     
                  PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
	     
	     
                            The East Room 


 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Terry do you have a question
	     
	     Q	  Mr President there's a growing feeling that the 
Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate  
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something 
anything to stop the fighting  Is the United States considering 
taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery 
sites
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well first let me say as you know for 
more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for 
further action  And I want to say too let's look at the last three 
months  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and 
we have tried to move forward first on the nofly zone on 
enforcement of it on the humanitarian airdrops on the war crimes 
investigation on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace 
process  We have made some progress  And now we have a very much 
tougher sanctions resolution  And Leon Fuerth who is the National 
Security Advisor to the Vice President is in Europe now working on 
implementing that  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia
	     
	     And we are reviewing other options  I think we should 
act  We should lead  the United States should lead  We have led 
for the last three months  We have moved the coalition  And to be 
fair our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part  And 
they have troops on the ground there
	     
	     But I do not think we should act alone unilaterally 
nor do I think we will have to  And in the next several days I think 
we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and 
which has taken a lot of my time as well as the time of the 
administration as it should have over the last  days or so  I 
think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a 
policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it
	     
	     Q	  Can I follow up
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Sure
	     
	     Q	  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I think the Holocaust is on a whole 
different level  I think it is without precedent or peer in human 
history  On the other hand ethnic cleansing is the kind of 
inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree  The idea of 
moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely 
because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing  And it is 
especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic 
groups live side by side for so long together  And I think you have 
to stand up against it  I think it's wrong
	     
	     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in 
that region  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and 
the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning and I think we're making 
progress on that front  But what's going on with the Serbians and 
the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other 
conflicts both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of 
the region
	     
	     Q	  Mr President by any count you have not had a 
good week in your presidency  The tragedy in Waco the defeat of 
your stimulus bill the standoff in Bosnia  What did you do wrong 
and what are you going to do differently  How do you look at things  
Are you reassessing  Laughter
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I don't really believe that the 
situation in Bosnia  it's not been a good week for the world but I 
don't know that the administration could have made it different
	     
	     On the stimulus package I'd like to put it into the 
larger context and remind you that in this  days we have already 
fundamentally changed the direction of an American government  We 
have abandoned trickledown economics  We've abandoned the policies 
that brought the debt of this country from  trillion to  trillion 
in only a decade  
	     
	     The budget plan which passed the Congress which will 
reduce the deficit and increase investment has led to a year low 
in mortgage rates dramatically lower interest rates  There are 
probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages 
in the last three months or who have had access to cheaper credit  
That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this 
economy in ways that are very very good for the country  And so we 
are moving in the right direction economically
	     
	     I regret that the stimulus did not pass and I have 
begun to ask  and will continue to ask not only people in the 
administration but people in the Congress whether there is something 
I could have done differently to pass that  Part of the reason it 
didn't pass was politics part of it was a difference in ideas  
There are really people still who believe that it's not needed  I 
just disagree with that  
	     
	     I think the recovery  the economists say it's been 
underway for about two years and we've still had  months of seven
percent unemployment and all the wealthy countries are having 
trouble creating jobs  So I think there was an idea base  an 
argument there that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates 
and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years 
to take effect this sort of supplemental appropriation should go 
forward
	     
	     Now I have to tell you I did misgauge that because a 
majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted 
for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in  and 
voted  times for regular supplemental appropriations like this  I 
just misgauged it  And I hope that I can learn something  I've just 
been here  days  And you know I was a Governor working with a 
contentious legislature for  years and it took me a decade to get 
political reform there  So it takes time  to change things  But I 
basically feel very good about what's happened in the first  days 
with regard to the Congress
	     
	     Q	  Waco 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well with regard to Waco I don't have 
much to add to what I've already said  I think it is a  I want the 
situation looked into  I want us to bring in people who have any 
insights to bear on that  I think it's very important that the whole 
thing be thoroughly gone over  But I still maintain what I said from 
the beginning that the offender there was David Koresh  And I do 
not think the United States government is responsible for the fact 
that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves  And I'm sorry 
that they killed their children
	     
	     Q	  Mr President to follow up partly on Helen on your 
stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill Ross 
Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people 
in your tax policy  He was strongly critical of your stimulus 
package  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign 
against the North American Free Trade Agreement  How are you going 
to handle his political criticism  Will it complicate your efforts 
on the Hill with your economic plan  And do you plan to repackage 
some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to 
resubmit them to the Hill
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Let me answer that question first  
We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days  I'm going 
to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can 
do about that  With regard to the economic plan I must say I found 
that rather amazing  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr 
Perot  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are but I 
would  go back and read his book and his plan  There's a 
remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts 
we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy  
But otherwise the plans are remarkably similar  
	     
	     So I think it would be  I'll be interested to see if 
maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and 
he has some new ideas to bring to bear  I'll be glad to hear them
	     
	     Q	  To follow up sir how do you plan to handle his 
political criticism  He's launched a campaign against you  Do you 
think you can sit back and just 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well first of all I will ask you to 
apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me  And if he's 
changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last 
year then we need to know why and what his ideas are  Maybe he's 
got some constructive ideas  
	     
	     I think the American people have shown that they're very 
impatient with people who don't want to produce results  And the one 
thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last  
even if they don't agree with what I do  is that I want to get 
something done  I just came here to try to change things  I want to 
do things  And I want to do things that help people's lives  So my 
judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good that is 
constructive that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will 
change people's lives for the better fine  But I think that that 
ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this 
debate and not just to the President

	     Q	  Mr President to go back to Bosnia for a minute  
You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action a 
criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many 
options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of 
paralysis  The United States is the last remaining superpower  Why 
is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act 
unilaterally

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well the United States  surely you 
would agree that the United States even as the last remaining 
superpower has to act consistent with international law under some 
mandate of the United Nations

	     Q	  But you have a mandate and 

	     THE PRESIDENT  They do and that is one of the things 
that we have under review  I haven't ruled out any option for 
action  I would remind all of you I have not ruled out any option 
except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the 
introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there  
We are not  

	     So we are reviewing other options  But I also would 
remind you that to be fair our allies have had  the French the 
British and the Canadians  have had troops on the ground there  
They have been justifiably worried about those  But they have 
supported the airdrops the toughening of the sanctions  They 
welcomed the American delegation now in Europe working on how to 
make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia  And 
I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely 
reassessing their position and I would not rule out the fact that we 
can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where 
we have been  I don't have any criticism of the British the French 
and others about that
	     
	     Q	  Would that be military action
	     
	     Q	  Mr President several of the leading lights in 
your administration ranging from your FBI Director to your UN 
Ambassador to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services 
Secretary have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which 
are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in 
your administration  Why is that  Are you losing your political 
grip
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Give me an example 
	     
	     Q	  Example  Judge Sessions said that there was no 
child abuse in Waco  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's 
newspapers at least that she favors air strikes in Bosnia  All of 
these are things you said that you didn't support
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  First of all I don't know what  we 
know that David Koresh had sex with children  I think that is 
undisputed is it not  Is it not  Does anybody dispute that  Where 
I come from that qualifies as child abuse  And we know that he had 
people teaching these kids how to kill themselves  I think that 
qualifies as abuse  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I 
don't know exactly what he said
	     
	     In terms of Madeleine Albright Madeleine Albright has 
made no public statement at all about air strikes  There is a press 
report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed 
her  or memo  in which she expressed her views about the new 
direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior 
members of my administration to let me know what they thought we 
ought to do next  And I have heard from her and from others about 
what they think we ought to do next  And I'm not going to discuss 
the recommendations they made to me but in the next few days when I 
make a decision about what to do then I will announce what I'm going 
to do  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies 
speaking out of school
	     
	     Q	  How about the Value Added Tax Mr President
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  What was that
	     
	     Q	  The Value Added Tax  Mrs Rivlin and Miss Shalala 
both said that they thought that that was a good idea
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I don't mind them saying they think it's 
a good idea  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy 
grounds  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it 
in the health care debate  No decision has been made on that  And I 
have no objection to their expressing their views on that  We've had 
a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they 
thought that tax would help make their particular industries more 
competitive in the global economy  I took no  that wasn't taking a 
line against an administration policy
	     
	     Q	  Mr President a week ago a group of gay and 
lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed 
in the most ringing terms their confidence in your understanding of 
them and their political aspirations and their belief that you would 
fulfill those aspirations  Do you feel now that you will be able to 
meet their now enhanced expectations
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I don't know about that  And I 
don't know what their  it depends on what the expectations are  
But I'll tell you this  I believe that this country's policies 
should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination  I believe 
when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country 
that other people can do there ought to be an overwhelming and 
compelling reason for it  I believe we need the services of all of 
our people and I have said that consistently  And not as a 
political proposition  The first time this issue came up was in  
when I was in Boston  I was just asked the question about it
	     
	     And I might add  it's interesting that I have been 
attacked  obviously those who disagree with me here are primarily 
coming from the political right in America  When I was Governor I 
was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights 
of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to 
practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards  I just have 
always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect 
the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest 
of their capacities and I'm going to stick right with that
	     
	     Q	  Are you concerned sir that you may have generated 
expectations on their end and criticism among others that has 
hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis 
on this issue
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Yes but I have not placed a great deal 
of emphasis on it  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters 
and in the press  I've just simply taken my position and tried to 
see it through  And that's what I do  It doesn't take a lot of my 
time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do 
and that's what I'll continue to do
	     
	     Q	  Mr President getting back to the situation in 
Bosnia  and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on 
new options previously considered unacceptable  But the two most 
commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable 
the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited 
air strikes perhaps to cut off supply lines  Without telling us 
your decision  presumably you haven't made any final decisions on 
those two options  what are the pros and cons that are going 
through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final 
decision  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I'm reluctant to get into this  There 
are  those are two of the options  There are some other options 
that have been considered  All have pluses and minuses all have 
supporters and opponents within the administration and in the 
Congress where I would remind you heavy consultations will be 
required to embark on any new policy
	     
	     I do believe that on the air strike issue the 
pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military 
action apply there  If you take action if the United States takes 
action we must have a clearlydefined objective that can be met  We 
must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear  The 
United States is not should not become involved as a partisan in a 
war  
	     
	     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo the 
question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to 
fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace  Will 
it lead to more bloodshed  What kind of reaction can others have 
that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy
	     
	     But I think both of them deserve some serious 
consideration along with some other options we have
	     
	     Q	  Do you think that these people who are trying to 
get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't 
taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and 
we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from 
Vietnam   And now many of them are coming up with bills for 
treatment of Agent Orange  How can we afford to go to any more of 
these wars
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I think that's a good argument 
against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent 
in a war there  But we are after all the world's only super power  
We do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of 
systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia which could 
have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences  and 
goodness knows there have been many  but also could have other 
practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts 
of ethnic tensions exist

	     Q	  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris 
Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive 
action against the Serbs until after Sunday  And in general how has 
his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia

	     THE PRESIDENT  No I have not made any agreement and 
he did not ask for that  We never even discussed that interestingly 
enough  The Russians I would remind you in the middle of President 
Yeltsin's campaign abstained from our attempt to get tougher 
sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper 
decision for them and one that the United States and I'm sure the 
rest of the free world very much appreciated 

	     Q	  Do you wish Mr President that you'd become more 
involved in the planning of the Waco operation  And how would you 
handle that situation differently now

	     THE PRESIDENT  I don't think as a practical matter that 
the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds 
of things at that detail  One of the things that I'm sure will come 
out when we look into this is  the questions will be asked and 
answered did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions 
we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten  And 
I look forward to that  But at the time I have to say as I did 
before the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed once 
we knew that the FBI was going to go in was to ask that the military 
be consulted because of the quasi as least military nature of the 
conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and 
their obvious willingness to use them  And then on the day before 
the action I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I 
have reported to you previously and which at the time I thought were 
sufficient  I have  as I said I'm sure  I leave it to others to 
make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should 
have asked
	     
	     Q	  Mr President what is your assessment of Director 
Sessions' role in the Waco affair  And have you made a decision on 
his future  And if you haven't will you give him a personal hearing 
before you do decide
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well first of all I have no assessment 
of his role since I had no direct contact with him  And I mean no 
negative or positive inference  I have no assessment there  I stand 
by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI  And 
I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what 
to do with the direction of the FBI
	     
	     Q	  Mr President since you said that one side in 
Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to 
the nth degree why do you then tell us that the United States cannot 
take a partisan view in this war
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I said that the principle of 
ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against  That 
does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter 
a war in effect to redraw the lines geographical lines of 
republics within what was Yugoslavia or that that would ultimately 
be successful
	     
	     I think what the United States has to do is to try to 
figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the 
people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop 
ethnic cleansing  And that is obviously the difficulty we are 
wrestling with  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy 
problem we face and that all of our allies face  And if it were 
easy I suppose it would have been solved before  We have tried to 
do more in the last  days than was previously done  It has clearly 
not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression and  we are now 
looking at what else we can do
	     
	     Q	  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt 
administration for not having bombed the railroads to the 
concentration camps and things that were near military targets  
Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict direct 
conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  There may be  I would remind you that 
the circumstances were somewhat different  We were then at war with 
Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so 
series of incidents  so perplexing  But we have  as I say we've 
got all of our options under review
	     
	     Q	  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge 
of collapse  What can you do to salvage it short of a fullscale 
military operation
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well you may know something I don't  
That's not what our people tell me  I think Mr Caputo and 
Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job  The thing keeps 
going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the 
de facto government there  It's obvious what their concerns are  
They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the 
first place and President Aristide we feel should be restored to 
power  We're working toward that  I get a report on that  we 
discuss it at least three times a week and I'm convinced that we're 
going to prevail there and be successful  
	     
	     I do believe that there's every reason to think that 
there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to 
guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on 
both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of 
ongoing civilized society  But I believe we're going to prevail 
there
	     
	     Q	  Mr President would you care to make your 
assessment of the first  days before we make one for you  
Laughter
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I'll say if  I believe first of 
all we passed the budget resolution in record time  That was the 
biggest issue  That confirmed the direction of the administration 
and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both 
bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do 
it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes almost all of 
which come from the highest income people in this society reversing 
a year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the 
middle class whose incomes were going down when their taxes were 
going up while the deficit went from  trillion to  trillion the 
total national debt and the deficit continued to go up
	     
	     We have a year low in interest rates from mortgages 
We have lower interest rates across the board  We have tens of 
billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people 
refinance their debt  
	     
	     We have established a new environmental policy which is 
dramatically different  The Secretary of Education has worked with 
me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach 
in education that focuses on tough standards as well as increasing 
opportunity  We have done an enormous amount of work on political 
reform on campaign finance and lobbying reform  And I have imposed 
tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials  
These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the 
campaign but with turning the country around  The Vice President is 
heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal 
government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens 
of this country  
	     
	     We are working on a whole range of other things  The 
welfare reform initiative to move people from welfare to work  And 
of course a massive amount of work has been done on the health care 
issue which is a huge economic and personal security problem for 
millions of Americans  
	     
	     So I think it is amazing how much has been done  More 
will be done  We also passed the Family Leave bill  A version of 
the motor voter bill  that has not come out of conference back to 
me yet  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program  
So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction  
I feel good about it
	     
	     Q	  Sir a followup  Wouldn't you say though that 
one of your biggest initiatives aid to Soviet Russia is now 
practically finished  if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own 
country how can we do it for them
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Let me recast the question a little bit  
It's a good question  laughter  it's a good question but to be 
fair we've got to recast it  We have already  the first round of 
aid to the Soviet  to nonSoviet Russia to a democratic Russia is 
plainly going to go through the first  billion  The aid that we 
agreed with our partners in the G to provide through the 
international financial institutions which is a big dollar item is 
plainly going to go through  The question is can we get any more 
aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States 
Congress  And that is a question I think Mary that will be 
resolved in the weeks ahead in part by what happens to the American 
workers and their jobs and their future  I think the two things will 
be tied by many members of Congress

	     Q	  The tailhook report came out this morning 
documenting horrendous and nearlycriminal conduct on the part of the 
Navy  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done 
about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy

	     THE PRESIDENT  First let me comment a little on that  
The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and 
which has no place in the armed services  And I expect the report to 
be acted on in the appropriate way  I also want to say to the 
American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for 
what it is a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to 
be thoroughly examined  It should not be taken as a general 
indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who 
serve there  It is very specific in its allegations and it will be 
pursued  

	     The only thing I said to the SecretaryDesignate of the 
Navy and the only thing I should have said to him I think is that I 
expected him to take the report and to do his duty  And I believe he 
will do that

	     Q	  Mr President to back to Russia for just a minute  
The latest poll show that Mr Yeltsin will probably win his vote of 
confidence  But there seems to be a real tossup on whether or not 
voters are going to endorse his economic reforms  

	     THE PRESIDENT  I understand that  

	     Q	  Can you live with a split  laughter  can you 
live with a split decision though or do you need both passed in 
order to then build support for Russian aid

	     THE PRESIDENT  I believe  the answer to your question 
is for the United States the key question should be that which is 
posed to any democracy which is who wins the election  If he wins 
the election if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as 
their President then I think we should do our best to work with him 
toward reform
	     
	     You know we had a lot of other countries here for the 
Holocaust Museum dedication  their leaders were here  Leaders from 
Eastern Europe leaders from at least one republic of the former 
Soviet Union all of them having terrible economic challenges as they 
convert from a communist command and control economy to a market 
economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere  And 
in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty all 
leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll 
because they haven't produced the results that the people so 
earnestly yearn for  You can understand that  
	     
	     But if they have confidence in the leadership I think 
that's all we can ask  And the United States will  if the Russian 
people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the 
United States will continue to work with him  I think he is a 
genuine democrat  small d  and genuinely committed to reform  I 
think that we should support that

	     Q	  Mr President Mr Perot has come out strongly in 
what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement 
NAFTA  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement 
and when do you expect to see it accomplished
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I think we'll have the agreement ready 
in the fairly near future  You know our people are still working 
with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side 
agreements  We're trying to work out what the environmental 
agreement will say what the labor agreement will say and then what 
the fairest way to deal with enforcement is  
	     
	     The Mexicans say and there is some merit to their 
position that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty 
in enforcement to a multilateral commission  Even in the United 
States to be fair we have some folks who are worried about that 
about giving that up  On the other hand if we're going to have an 
environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means 
something then there has to be ultimately some consequences for 
violating them  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an 
approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations 
if you keep on violating it past a certain point  maybe not an 
isolated incident but a pattern of violation  there is going to be 
some enforcement  There must be consequences  And we're working out 
the details of that
	     
	     But I still feel quite good about it  And this is just 
an area where I disagree with Mr Perot and with others  I think 
that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more 
closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us 
from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America and 
gives us a bigger world in which to trade  I think that's the only 
way a rich country can grow richer  If you look at what Japan and 
other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own 
region it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry 
about how to build those bridges in our own area  
	     
	     So this is an idea battle  You know you've got a lot 
of questions and I want to answer them all but let me say not every 
one of these things can be distilled simply into politics  you 
know who's for this and who's for that and if this person is for 
this somebody else has got to be for that  A lot of these things 
honestly involved real debates over ideas over who's right and wrong 
about the world toward which we're moving  And the answers are not 
selfevident  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for 
President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating 
these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way  
So I just have a difference of opinion  I believe that the concept 
of NAFTA is sound even though as you know I thought that the 
details needed to be improved
	     
	     Q	  Mr President there was a tremendous flurry of 
interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to 
show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners  General 
Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was 
authentic he believes that it was incorrect  Do you have a personal 
view at this point about that issue  And more broadly do you 
believe that in fact the Vietnamese did return all the American 
prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  First let me say I saw General Vessey 
before he went to Vietnam and after he returned  And I have a high 
regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country 
in this way  As to whether the document had any basis in fact let 
me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it 
had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to 
undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim
	     
	     I do not know whether that is right or wrong  We are 
having it basically evaluated at this time and when we complete the 
evaluation we'll tell you  And of course we want to tell the 
families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs  I 
think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of 
the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last 
interchange but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know 
all that we need to know  There are still some cases that we don't 
know the answer to  But I do believe we're making some progress  I 
was encouraged by the last trip
	     
	     Q	  I'd like to follow up on that  Before the US 
normalizes relations allows trade to go forward do you have to be 
personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be 
willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to 
resolve these cases the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to 
us to confirm good faith
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  A lot of experts say you can never 
resolve every case every one that we couldn't resolve all the cases 
for them and that there are still some cases that have not been 
factually resolved going back to the Second World War  But what I 
would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward 
resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time 
and that there was a complete open and unrestricted commitment to 
continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving 
those cases  And we're not there yet  
	     
	     Again I have to be guided a little bit by people who 
know a lot about this  And I confess to being much more heavily 
influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there 
or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and 
the other things which seem so compelling in this moment  I just am 
very influenced by how the families feel
	     
	     Q	     your economic stimulus package are you doing 
some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans 
your legislative plans for the coming year including the crime bill 
the health care initiative and other things  Are there any plans to 
do that  And also did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob 
Dole
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  No what I underestimated was the extent 
to which what I thought was a fairly selfevident case particularly 
after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress 
including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year  when 
we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over  
billion in deficit reduction  When they had voted repeatedly for 
supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments I thought at 
least four of them would vote to break cloture and I underestimated 
that  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that  
	     
	     I also thought that if I made a goodfaith effort to 
negotiate and to compromise that it would not be rebuffed  Instead 
every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had 
previously been talking to the Majority Leader about  So it was a 
strange set of events  But I think what happened was what was a 
significant part of our plan but not the major part of it acquired 
a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits so 
that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately Mr 
President I'd like to be for this but I can't now  And we're all 
strung out and we're divided  
	     
	     And I think we need to do a reality check  As I said 
what I want to know  let me go back to what I said  what I want 
to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on  and 
Republicans or Democrats  is what could I have done differently to 
make it come out differently  Because the real losers here were not 
the President and the administration  The real losers were the 
hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now  We could 
have put another  kids to work this summer  I mean we could 
have done a lot of good things with that money  And I think that is 
very very sad  And it became more political than it should have  
But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water 
that it was deficit spending  That just won't wash
	     
	     Q	     and redo 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  No  I mean you know for example you 
mentioned the crime bill  I think it would be a real mistake not to 
pass the crime bill  I mean the crime bill was almost on the point 
of passage last year  And they were all fighting over the Brady 
Bill  Surely surely after what we have been through in this country 
just in the last three months with the kind of mindless violence we 
have seen we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a 
waiting period before they buy a handgun  And surely we can see that 
we need more police officers on the street  
	     
	     That's another thing that  I really believe that once 
we move some of that money  not all but some of it up into this 
jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the 
street who'd been laid off that would be a compelling case  I mean 
people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward 
I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill
	     
	     Q	  Mr President back to the tailhook report for a 
second  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's 
senior leadership in general but did not name any of the senior 
officers  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated 
in this including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las 
Vegas should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a 
right to know the names of the senior officers
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  You should know that under the rules of 
law which apply to this I am in the chain of command  There is now 
an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course  If I 
were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which 
might be later made in this case  I don't really think  I think 
all I can tell you is what I have already said  I was very disturbed 
by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report and I 
want appropriate action to be taken  
	     
	     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and 
appropriate action is taken I have been advised that because I am 
the CommanderinChief I have to be very careful about what I say so 
as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action 
might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or 
con  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing 
handled in an appropriate and thorough way
	     
	     Q	  Mr President could I ask you for a clarification 
on Bosnia  You said that you were not considering introduction of 
American forces  Does that include any air forces as well as ground 
forces sir
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I said ground forces
	     
	     Q	  You said ground forces  Could I ask you sir if 
you fear that using US air strikes might  draw the United States 
into a ground war there
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I just don't want to discuss our 
evaluation of the options anymore  I've told you that there's never 
been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of 
ground forces into an ongoing conflict there
	     
	     Q	  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington 
this weekend for the march did you ever reconsider your decision to 
leave town for this weekend  Did you ever consider in any way 
participating in some of the activities 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  No
	     
	     Q	  Why not
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Because I  and basically I wouldn't 
participate in other marches  I think once you become President on 
balance except under unusual circumstances that is not what should 
be done  But more importantly I'm going to the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors a trip that presumably most of you would want me 
to make to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental 
issues at stake for our country right now  And I expect that I will 
say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here 
asking for a climate that is free of discrimination asking 
basically to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be 
treated like other American citizens if they do that and just that  
And that's always been my position  not only for the gays who will 
be here but for others as well  
	     
	     Thank you very much

                                 END PM EDT

This is a gaysympathetic person who notices things like this  I

   For your information Islam permits freedom of religion  there is

Steve

Actually Islam postulates that the Jews have deliberately falsified the
written Bible for nefarious purposes and thus the Jewish claim to the
Land of Israel is nullified  That does not leave much room for Jews
to manuever whether they live as dhimmis in Dar alIslam or as enemies

      Here's a hypothetical question  If Clayton said something like all
 those niggers are really stupid  Please don't be offended I'm not racist
 but merely using an example of Clayton's malign logic  And then said he
 read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school I
 bet he wouldn't have your support  Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are
 dishonest evil lying child molesters without PERSONALLY having a single
 homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him

      God created a place for bigots  It's called Hell and Clayton is going
 to burn there for a long time  I pray for him to find in his heart the
 Christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers
 and sisters because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never
 be righteous

There is a difference between supporting Claytons opinions and supporting
his right to speak  I want you to know that you cannot educate andor
elevate ones understanding by calling him names  Clayton has an opinion
which in his mind is as valid as any opinion anyone else on the net has
If you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner
city and began the conversation with Those niggers in th  You
would lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your
second word  All name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the
audience you are trying to address  Clayton is guilty of that and as
such has distracted attention away from his message to bits and pieces
of his conversation  I don't understand why people want to repeat his
mistakes

	Argument that he is not an illiterate about healthcare plans

In anycase fundamentalist Christians make up about  of the

 of the population  That is a VERY LARGE market share of the
health care business far too large to ignor or run roughshod
over simply questionable ideology

	However a sizable fraction of these are willing to get
abortions One study found that at some places at least  of the
women professed to be Born Again Furthermore a large fraction of
Catholics use artificial birth control methods frowned on by the
Church So this abortionrejecting healthcare market might be much
smaller than one would think

	But never underestimate the willingness of some professed
opponents of abortion to get them

	If you are against abortion DON'T HAVE ONE

	goes one prochoice slogan I once saw on someone's car or was
it a pickup truck I had been following an old railroad line that is
to be used for a BART extension in South San Francisco and I saw this
car with this bumper sticker along the way

As for someone suggesting that no one would be upset if I were
to give money to support women with crisis pregnancies etc  But
I have having initiated and supported an ad in USC's student
newspaper regarding a Catholic health clinic offering assistance
to women in crisis pregnancies  I've also devoted my life to a
consistent life ethic  I've been arrested as part of this not
at Operation Rescue protests though I do have friends who have
participated in them and may at some point participate in them
too but at protests sponsored by Pax Christi regarding nuclear
weapons manufacture both at the Nevada Test Site and the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory  What have you done folks

	Operation Rescue Dennis Kriz be aware of some of the company
you keep I'm talking about seriously militaristic rightwingers who
would love to execute those who provide and get abortions Although there has
been only one such assassination so far I wonder how many other
opponents of abortion would be willing to perform such assassinations
if they could get away with it

Thirdly it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given
the benefit of hindsight  something that those who made the
decisions did not have the benefit of  Why not give them the courtesy
of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the
data they had  in a very very difficult situation

  What is your proof that they did the best they could   Unless
  they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger
  then the best they could have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT

  Some of us DID predict this outcome or at least suggested a
  strong possibility of it  I for one said that in the event of
  an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger

  out then and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net 
  who disagreed with me an adult may freely choose suicide but they
  have no right to impose this choice on their children

  Now while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I 
  have to say on this I DO expect them to figure it out on their
  own or to take the advice of experts  The cult specialist inter
  viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly stonewalled
  by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational
  tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so 
  increased the chance of a tragic outcome

Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were
done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound  give
me a break

  Give US a break   Pumping teargas for  minutes into a compound 
  filled with CHILDREN   This doesn't seem to show much regard for 
  their lives or safety   Nontoxic teargas is an oxymoron  Children
  have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions
  induced by teargas moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone
  subject to laryngospasms asthma or heart disease

  If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage someone who provokes the 
  madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the
  death of the hostage as the madman himself  These kinds of situations
  have to be handled delicately  not by surrounding a place with
  tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud
  speakers at all hours   That approach is idiotic  


Be part of the solution  not the problem

  The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the the authorities
  The Feds showed themselves here as they have so many times in the
  past to be a gang of triggerhappy impulsive yahoos who cause more
  trouble than they prevent    Their confrontational approach reinforced
  every single message Koresh was giving his followers virtually guarantee
  ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed
  willingly   This was pointed out here on Compuserve in the press
  just about every place except in the Justice Department where it seems
  a nih philosophy prevails

 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  On February the th four federal 
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law 
against the Branch Davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled 
weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk  
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective a day 
standoff ensued  
	     
	     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every 
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without 
bloodshed and further loss of life  The Bureau's efforts were 
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were 
dealing David Koresh was dangerous irrational and probably 
insane      


The Stacy KoonLawrence Powell defense  The decisions of Janet
Reno and Bill Clinton in this affair are essentially the moral
equivalents of Stacy Koon's  Reno and Clinton have the advantage
in that they investigate themselves

 The Selective Service Registration should be abolished  To start with the
 draft is immoral  Whether you agree with that or not we don't have one now
 and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
 with a volunteer army than with draftees  Finally the government has us
 on many lists in many computers the IRS Social Security Admistration and
 Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to
 Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
 Let's axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit

	More gridlock talk from another relic of the past  The
Selective Service system creates jobs and is an investment in 
the future of americaand whats wrong with that

  Do we want to 'create jobs' or do we want jobs created that are productive
  in our supplydemand economy If your answer is the former then we can
  just round up all jobless people and pay them to build sandcastles in
  the desert If you answer the latter then I fail to see how another
  bureaucracy produces anything

	We need jobs because at this point in the recovery the economy
should have generated  billion jobs and since it has not the
government has to step in and help  Shutting down selective service
would cost good jobs and we can't do that  

	What we really need is to involve selective service in a more
closely directed manner  We need the selective service involved
in environmental protection highspeed rail commuter aircraft 
civil rights national service and health care  Every dollar
we put into selective service now will get us  less spending
in future

	I really believe now to think about it that selective service
is longpast due for the creation of a cabinet position


	Your not beyond hope just get back on america's side and
start doing your part for change  What Bill needs from you
now is support for the economic stimulus and health care reform
You need to devote all your energies to fighting gridlock and
supporting change  Get on the team  After all the evil has
been banished from washington and the time for complaint 
is past being neccessary

	And remember Bill Clinton cares  He may someday even have
a town meeting in your city  If your an appropriate sort of 
person if you phrase your questions properly and show the
proper respect and awe you might have the chance to ask Mr
President your question in person


  Oh i get it This is sarcastic right

Homosexuals lie about the  number to hide the disproportionate
involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  They also lie
about  to keep politicians scared

 You haven't shown any disproportionate involvement

 The Janus Report which came out recently gives  as the percentage
of exclusively or predominantly gay men

  I thumbed through the Janus Report in a bookstore recently looking
  for a clue about their methodology   They were very unclear about
  it but as far as I could tell they relied on their professional
  associates in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subjects
  interviews and numbers    If so this would hardly represent an
  average crosssection    I posted to Usenet at the time asking for
  more data about their methodology but answer came there none  I
  must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information
  on Usenet


 No one is presumably going to say they're gay if they're not But
some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys Thus
the  is a lower limit

  This is the problem  People have to have a lot of confidence in 
  the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak 
  freely about stuff like that    But I agree that if someone's 
  going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming
  to be straight rather than the other way around


I still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage
between  and 

  I don't see why there's any more evidence for this figure than any
  other    It seems totally arbitrary

I completely agree with you  The illegal invasion of Panama was
something Mr Bush never did have to answer for  Remember not
only did a lot of Panamanian civilians get killed but more than
a few American soldiers died too  All this for arresting a petty
dictator  Here's the icing on the cake  to my knowledge the flow
of drugs from Panama hasn't slowed down at all with the removal of
Noriega  So what good did it do to remove him from power  The
cigarette cops and the FBI killing the Branch Davidians in Waco is
equally reprehensible

BTW I've crossposted this article to tpd because I want to
hear from knowledgable people on whether or not the arrest of
Noriega affected the drug trade in any way

The arrest of Noriega did not have any major adverse effect on the
drug trade going through Panama Money laundering continues to be
Panama's main industry In fact it is bigger now than before Noriega
was arrested  Panama's current administration also has ties with
the Colombian cocaine cartels  And large amounts cocaine still
flow through Panama on a regular basis 

Oh well

I've come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about
our system  If much or some of it were true you'd have to take
us for idiots for tolerating it  And given that our insurance was
installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory
governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still
chafing they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
things  think about it  After all we are using the US as a
metric to make comparison  both for keepingupwiththeJoneses
as for confirming that we did something right

True but remember that most of the Canadianbashing exists because American
proponents of your system make it look like it walks on water Even you don't
go that far

Sorry but I'd have to differ  The Canadianbashing wrt to the health 
insurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting  Having
kept up with this debate on the net for some months just about all the
criticism of the Canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even
the antiCanadian propaganda put out by the American insurance industry
and the AMA  

In a few cases such as Mr Case the critiques are wellreasoned and
worthy of response  Most others are misinformed illogical
or just plain dumb  I don't think the same can be said of the American
proponents of the Canadian system much less of the Canadian proponents

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                                  April  


                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS

	     
                          The Briefing Room


 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As you know the President is going 
to come out at  pm  With your indulgence I think what we'd 
like to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award 
first and then have the teacher leave or whatever and then he'll 
make a statement on Waco and take a couple questions  So if we can 
just hold off going live and all that until that's done it probably 
will work out a lot better 
	     
	     Q	  If you'll give us the time  That's the problem
	     
	     Q	  We've got a twominute warning problem
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes it is a problem  It's about 
 pm
	     
	     Q	  The teacher would walk off and then 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that's  I'm just trying 
to work this out here  I think that's the best way to handle it
	     
	     Q	  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way 
the President handled the notifications yesterday 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sure
	     
	     Q	  Did you for instance talk to the Justice 
Department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in 
Waco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Why don't we just take a step even 
farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on 
the contact between the Justice Department and the White House  As 
you know and as we've said the President spoke with the Attorney 
General on Sunday Sunday afternoon  They had a good discussion 
about  minutes  The Attorney General informed the President of 
what she wanted to do  He raised no objections  Obviously she had 
the implicit authority from the President to go forward  He raised 
no objections  She went forward  They had a discussion of a general 
nature about the incident
	     
	     Again yesterday morning around  am the 
President spoke with the Attorney General again  They had a brief 
discussion over what was happening in Waco  As you know this was 
before the fire broke out at the compound  And I think that was why 
there was some  just some confusion  I think that she was 
confusing in her minds before and after the fire not the actual day 
when they spoke  
	     
	     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of 
different levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the 
Justice Department and the White House  They were informing us of 

their decisions what they would like to do  There was an FBI 
briefing in Waco  The Attorney General had her press conference  
The President then issued a statement after that
	     
	     Frankly yesterday afternoon you know there was a fair 
amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in 
Waco and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the 
President say anything until we had a much better sense of what was 
actually happening on the ground  Once we were fairly clear on what 
was happening on the ground in Waco the President issued a 
statement  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday 
evening
	     
	     Q	  At what hour was that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It was quite late  I believe it 
was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum  He took a tour of 
the Holocaust Museum last night
	     
	     Q	  And he went out to dinner
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe briefly  Yes he went to 
dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night  I 
don't know the exact time I think it was relatively late  And he 
just said I think as Dee Dee has reported that he just wanted to 
tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well 
that she did a good job in a tough situation and that she should try 
and get some sleep  He then again spoke with her this morning 
about the followup in Waco and about what they're going to do this 
afternoon  As you know the President will have an announcement to 
make at 
	     
	     Q	  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday last 
night or this morning
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not to my knowledge no
	     
	     Q	  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Webb Hubbell is the general White 
House Liaison and several people talked to Webb  The Attorney 
General was running the operation
	     
	     Q	  Did he tell her that she should sleep well that 
she had done a good job  Or he just tell her that she should get 
some sleep
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think sleep well  done a good 
job  I don't know the exact words  I think that sounds right
	     
	     Q	  I mean sleep well has implications as to 
conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I mean I think everybody 
feels badly when you have a situation when 
	     
	     Q	  I understand that but whether the issue of blame 
is brought up in that phraseology
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that's the spirit  no it 
has nothing to do with that  The spirit with which it was offered 
was that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General 
had to face a very difficult decision a very difficult situation 
yesterday  And that he thought that she had handled it well as best 
as she could and 
	     
	     Q	  Well does he think it was mishandled

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   it was just speaking of warm 
words to a friend
	     
	     Q	  Does he think the situation was mishandled
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President 
	     
	     Q	  In retrospect
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President stands  by the 
decisions of the law enforcement agencies the decisions of the 
Attorney General  He accepts full responsibility  At the same time 
I think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what 
exactly happened do a full review and make sure we do what we can 
to make sure this doesn't happen  this kind of thing doesn't happen 
again or at least we know how to handle it
	     
	     Q	  How much did he know about what she was going to go 
ahead with  I know that she made the case to him  explained 
outlined the case for action  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely 
what action
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't think it was specific 
operational detail as to what was going to happen  I think that they 
had a general discussion about the action about the advisability of 
action  I think as she noted he asked a few general questions just 
trying to get a sense of how things were considered  But it wasn't 
minutebyminute detail of how the operation 
	     
	     Q	  Well was it we are going in  Is it we're 
going to use tear gas  I mean what
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe it was that we want to go 
in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in 
the compound and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement 
out
	     
	     Q	  George was there ever a conscious political 
decision made or even a discussion about distancing the President 
from 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not at all  I mean we were in 
close contact with the Justice Department  The President accepts 
responsibility for this  At the same time  I mean we just wanted 
to be very very clear about how this happened and be as factual as 
we could be on how the decisions were made  It is the responsibility 
of those on the ground to make recommendations  The Attorney General 
has operational control over this  The President obviously accepts 
responsibility for all of this and he stands by the Attorney 
General
	     
	     Q	  George there was a report on the television today 
 and I don't know more than that  one of the members of the cult 
had said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire 
and not themselves  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of 
a smashing into the building  where the fire broke out  And my 
question is is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  All the evidence we have is that 
this fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound 
 every bit of evidence we have
	     
	     Q	  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do 
this now why this particular date and did he ask about possible 
consequences of either death or injury

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know the specific 
questions  He had general questions about how the decision was going 
about being made
	     
	     Q	  Those are general questions and did he ask 
generally why now
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think he asked have you 
considered all of the consequences have you considered the 
recommendations  I don't know if he asked the question why now    
I don't know if he asked that specific question
	     
	     Q	  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff 
that's come out since then about the information provided by the 
listening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I'm not certain how much 
specific detail they got into  I know that she generally said that 
this is the recommendation she's prepared to make I mean the 
decision she's prepared to make  It's based on the recommendations 
she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of 
those involved  Again I do not know how precisely detailed it was 
beyond that
	     
	     Q	  What is the President's understanding why 
yesterday  One of the people who went into the compound a couple 
weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may 
have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this 
action  Why yesterday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  This is the first I've heard  I 
think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has 
said  There were indications that those inside the compound were at 
some danger  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and 
it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that 
the situation was not going to get any better at all  
	     
	     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of 
the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that 
these teams normally have to work  And as the Attorney General has 
said there was some concern over the fact that they did not have 
replacements in place who could stand in for them and there was a 
concern over the safety  
	     
	     All of these factors came into play  They also 
considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts 
on David Koresh and those in the compound  I would just go back to 
what the Attorney General has said  You have to make the best 
judgment you can given the information you have at the time  They 
did  Obviously we all regret the loss of life  It's a terribly 
unfortunate situation  We all wish it could have turned out 
differently but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were 
made at the time
	     
	     Q	  George when did the President know that they were 
going to use tear gas  Was it before the assault on the compound
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I just don't know  I don't believe 
he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go  
I just don't know
	     
	     Q	  Along that point George can you say whether the 
plan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way 
to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday
	     

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think it was presented as a way 
to increase the pressure on those in the compound and we all hoped 
as a way to move some of those out and bring it in  it wasn't 
presented as tomorrow is DDay this is it
	     
	     Q	  Is the President satisfied that A he had all this 
relevant information necessary to make a decision and B that Janet 
Reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh I think he's satisfied that 
they were acting on the best advice and the best information they 
had and he's not secondguessing it in any way whatsoever
	     
	     Q	  George was there a hour gap between 
conversations between the President and the Attorney General  In 
other words they spoke at  am and they didn't speak again 
until Clinton got back from dinner at 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that's likely yes
	     
	     Q	  Did he call her  What time did she call  Was 
there a gap between when she called him  I mean was he at dinner 
when she called and 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No no no  I think he called her 
last night  I couldn't swear to it but I believe he called her last 
night  He just wanted to talk to her
	     
	     Q	     what was going on
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not that I know of no
	     
	     Q	  What do you know about the situation now  Everyone 
has perished who  except eight or nine  And do you know any of the 
other details
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know any more details than 
the FBI reported in Waco
	     
	     Q	     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what 
is going on  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General how was 
he keeping track of what was going on here  I mean with all due 
respect to CNN is that how he was doing it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  There was also  as I said 
several people in the White House were in constant contact with their 
counterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information
	     
	     Q	  Who were those contacts  I mean was it Mack 
McLarty Webb Hubbell  How was the President being kept informed  
That's not a 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe Mack was in contact with 
Webb  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department  I 
believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department  
Either Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during 
the day with people at the Justice Department  We were fully briefed 
and fully informed
	     
	     Q	  We were told this morning that the President may 
have spoken  a chance that he may have spoken with Webb  Do you 
know if that's true or not
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think there's a chance he may 
have  I don't believe he did but I think there's certainly a chance 
that he may have at some point  I don't believe he did  I think 
that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with 

the Justice Department was the  am phone call with the 
Attorney General  But the White House was fully informed on a 
minutetominute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was 
happening at the Justice Department
	     
	     Q	  George who decided that the briefing would be done 
by the Attorney General
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The Attorney General
	     
	     Q	  Did you or did the White House communications staff 
 were you ever involved with that decision
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  We were told about it
	     
	     Q	  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil
Lehrer and all that stuff  Was that part of 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No
	     
	     Q	     there was no advice from the White House at all 
about her  she was on all night all day  Laughter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes and she did a very good job 
	     
	     Q	  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction 
to the situation be only a written statement which is traditionally 
the White House's way of distancing the President from the issue not 
having him appear as personally saying anything
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well that wasn't the intent at 
all  As I said we had to  we wanted to wait until we had all of 
the information at hand  The President is also making a statement 
today  The President made a statement yesterday morning  The 
President has been fully involved 
	     
	     Q	  After this turned into less than a successful 
operation the only statement from the President was what was on 
paper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to 
the major facts in this
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well it was the first statement 
from the President not the only statement from the President number 
one  
	     
	     Q	  After the 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Number two  well the first  
Number two the Attorney General 
	     
	     Q	  He gave a statement early in the morning when the 
thing was starting to move 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right  And he gave one yesterday 
and he's giving one today  Now the second point 
	     
	     Q	  It just happens this was a written statement with 
no sort of communications policy or thought process involved  It was 
the President wants to put out a written statement
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Knowing what we knew at the time 
we thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was 
appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and 
expressing his support for the Attorney General's 
	     
	     Q	  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do 
something

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well he did personally do so  
That is his statement  It's a statement under his name
	     
	     Q	  George yesterday during the briefing you didn't 
say the President took full responsibility for what happened 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I certainly did
	     
	     Q	  No what you said was 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's just not right Susan
	     
	     Q	  Well I think you can go back to the transcript I 
mean unless I miss something 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'd love to
	     
	     Q	     Janet Reno said that she took full 
responsibility and you said that she made the decision that the FBI 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  And the President takes 
responsibility  Absolutely
	     
	     Q	  Took responsibility  all right
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Check the transcript
	     
	     Q	  Considering how little was known about what was 
going on inside the compound and even now how little is known why 
is Washington calling this a mass suicide
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I think that knowing what we 
know now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and 
during it is painfully clear that those there were under his 
control
	     
	     Q	  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are 
concerned though isn't it George
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that that is an entirely 
different matter  I mean I think that David Koresh must bear 
responsibility for the deaths of those children absolutely  But he 
clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident 
and that's what he did
	     
	     Q	  You're still operating completely on assumption 
right  I mean you have no evidence or you know of no evidence that 
this was mass suicide
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We have evidence that those inside 
the compound set fire to the compound which led to the deaths of 
those inside
	     
	     Q	  I didn't quite hear it  This might be Ann's 
question I didn't quite hear it  But at what time did Clinton 
himself put out a statement on this  I know Dee Dee said some stuff 
on this at  pm but the President put out 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  At  pm  pm
	     
	     Q	  Right after the evening news went on the air
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No right when we had all the 
information  We were working on it
	     

	     Q 	  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the 
investigation the President is going to announce is going to be an 
administrationrun investigation  Why not have someone from the 
outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a 
political stake particularly those at the ATF whose actions have 
already been 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that clearly the ATF and 
the Justice Department will bear responsibility for the 
investigation  That's not to rule out as is often in investigations 
like this having some sort of independent involvement as well  But 
it will be run by the Treasury and Justice 
	     
	     Q	  Are you confident that you will not have any 
problem getting 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely
	     
	     Q	  George did the President reach out to anybody else 
to get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno  And who else in the 
White House sat in on that meeting  Anyone else from Justice
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't believe anybody else was 
there at the time  It was a phone call on Monday it wasn't a 
meeting
	     
	     Q	  Sunday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sunday  It was a phone call it 
wasn't a meeting  I believe he might have been there with Bruce but 
beyond that I think he just talked to the Attorney General
	     
	     Q	  George you said that in that phone call she said 
that we want to go in and take action as you said that will force 
him out  What did he think she was talking about  If he didn't know 
about tear gas what exactly was his idea of what he was approving
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think he was approving an action 
to increase the pressure on 
	     
	     qQ	   It didn't matter how she did that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No no  I mean 
	     
	     Q	  What information did he have in terms of how this 
would proceed  Presumably he would have wanted to know not minute
byminute but in a general sense 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think he knew that this was the 
recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the 
law enforcement agencies  I just don't know 
	     
	     Q	  What is this  when you say that this was the 
recommendation 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The action to increase pressure  I 
don't know exactly what he was told  whether he was going to be 
told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a 
hole in the window or whether he was just told generally that they 
were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure  I 
just don't know
	     
	     Q	  It's hard to imagine him not asking though
	     
	     Q	     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best 
advice about what they should go forward with he would have agreed
	     

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He was  he did ask some general 
questions about the advice and recommendation he gave  At the same 
time  and I would repeat  that this was based on the unanimous 
recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved
	     
	     Q	  George it would seem that this question about just 
exactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of 
the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere  Can you 
take that question and 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely  Yes
	     
	     Q	     get the answer and come back to us with all of 
it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting  a 
strategy session  where you and others decided we will put out a 
written statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be 
on all of these television broadcasts
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Never  Never
	     
	     Q	  And you never called the Justice Department and 
said to anyone or Janet Reno you're the one who needs to be out 
front explaining this
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not once
	     
	     Q	  It just happened that way that she was the 
spokesman that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  She made a decision as Attorney 
General that it was important for her as the operational officer in 
charge as the person who made the decision to go out and take the 
questions on this tragic incident
	     
	     Q	  She had no guidance from the White House at all
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We certainly didn't object
	     
	     Q	  But did you  laughter  no I'm sure you 
didn't object but did you suggest it  Was this a plan 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No Absolutely not
	     
	     Q	     a strategy
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No
	     
	     Q	  Did she clear it  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No
	     
	     Q	  Did she notify you
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We certainly knew about it
	     
	     Q	  What happened to this great detailed process you 
have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and 
every  under every rock and every place in government that 
something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion 
between you and the public information people at least at the Justice 
Department
	     

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The Attorney General made the 
decision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward  It seemed 
like a good decision  It was a good decision  She did a good job
	     
	     Q	  Let me ask it this way George if in hindsight how 
you would handle it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think it was handled very well
	     
	     Q	  You wouldn't change a thing if 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Change what
	     
	     Q	  The way the White House handled any part of it  
from start to finish
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I think that's an awful broad 
question and we're certainly going to have a review  One of the 
reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that 
something like this  see what we can learn from an incident like 
this and see what we can learn about how to handle them  If you're 
talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences no 
there  wouldn't make any change at all
	     
	     Q	  Two questions  First of all on her going on TV 
no White House people or outside media consultants came up with this 
idea  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the 
campaign
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  How so
	     
	     Q	  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline 
after the draft story watching Clinton on 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  There's absolutely no comparison  
Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident  The incident ended 
in tragic deaths of many many people  The Attorney General was 
involved in that decision  The Attorney General made the decision to 
do that  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of 
public information to go out and take the questions of the press in 
order to make sure that all of the questions were answered and she 
did a fantastic job
	     
	     Q	  The second question is did  as someone who knows 
Clinton as well as you do can you understand why it's sort of hard 
to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about 
what she intended to do  In other words she came and she said I'm 
going to put pressure on them  It's hard not to see Clinton who's 
fairly intelligent and inquisitive asking how
	     
	     Q	  What kind
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Both the Attorney General said that 
he did ask questions he did ask general questions  I don't have a 
minutebyminute account of the conversation
	     
	     Q	  How long a conversation
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think it was about  minutes
	     
	     Q	  Telephone conversation
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  George was the federal cost of this standoff ever 
a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure 
	     

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't believe so no
	     
	     Q	  George you keep saying that the President takes 
full responsibility but then you refer to it as her decision  Does 
the President not accept the fact that as CommanderInChief it is 
ultimately his decision
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know what this has to do 
with CommanderInChief  This was a law enforcement action not a 
military action  And he clearly takes responsibility for the 
decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his 
government  I mean I think there's just no ambiguity about that
	     
	     Q	  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as 
hers or is he saying it's her decision  There's a difference
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As a matter of fact it was her 
decision  He did not object to that decision  He clearly takes full 
responsibility 
	     
	     Q	  George this briefing has gone on just a little 
over  minutes and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged  
What exactly did they spend  minutes talking about if it was just 
very general  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It is an awful long phone 
conversation  It was a very important phone conversation  I think 
Brit has asked that we take the question and I've said that I would
	     
	     Q	  One of the things Reno said last night is that the 
buck stops here  I think that was her direct quotation  Does the 
President agree with that in this case
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President says he accepts full 
responsibility  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that 
she made a decision that she's going to accept all the 
responsibility that comes to her  And she's not shrinking from that 
at all but neither is the President 
	     
	     Q	  At any point in the conversation last night between 
the President and the Attorney General or this morning did she ever 
offer her a resignation
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not to my knowledge 
	     
	     Q	  Even before the fire was out yesterday there were 
some Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation  Is 
the White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests 
trying to make political hay out of this situation
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  And I don't want to cast any 
questions about the motives of those who are requesting 
investigation  We want an investigation and we'll have a full and 
complete investigation
	     
	     Q	  In what forum will you answer Brit's question  
Will you put out a written statement  Will you  the wires  How 
will you answer the question that you've taken
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm just not sure
	     
	     Q	  George can you remind us what the President was 
doing all yesterday afternoon where he was and what meetings he was 
involved in
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'll have to try and remember  He 
had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during 

the afternoon  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and 
getting periodic reports on that as well  He did see some on CNN as 
well  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as 
well
	     
	     Q	  And those reports would have come to him from Mack 
McLarty would they  do you think
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Mack talked to him Bruce talked to 
him I talked to him
	     
	     Q	  George to follow Helen's question in their 
conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last 
night in response to the question about whether she would resign  
Did he say I don't know why you felt the need to say that  I'm here 
to reassure you that you don't have to do this  Did that come up at 
all
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if it even came up 
that specifically  I know that the bulk of the conversation was 
discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation 

	     
	     Q	   The didn't talk at all about her kind of 
remarkable comment last night about 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I believe she was asked a 
question
	     
	     Q	  And her response was if the President wants me to 
I will
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Which would be I think the 
standard response that most Cabinet members would give  I mean it's 
a conditional statement
	     
	     Q	     have a need to talk about whether  personally 
about whether the President wanted her 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if they talked about 
it  I mean what I learned about the conversation was that it was 
largely about the investigation itself  And this just didn't come 
up  I did not ask the question if they talked about 
	     
	     Q	  Will you take that with the Brit package
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Certainly  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  George for the record does the President want her 
to resign  I know Dee Dee answered this morning 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely not  He supports Janet 
Reno  She's a good Attorney General  She's done a good job  She 
handled a difficult situation extremely well
	     
	     Q	  George does the President feel that he and Janet 
Reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law 
enforcement experts on the ground
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  And the President is not 
secondguessing that decision and those recommendations in any way  
That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life  
Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation  But the best 
judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best 
information we had
	     

	     Q	  George the minute conversation was the one on 
Sunday is that correct
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  How long was the one at  am yesterday 
morning
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know  I'll take that 
question too
	     
	     Q	  Were these outside experts that they were 
consulting with or experts within the ATF and the FBI
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  You'd have to ask them  I'm just 
not sure  I know that there were several experts
	     
	     Q	  And also why weren't there replacements for these 
people  Is the unit that small  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I think it is a very small 
highlyspecialized unit  But I think it's one of the kinds of things 
that the investigation will examine
	     
	     Q	  George isn't there a factor here involving the FBI 
Director  Normally a president when he wants to get information 
doesn't only asks the Attorney General  I know the chain of command  
But presidents talk to their FBI directors  In this case throughout 
this entire siege he has not felt that he could pick up the phone 
and talk to Bill Sessions who is from Waco and get expertise from 
him on what to do and what not to do
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think he talked to the FBI 
Director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke 
out in Waco  At the same time the Attorney General bears the 
ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the 
Attorney General
	     
	     Q	  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that 
Director Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is 
briefed and on the way that all of this evolved
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not at all  I mean it's perfectly 
appropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the 
Attorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director and 
that's following the chain of command
	     
	     THE PRESS  Thank you 

                                 END                     PM EDT

I saw in the Cleveland Plain Dealer this morning a report that the CEV

personal experience that burning type devices start fires  I certainly
put out enough of them in the pine forests of Ft Benning in the summer
of '  I'd like to know if they really threw burning CS grenades

It has been reported that the Davidians were using straw to baricade the
windows and to provide insulation With all that straw around I would be
very surprised if the CS cannisters did not start a fire

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the
impact not from the fire

	Thoughts

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

There's this minor thing called interest of finalityrepose  What
it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again
because the losing side discovers some new evidence  I don't know
about you Brett but I suspect GM had the resources to find just
about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial
started  Letting them reopen the case now is practically an
invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole
in case the verdict goes against him

BTW in federal criminal cases Rule  does permit a motion for a new
trial based on    newly discovered evidence if made within 
years of the verdict  Emphasis mine  If you're trying to make a
backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has
little to do with criminal trials  as the estimable David Brock did
in his amusing WSJ piece last week  save your breath



	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be 
believed 
Shouldn't that be up to a jury

Yup  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time
through 


	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  Shouldn't that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial
	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective

Unless there's some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated
the trial as opposed to being a product of it and that GM was
unfairly prevented from discovering it by venireman concealment or
otherwise why should GM be allowed to complain

There's a guy on death row in Texas that was denied a new trial dispite

I recommend the book Adams v Texas the story of a man Adams who
was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit  Most of the book
is the story of the long appeals process and the problems and delays
caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts

 I really don't want to waste time in
 here to do battle about the legalization of drugs  If you really want to we
 can get into it and prove just how idiotic that idea is  

  Read I do not know what the fuck I'm talking about and am
not eager to make a fool of myself

Oh you foolish person  I do know what the fuck I'm talking about
and will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you
wish

The legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits
so highly taunted by its proponents  safer cheaper drugs along
with revenues from taxes on those drugs reduced crime and reduced
organized crime specifically etc etc

Ahhh the classic Truth By Blatant Assertion technique  Too bad it's
so demonstrably false  Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a 
nice history on drug criminalization  The evidence there shows that
during periods of time when drugs such as heroin were illegal crime
went up and people did die from bad drugs  During times when drugs
were legalized those trends were reversed


If you would like to prove how clueless you are we can get into
why  again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group
was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little
research

Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof  Gosh I'm convinced
  for the humor impaired  First assert something for which you
have no evidence then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know
what this group was intended for  As to research if you'd done any
at all you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that
legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society  There are some
plausible arguments against it too but they aren't enough to convince
me that criminalization of drugs is the answer  I'm willing to be
convinced I'm wrong but I seriously doubt the likes of you can do it

Why don't the Republicans get their act together and say they
will support a broadbased VAT that would have to be visible
the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform 

       The Republicans are in general fighting any tax increase
There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase
incrementally

I was a graduate student in the early s and we had a conference on 
Reaganomics where Jerry Jordan then a member of the Council of Economic 
Advisors was a speaker  I had the pleasure of driving him back to the 
airport afterwards and since taxes were the main topic of discussion I 
thought I would ask him about the VAT  I have favored it for these reasons 
you mention that the income base is too hazy to define that it taxes 
savings and investment that it is likely to be more visible  He agreed 
and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT  So why not 
propose it  I asked  He replied that the Reagan White House feared that 
the Democrats would introduce VAT in addition to the income tax rather 
than in lieu  Better not to give them any ideas he said

Pretty prescient

       BTW what is different between Canada's tax and most of
Europe's that makes it visible

Yes any Canadian readers please tell us if the tax is displayed on price 
stickers I'm relatively certain it is not in Europe

                    Office of the Press Secretary


For Immediate Release                             April       

                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
           DURING PRESENTATION OF TEACHER OF THE YEAR AWARD
	     
                           The Rose Garden 


 PM EDT


	     THE PRESIDENT  Good afternoon  Please be seated  I 
want to say first how delighted I am to be here with Secretary 
Riley and with Senator Graham  The three of us served as governors 
together during the s when we worked constantly on strategies to 
improve our schools when we led often difficult and long efforts to 
upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the 
quality of instruction our children were receiving  
	     
	     There were no two governors whom I admired more during 
that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher 
of the Year  And I think both of them would join me in saying that 
after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been 
passed and the funds have been raised and allocated it all comes 
down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the 
classroom
	     
	     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National 
Teacher of the Year is so important  Tracey Leon Bailey is one 
recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative 
science programs  He's developed and introduced into Florida's 
classrooms cuttingedge programs in molecular biology and DNA 
fingerprinting  subjects usually taught only in college and I 
might add probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's 
Capital  Laughter
	     
	     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high 
school Mr Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science 
programs in the entire state of Florida and it won numerous national 
and international awards  These advanced programs aren't just for a 
favored few  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students 
including those previously known as lowachieving or atrisk to reach 
for excellence and to attain it  This is what our students need and 
what our country needs 
	     
	     Today we know that a good future with high wages and 
rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a 
lifetime  The basics aren't enough anymore  All our kids need 
competence in math and science and advanced problemsolving  That's 
why Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so 
pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these 
accomplishments 
	     
	     Tracey you represent the best in the United States  
I'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this 
Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for   Applause  
	     
	     MR BAILEY  Thank you Mr President  It is indeed a 
great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 
 million teachers  And we appreciate the support that you have 
shown for education and we're looking forward to working with you to 
help redesign and improve our nation's schools  
	     
	     We know that the quality of our children's education 
will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape 
in the years to come  And we thank you so much for your continued 
support and commitment to our children's education  Thank you again  
Applause

	     THE PRESIDENT  In closing I would like to also welcome 
the education leaders in Florida who are here those representing the 
national education groups who have also come  I'd like to recognize 
Tracey's congressman Representative Jim Bacchus in the back himself 
a great advocate of education  And I'd like to remind all of you 
that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award 
is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to 
people all across this country who give their lives to our children 
all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their 
best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of 
America  They are in so many ways our most important public 
servants
	     
	     Thank you very much  Applause
	     
                                 END PM EDT

It is interesting sometimes to listen to US news as seen through
the eyes of another country

BBC world news service on shortwave originating out of London
reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank when
making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
lamp and that is how the fire started  Attempts were made by the
people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly

Has anyone in US heard anything similar or are US government
spindoctors censoring such information

The BBC news is also reporting that about  of those that died
were british citizens

      This is pretty much what Koresh's lawyers were told by the
      remaining survivors on Larry King LIve  In addition parts 
      of the unsealed warrant were mentioned  It surely sounds 
      as if the BATF were in VIOLATION from day ONE

	Then again if the fire was accidental why didn't more

the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it

They had a surefire method keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looneytune religious
stunt

Phil I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you
will back anything no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone
else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like  It's people
with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust a process
that is in place now in this country even if the tattered pitiful remains
of the Constitution is slowing its progress  This isn't a Libertarian issue
others may argue that line but from a strictly Constitutional view of a
democratic gov't what the FBI and BATF did was wrong wrong wrong even if
their reasons for trying to arrest Koresh were  right  Anything that
leads to the deaths of  children if nothing else touches your stoney
heart is wrong no matter who pushed the button  For God's sake man get
your morality back

The person who murdered  children was Koresh He kept them there and 
brought about their deaths deliberately

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap
Thats quite true I don't pretend to be Being nice is what amateurs
try to do If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children Anyone who has held the office of President
of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA
or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear 
Holocaust in order to protect freedom Beleive it or not that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make Do they have a gun nutters
section of the US version of CND by any chance


There are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as Koresh or Hitler If it were not for the consideration
of the  children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance It is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide

The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire If proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero

I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse

Let me see if I got this right

Group of religious plinter schismatics erect a compound
and after at least fifty years of peaceful coexistance
with the outside community having shoot outs only with
each other  this makes them dangerous  Prior history
would seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves

Last I knew there was no National Branch Davidian Party
blaming the debacle in VeitNam on Foreign Meddlers and
threetwo beer calling for the Rounding up of Meat Packers
Growers and Slaughter Houses

You want tough political choices  how about letting odd balls
be odd balls  I know this requires tolerance for 
those that go into Government  but we all know people
who have no useful skills


ith the death of the children everybody is getting
real upset  what about the other  plus people
I suppose that you consider children to be property
of the state with the family as custodians In the
States its the other way around  children are parental property
If what you consider a Corrupt Government demands that
you send you children into their tender care  I
suppose that you will obey the State and turn you children
over to their care  Sorry  I am not as enamoured of the
womb to tomb cradle that is IngSoc

                         The White House


                  Office of the Press Secretary


For Immediate Release                             April  



                     Background Information

                    Advancing US Relations 
        with Russia and the other New Independent States 

                         April  


At the Vancouver summit President Clinton and President Yeltsin 
agreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an 
economic and strategic partnership between the US and Russia  
Since then President Clinton has directed that a number of steps 
be taken to move this process forward  The Administration is 
announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its 
deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based 
on its government's commitment to reform


Executive Review of Cold War Laws

President Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the 
desirability of reviewing and updating US laws and regulations 
to reflect the end of the Cold War  Congress has already acted 
to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet 
Union has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other 
independent states  However many laws and regulations remain 
that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the 
end of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations 
with Russia and the other new independent states

The President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and 
regulations so that where appropriate and consistent with US 
security and other national interests such provisions can be 
revised or removed  He has asked Ambassadoratlarge Strobe 
Talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis  The 
President has indicated that he will welcome congressional 
efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible

This review will weigh all considerations that pertain to 
revision of such provisions and the initiation of the review may 
help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such 
provisions in the past  For example because the Russians are 
eager to have their status changed under the JacksonVanik 
legislation President Yeltsin personally assured President 
Clinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases 
involving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia  By 
addressing such issues this review can help strengthen the bonds 
of trust and partnership between the US and Russia and between
the US and the other new independent states


Review of COCOM

It is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies 
the future of another Cold War institution  the Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls COCOM  The United 
States has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export 
controls to the postCold War world in which Russia is no longer 
viewed as a potential adversary but as a potential ally in 
combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology

Steps to Improve the Security Relationship

The President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of 
efforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen US security 
and improve our security relationship with the Russians and the 
other states


Accelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons

In Vancouver the two Presidents discussed accelerating the 
process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for 
elimination under the START I Treaty  President Clinton has 
directed the Department of Defense to complete this process well 
in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START 
I  In addition the United States together with Russia and the 
other relevant states of the former Soviet Union will be 
exploring programs under NunnLugar to help them to accelerate 
this process


Multilateral Test Ban

The two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a 
multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date 
and that the two governments would consult with each other 
accordingly  The United States looks forward to beginning 
consultations with Russia our allies and other states on the 
specific issues related to this negotiation  The United States 
expects to start this consultative process within the next two 
months    


Detargeting

The two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear 
targeting at Vancouver  As the United States and Russia move 
into a new relationship of strategic partnership there is a need 
to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the 
past to safeguard US security against a nuclear adversary  The 
Administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures 
that could enhance strategic stability including recent 
proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles   

Other Measures to Create a New Security Relationship

In response to the incident involving a collision between US and 
Russian submarines last month Secretary Aspin will be ready to 
discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian 
Defense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in 
late May

Secretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with 
Defense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training 
program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint 
exercises in peacekeeping such as that authorized by the UN 
Security Council  The United States looks forward to broadening 
such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping 
contributors in order to improve interoperability readiness 
and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations  The US 
and Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial 
Meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for 
enhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move 
consideration of the SecretaryGeneral's Agenda for Peace from 
the discussion to the implementation phase  The US is also 
working with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements 
in the financing and management of UN operations  The purpose of 
these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our 
participation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions


Multilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform

Finally the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of 
initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and 
political reformers throughout Russia and the other states  The 
Administration is continuing work with our G partners to 
assemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries 
Bentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo  And the 
Administration is continuing consultation with Congress over the 
further efforts the US will take to assist the process of 
reform in Russia and the other states

                                   

The Administration believes these steps can increase American

  The Comsymp ZOG wants you to think that it is the only legitimate
               
  possessor of nuclear weapons  

 The use of the term ZOG which I understand stands for Zionist
 Occupation Government or some such bullshit was used for satiric
 purpose  Since the posting I was responding to was on altconspiracy
 among other crossposted groups I composed a satiric message
 using jargon sometimes found on that group  I figured that the
 content and context of the message was so absurd that no one would
 take any part of it completely seriously

It was absurd all right but no different from the weekly so then do you
believe that the right to keep and bear arms means everybody can own nuclear 
bombs posting in tpg  Sorry I missed the crossposting

 As far as guns go I support the Bill of Rights  all of it  and
 if you wish to arm yourself to the teeth by all means do so
 However the concept of a  calibre machine gun as a sporting weapon
 for target practice or otherwise struck and continues to strike me
 as moderately absurd even if constitutionally protected

Only if you believe that the constitutional protection is limited to
sporting arms  Oddly enough the Supreme Court has ruled exactly the
opposite  the Second protects militia arms but NOT necessarily sporting 
ones

Speaking of absurd the subsequent argument is usually Isn't owning
militia arms a little outdated  I mean who really thinks they are 
going to need these things to take on government troops  

But strangely enough we aren't hearing much of that argument this week

 Let me explain some possible means to libertarianstyle government
 one last time

 If the dominate philosophy of a society held that it was OK to kill your
 neighbor for sport no government system except a strong tyranny by the
 minority could keep the people from killing each other

 The dominate philosophy in our society holds that it is OK for people to
 steal and coerce each other as long as it's done by vote or through the
 government machine  Libertarians realize what this legal stealing and
 coercion does to a society

 So just as a society of nonmurderers would not vote for the right to
 murder a society of noncoercers would not vote for the ability to
 coerce

 If libertarianism became the dominate philosophy the people would do a
 good job of restraining government to the extent that libertarianism
 was dominate

 So means  is educating the people to become libertarian

Well that's the obvious conclusion given your train of logic  The
corollary then is that it must be a waste of time for the party to run
candidates until the educational program has shown some results

   They raided an American's property because of rumors about
     Koresh's intentions with some converted yet still ndamendment
     protected firearms a judgeapproved warrant justifies nothing

 In a democracy under the rule of law a search warrant justifies a 
 search

And this search procedure must also follow the rule of law

 The US constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to 
 mount a search for illegally held weapons

It may if necessary when the search is executed in an illegal and
violent fashion

 The Govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases Attempts to 
 capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others
 is one 

These criminals were threatening the lives of NO ONE  they were fired 
on FIRST according to a number of accounts

 In this case they used sub lethal force 

Wrong  Firing a gun at someone is lethal force even if no one is hit
Of course they DID hit AND kill people

 The children were held hostage The adults were wanted variously for murder
 and conspiracy to murder

You are silly  There are no such warrants in existence Phill

   It took hundreds of gov't agents with taxfunded cellular phones
     ten minutes to dial  for the fire department

 They should not have called the fire dept at all There was no role
 for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might
 well shoot at them Calling the fire dept meant that WACO was deprived
 of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation 
 where it could have been used arisen

Thanks Phill for another example of that great socialist sensitivity
Obey the government or die

Koresh  some of his followers were tried and found innocent of

 fire to the house as the result of some other act but deliberatly 
 burning the house to get them to come out would be murder if any of
 them died
 

Read the articles about the arrest of Randy Weaver  The BATF were on
the verge of using these very tactics on a house containing children and
were only stopped by the arrival of the press on the scene

Doesn't seem like those responsible for the assault were very concerned
about the welfare of the children inside  Seems like they were more
interested in flexing their muscle before the media  My reasoning
Just ask yourself this one question

Suppose the scenario was slightly different and we had Chelsea Clinton
being kidnapped by terrorists holed up in a compound for  days
Do you think Clinton Reno the FBI and the ATF would be so eager
to use a show of force

Nuff said

Janet Reno killed the Waco children  She is responsible for
their deaths  She should resign immediately  She should have 
understood that David Koresh was a madman who would do anything
against the children if he became provoked  All the warning 
signs were there and she ignored them  She provoked Koresh
into killing the children

she provoked koresh  excuse me but David Koresh killed 
the inhabitants of that compound not a gov't official  These people 
were controlled by koreshhe killed them a long time ago
when he refused to release the children and other hostages as you 
call them in your comparison

    This is the first I hear that Koresh refused to release
    someone  In fact a lot of people including children came out
    during the standoff

    How do you know Koresh killed his followers  The FBI said
    he had had no such plans and they had the place bugged Koresh's 
    attorney said the same thing and the survivors claimed that the 
    fire was started by goverment agents

	I was slightly surprised to see the Guns of Roston open up on me here
But Gerry has his posting record and I have mine Although I'm usually more 
polite than Gerry is I'm not afraid of controversy either If this looks like
an argument that he started just to be contrary or to pander to the sciskeptic
masses to say nothing of the libertarian masses I'll certainly bow out

In article tecsuntecarmymil riggsdescartesetlarmymil Bill Riggs writes

	   One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
   the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday One can argue about
   the initial raid but it would be worth mentioning before the facts get
   lost that

	    The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	   during the initial raid

	    The Branch Davidians opened fire first

Sigh I was waiting some some notsointelligent person to bring this
up  Look this is a country of laws To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance

 th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses 
 papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 
 shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon 
 probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and 
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
 or things to be seized 

	The first question is Did the 'tipoff' call indicate to the
Branch Davidians that a noknock warrant was in use and they could
therefore presumably go into 'Weapons Free' once the compound property 
was entered  The second question is What makes Gerry think that the
Davidians' actions would have been different had another type of warrant
been in use 

	I'd like to see both of these questions answered before seeking
judgment as to any claims about my IQ


No a noknock warrant is in clear violation of the th amendment
Okay what about the fact that they were tipped off  they shouldn't
have opened fire  right  WRONG  Think about this I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a noknock warrant So
being moronic sheep we wait with our guns holstered Now instead of
the Feds in comes my competition and we're history  The only
acceptable answer to a noknock warrant is blazing guns  I may sound
paranoid but our government is out of control and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it

	A spurious analogy especially for one so skeptical as Gerry 
The Davidians were NOT drug dealers and by all accounts feared no one
but the Feds Any evidence to the contrary

Actually ONE of the survivors say it was started by the FBI tank knocked over lamp  Another said the Davidians set the fire themselves

	Actually that is not quite accurate Avraam's lawyer has been quoted as
claiming that Avraam says the fire was started by a tank knocking over a keroscene
lamp Avraam HIMSELF was quoted today in the Washington Post as stating that
he overheard the following words on the second story of the compound before
jumping out a window to safety

Yes we've heard that the survivors are now saying that We've also
seen the videotape which shows that the fire started in two or
three different places which weren't near the tank

    I have not seen the tape on CNN  Which network did you see it on

I saw the film on CNN as it happend It was clear from that tape that
the fire started in ONE location Right where the tank was attacking
and then had pulled back 

No this is not true the CNN pictures show two sites clearly and a third is
barely distinguished 

If you have a tape you should note that there are two towers at either end
of the building a big one and a little one What appears to be merely a 
long shot of the big tower with the tank in front is in fact the little
tower You can tell beacuse the flag in the foreground switches sides from the
right of the picture to the left

The third site is visible as the flames clearly come from a point obscured by
the small tower You need a tape and a good slow motion video to see this

  What crap Phil mm Wrong To give you a clue as to how big mm is the
 F fighter aircraft have mm gattling guns used to shoot down other 
 aircraft A mm gun would be somewhere in the cannon' realm They might
 have had  calibre but definitely not mm 



I think that Phil needs to get out a ruler and see exactly how big mm rounds
are  roughly  diameter  The type of stuff used in AntiAircraft gunnery
 calibre is much smaller but the m effective range mi sounds about

Then there is the rumour that Loresh in fact survived the fire in a secret
hideyhole and rose again on the third day only to be spirited away by
FBI agents and disposed of in order to prevent a cult following

The source of the fire is variously attributed to a deliberate act on the
part of the FBI an accident or an act of God

In the same way I really like the miracle amunition belt story The
idea being that in a just cause God will supply amunition fear not
for the Lord himself shall place the arrows in your bow Neat eh The
BATF agents were thus definitively shot by the will of God himself I
can't see why they needed the million rounds of ammo though in that
case


If you have some Koresh material that hasn't gone to the net then please
send it to me In particular I really do want to see the book of Koresh
but no making one up please I want the real Mcoy the one the Feds
discoverd on the third day in a box with seven seals and are suppressing


I will editorialize for the benefit of the net to produce a definitive
history 


I would prefer though to have genuine rather than made to measure Koreshia
There are plenty of genuinly unhinged loons so as to not need to start
making it up Of course if you are an unhinged loon then I want to hear
from you

Can people please stop the 'I thinkknow the BATFFBI are completely
responsible but they'll cover it up so that the investigation will
show that Koresch is responsible' bs In an investigation of this
size with the feds state and civilians involved in the
investigation it would be practially impossible to cover up

	The place has burned to the ground  The FBI and company
have the whole area cordoned off and have already arrested 
reporters for being at the site and taking pictures

	All your going to get in terms of a story is what the FBI ATF
and the Texas Rangers decide to release  



And with Republicans like Arlen Spector calling for investigations
this isn't going to be handled with kid gloves
 
	When the Philadephia cops dropped their bomb on MOVE and
managed to burn down an entire neighborhood many people said 
the same thing  Dead men and rubble tell no tales that the
police dont want them to tell  

	You can judge the real political mood on this from the
fact that Congressperson Pat Scroder is a  supporter of
the FBI's actions  She was on television this week saying that
the cost of the operation in Waco was a valid reason for the
storming and gassing of the compound

Yesterday the FBI was saying that at least three of the bodies had
gunshot wounds indicating that they were shot trying to escape the
fire  Today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there
is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies

At the beginning of this siege it was reported that while Koresh
had a class III machine gun license today's paper quotes the
government as saying no they didn't have a license

Today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with
shoulder weapons next to them as if they had been using them while
dying  which doesn't sound like the sort of action I would expect
from a suicide

Our government lies as it tries to cover over its incompetence
and negligence  Why should I believe the FBI's claims about
anything else when we can see that they are LYING

This system of government is beyond reform

  Ahh what's good for the goose is not necessarily what's good for
  the gander  You don't want homosexuals to impose their moral codes
  such diabolical ideas as equal rights on you yet you are willing
  to impose your moral codes on them  Do I detect a double standard
  
  garison
 
 What do you mean  If adults want to get together for sodomy in
 private that's their business
 
 And that's precisely what they do  So what's your problem with the queer
 population boyo  The only difference between us is what we do in
 privatewho we love
 
 bi    Andrew D Simchik					SCHNOPIA

Do it in private and it won't be a problem  But the reason that
the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is
that they want

 To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work and
not have people get disgusted

 To be able to wear their NAMBLA Tshirt and not worry about
getting fired

 To be able to have access to young boys so that they start
making the next generation of homosexuals

If your right to privacy is what makes sodomy laws unconstitutional
a position that I agree with then keep it private and there
won't be a problem

 A very well put together post I disagree with several key points but the
 post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse

I agree wholeheartedly  Paul you have handled this so well
I think that you could write ballot materials

 Thank you  I'd hoped to avoid the rancor that has characterized much
 of the debate on this issue  I'm also not going to prolong the debate
 on this  I wanted to respond to a couple of the points you make but
 this will be my last posting on this

No don't stop

 Right to Equal Opportunity lets call it REO involves coercion in all cases
 by definition

 One question  is it your position that there is no REO  Or just that
 this is a lesser right to FOA

Good question  It just depends  How's that for an answer  
Seriously I believe that it depends on wether or not you are
talking about a governmental employer or not  In this case I
believe that there should be absolutely no discrimination
direct or indirect period  I feel this way not because it would
offend my moral sensibilities which it of course would but
because the government is a coercive entity which we cannot
escape  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime there were
whites only drinking fountains in some parks but no fountains
for others yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains
certainly were not applied to whites only  In essence we
cannot escape the coercive state  Even Randy Weavers have to pay
property tax  On the other hand private employers are not a
monopoly and their businesses should be run by them and not by
the government unless they elect to turn their affairs over to
that government

 Why Says who Why can mom  pop have FOA but IBM be forced and force is
 the correct word here to have REO

 In the case of the mom  pop store their FOA is directly affected  They
 as individuals will have to associate with whomever they hire  In the
 case of IBM I ask again whose FOA are we protecting  I do not accept
 that IBM as a corporate entity has a right to FOA

But if the mom  pop store is affected by who they hire
isn't IBM  There is a slippery slope here  In Santa Cruz
where a number of loony antidiscrimination laws exist
a guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had
every imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe
and his tatoos were very distracting

 Suddenly by arm waving by magic a landlord does not have FOA And on
 what basis does the FOA of the landlord disappear

 It seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice

 On the basis that the landlord has no contact with hisher tenants  If
 the landlord doesn't associate with his tenants then how can he complain
 that his FOA is being violated

I have a lot of interaction all positive with my tenants
so I guess that that isn't an issue  But say I were to buy
a unit in another town and have it managed by a third party
Let's say that I have a real aversion to Christians because
of the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker and
because of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected
I don't want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window
of a house that I own  Should the government intervene  If
I was Elie Weizel and the only rental applicant was Tom
Metzger should I be forced to rent this distant unit to him

 The companies on the Fortune  for example are all privately owned They
 can give you a list of all of their owners They have no anonymous
 unknown to them owners

 Publicly owned in the sense that their stock is publicly traded and that
 the shares of stock are owned by a generic and everchanging public

Yes and the neat thing about this is that unlike the mom 
pop store you and I can buy shares in IBM and have influence
over their decision making policies if we don't like them

Anyway Paul keep up the good work

   Can someone tell me why when Mr Cramer spouts on about homosexuals
   he only addresses homosexual men and never in any post I've read
   addressed lesbians
 
  I can't really speak for Mr Cramer here but I can say that a
  homosexual male is an entirely different animal than a lesbian
  There is virtually nothing that is analogous or related between the
  aberrant behaviors practiced by these two groups of deviants
 
 The last time I checked homosexual men and women were both human

I think Mr Kaldis was using the expression in the slang sense
though I agree it is NOT an appropriate expression to use in this
context

 They both prefer to engage in sexual acts with people of the same
 gender  There is nothing inherently wrong with the trademark behaviour
 of either homosexual men or homosexual women except in the minds of
 misinformed folk clueless folk and bigots
 
 So what makes homosexual men and homosexual women different animals
 
 Michael D Adams          starowlairahulnet          Enterprise Alabama

 That homosexual men are extremely promiscuous and homosexual women
are if any more promiscuous than heterosexual women it's not by
much

 That homosexual men are overrepresented among child molesters 
about  of child molestation is done by homosexual or bisexual
men while homosexual women don't appear to be similarly over
represented
